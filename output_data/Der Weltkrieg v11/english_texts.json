On January 27, two Russian divisions pushed the Austro-Hungarian front back to the valley of the Golden Bistritz along the railway from Kimpolung. The following day, they were able to gain more ground further south. Generaloberst von K\u00f6vess was forced to move parts of the German 1st Infantry Division, belonging to the Carpathian Corps, south into the threatened section to regain ground from which the enemy controlled the valley road of the Golden Bistritz. On February 12 and 13, parts of the German 1st and 117th Infantry Divisions, together with Austro-Hungarian troops, were able to recapture the positions on the railway after strong artillery preparation. Over 1200 prisoners, machine guns, mortars, and trench guns were captured. On February 27, the same troops wrested further parts of the lost positions from the enemy and took another 1300 prisoners. Russian counterattacks and relief attacks further north and at Kirlibaba, as well as against the section of Lieutenant General von Richthofen at the Tatar Pass, had no effect.\nOnly then did the grueling battles at the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army end. The grim winter weather in the high mountains continued to take a heavy toll through illnesses, frostbite, and exhaustion, especially since the supply situation was very difficult. Due to limited business roads, they generally had to make do with incomplete expansion of the positions, and yet considerable reserves could not be deployed.\nThe front of Archduke Josef assessed their situation at the end of February as follows: \"At present, there are no indications of the deployment of stronger Russian attack forces against the front. It is also unlikely that the enemy will deploy his available corps for an offensive through the mountains to Hungary, thereby weakening himself east or north of the Carpathians, where he can expect quicker decisive successes.\"\n</body>\n<header>2. Front of the Commander-in-Chief East.</header>\n<body>The front of the Commander-in-Chief East (Army Groups B\u00f6hm-Ermolli, Linsingen, Bothrich, and Eichhorn) was characterized by pure trench warfare. The Supreme Army Command was informed on December 30, 1916: \"The freezing of most watercourses, lakes, and swamps at Army Group Bothrich and Eichhorn has made it possible in many places to live-</body>\n", "052": "\n<pageno>385</pageno>\n<header>The Last Battles. \u2014 Transfer of Troops.</header>\n<body>goes beyond and we spare people and ammunition.\" Furthermore, in agreement with the Commander-in-Chief East, it assessed the situation on the Eastern Front as such that \"despite the withdrawal of considerable Russian forces, serious attacks at various points must still be expected.\" Before the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, they assumed rather too low than too high, still six to seven corps. Apart from the mentioned German operations, calm had set in at the beginning of November across the entire front, even in the most fiercely contested sections of Army Group Linsingen. Only with the Southern Army did local battles continue, where on November 30, the enemy, in an attack against the Turkish XV Corps, suffered once again greater bloody losses.\nOn November 10, a meeting of the general staffs of the German and Austro-Hungarian armies took place in Ple\u00df, to which the Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief East, Colonel Hoffmann, was also invited. It was mainly about what should happen if the suspected transport of further Russian forces to the south was confirmed. Since October, Army Group B\u00f6hm-Ermolli had been considering an attack in the direction over Tarnopol. The possibility of thereby supporting operations on the Romanian front and at the same time wresting Austrian territory conquered by the Russians seemed to grow in the same measure as the enemy weakened north of the Carpathians. However, these plans had to be temporarily set aside in favor of the question of which troops, including Austro-Hungarian, the Commander-in-Chief East could still give up without exchange and which divisions were suitable for exchange to the west. The result was that in the course of November, four more divisions were exchanged for those from the west. The impression that further transports were also taking place on the enemy side allowed, at the beginning of December, the transfer of five more divisions against only two worn-out ones from the west. Repeated noticeable increase in enemy artillery fire as well as probing by stronger Russian hunting commands and individual companies apparently aimed only at unsettling and complicating the numerous ongoing replacements.\nBy mid-December, the Commander-in-Chief East was of the opinion that Russian attack intentions were nowhere present at the time, except in the area of Mitau, where, based on repeated prisoner statements, such a possibility still had to be reckoned with. When General Ludendorff at this time launched an attack to bind Russian forces</body>\n", "067": "\n<pageno>400</pageno>\n<header>The Battles on the Russian Front.</header>\n<body>\nof which, however, 300 were medium and heavy, assumed1). The attack was \ninitially intended to collapse the German position projecting on both banks \nof the Aa through encirclement and then to pave the way on both sides \nof the river as well as along the railway from Riga to Mitau. On January 2, 1917, \nGeneral Radko Dmitrijew ordered the start for January 5. After a short but \npowerful artillery preparation, a composite division was to break through \nimmediately west of the Aa, and east of the river the VI Siberian Corps \nalong with two Latvian brigades, with a group of the II Siberian Corps of \nconsiderable divisional strength standing ready at the railway near Nai. \nThe enemy was to be tied down by smaller operations on the flanks of the \nattack area.\nThus, on January 5 at 5 a.m., the Russian attack began, as surprising \nfor the German command as for their troops. Heavy snowstorms favored it. \nAccording to the first reports, the Commander-in-Chief East reported to the \nSupreme Army Command: \"East of the Aa and east of Tukums shortly before \ndawn several Russian partial attacks, most of which have been repelled.\" \nOnly gradually was the extent of the battle recognized.\nIn the 30-kilometer-wide attacked area between the railway and the \nwestern Tirul swamp, only 16 battalions were available from the Mitau group. \nAfter short artillery strikes, mass attacks by the Russian infantry began, \napparently targeting Mitau. In most places, the enemy was bloodily repelled. \nHowever, in greater width, he had broken through the first position at Mangali. \nReserves threw themselves against him. They were pushed back to the second \nposition in a hard fight at Stangal. In the Mangaler break, the enemy broke \nthrough the German blockhouse line and penetrated some batteries in the \ndune terrain east of Kalnzem. West of the Aa, the Russian attacks on both \nsides of the Tirul swamp had no success.\nMeanwhile, parts of the army reserve provided by General von Scholz \nadvanced over Zirul through high snowdrifts and deep frozen swamp holes. \nThey regained Mangali and took over the adjacent positions from the enemy. \nThe crisis was overcome. Only the situation at the Mangaler break was not \nyet fully clarified. Here, the counterattack was to be carried out on January 6. \nHowever, it was delayed due to numerous frictions caused by difficul-\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) Above all, the number of medium and heavy guns was greatly exaggerated. \nThe actual strength of the entire German army, which far exceeded the front \nof the Russian 12th to the southwest, was 99 battalions, 567 guns, of which only \n275 were medium and heavy.\n</footer>\n", "063": "\n<pageno>396</pageno>\n<header>The Battles on the Russian Front.</header>\n<body>At the end of February, the Mackensen Army Group still had troops with a strength of 15 infantry divisions, eight of which were German.\nOn the enemy side, the heavily shaken Romanian units had been almost entirely replaced and withdrawn by Russian troops as early as the beginning of January. The Mackensen Army Group could thus assume that only Russians were in front of their line. They anticipated three enemy infantry divisions in front of the Bulgarian 3rd Army and 13 in front of the rest of the front, along with four to five cavalry divisions. They did not expect any attacks for the time being.\nA little later than the Mackensen Army Group, the Gerok Group of the Archduke Josef Army Front came to rest. They had to give up two German divisions. In view of the strong opposing enemy forces relative to their own front line, Field Marshal von Conrad requested that at least one of the two divisions remain with the army front. However, it was only after repeated insistence that the Supreme Military Command decided to comply with this request until the significantly reduced troop strengths of the Austro-Hungarian units had recovered; in February, the division could move west.\nFrom the Romanian troops still facing them in the Carpathians, the commander of the 3rd Division, Colonel Culcaba, who was friendly to the Germans, reported to the troops of General von Gerok in the Casin Valley on February 6. He hoped \u2014 as he stated \u2014 that many Romanians would follow his example and wanted to form free corps against the Russians, who would never give up this area again after the withdrawal of Romanian troops from Moldova. However, his expectations were not fulfilled; his example found no imitation. However, the replacement of Romanian forces by Russian ones continued in the Casin Valley. On February 28, individual advances began against the entire front of the Gerok Group, but they had no success.\nOn the high mountain front of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, due to winter snowstorms and cold, the further north one went, the less possibility there was for large-scale battles. Here, too, a German division was relieved.\nOn the southern flank of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army\u00b9) in the forested Carpathians, Russian attacks in January and February still led to varied battles. As early as January 3, the Russians had succeeded north of Jacobeni in advancing over a width and depth of several kilometers</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Continuation on p. 363.</footer>\n", "066": "\n<pageno>399</pageno>\n<body>and thus posed an operational threat. If the enemy broke through here and even managed to take the important railway junction of Mitau, he could destabilize the entire German D\u00fcna front beyond Jakobstadt. Extensive swamp areas in front of the German front on both sides of the Aa excluded such an attack during most of the year. Therefore, only weak troops, essentially consisting of Landwehr and Landsturm, were deployed here as Group Mitau under Lieutenant General von Pappritz (General Command z. b. V. 60, Chief of the General Staff Colonel Nebbel), totaling 48 battalions and 316 partly unlimbered older guns (of which 115 were medium and heavy). The opposing enemy, parts of the Russian 12th Army under General Radko Dimitriew, was \u2014 as far as was known \u2014 not strong; it largely consisted of newly formed Latvian volunteer troops\u00b9).\nIn the confusing forest and swamp area, the foremost German position consisted of fortification groups on high sand dunes, between which support points and blockhouse lines set on the ground in the lowlands established the connection with flanked obstacles. A few kilometers further back ran a still little-developed second position. Since the end of December, the frost had made all watercourses and swamps passable, thus depriving the position of its protection. General von Pappritz had requested reserves, but they were not given to him, as no reinforcement was apparent on the enemy side either, given the overall situation. On December 31, the situation back there was \u2014 \"Enemy purely defensive, shows increased entrenchment activity, has withdrawn the moderately combat-effective VI Siberian Corps from the front.\" According to prisoner statements, it was assumed that the corps was to be transferred to Romania, while the XXXXIII Corps, consisting of Landwehr, had taken its place.</body>\n<header>Defense Against the Russian Attack.</header>\n<body>On the Russian side, the commander-in-chief of the northern front, General Ruzski, had already decided in mid-December to exploit the frost weather for an attack on Mitau.

In the main thrust direction, towards Wladimir-Wolynsk, where the 8th Army suffered unusually high losses, the attack had to be halted on the 21st, and by the 11th and 7th Army on September 24. Only the 9th Army in the Carpathians showed some significant progress. The military leadership wanted to shift the focus there in the future. On September 23, they returned the Special Army to the Southwestern Front to reinforce the left wing of the 7th and 9th Army. The former was then to attack at Kalu\u015f, the latter at Besztercze and S\u00e4chsisch-Regen. However, General Brussilow managed to ensure that instead of reinforcement and attack by the 7th Army, the offensive on Kowel was attempted once more.\nSome time had to pass before the plans could be implemented. Meanwhile, General Joffre again urged and primarily demanded a sharp offensive in the Dobrudja against the Bulgarians, but at the same time communicated that decisive cooperation from the Salonika Army could not be expected. General Alexejew countered with the demand that this army be reinforced by the Western powers. His decisions and measures had almost no impact. They only showed how little the assessment of the situation matched the hopes tied to Romania's entry into the war, and how little the new ally could actually be helped.\nInadequate railway connections played a significant role. The transport duration for a corps from the middle of the Russian front to Moldavia or even Dobrudja had to be calculated at a minimum of two weeks. There were four, albeit single-track, continuous lines to Moldavia and the Danube estuary: 1. directly behind the front via Roman to Bacau\u2013Focsani, 2. via Jassi to Sociani\u2013Galatz (single-track up to that point) and further across the Danube to Reni, finally 3. from Bendery directly to the Danube to Reni, finally 4. double-track to Sevastopol and from there by sea in one night to the Danube estuary or to Constanza. In each case, except for the journey to Reni, transshipment was necessary, either from Russian gauge to Central European (Romanian) or to the ship. To what extent these transport possibilities were utilized cannot be determined.

General Ewret had declared this attack hopeless in the very first days of September, after initially requesting its postponement, and instead wanted to attack far in the north, at Wilna, where the enemy was said to be weakened. Under these circumstances, the High Command took the two Guard Corps stationed close to the southern wing from him on September 3. They returned to the Southwestern Front, which now received a slightly more northern target for its 8th Army, Wladimir-Wolynsk. The start of a new general attack by the Southwestern Front was set for September 16. An attempt to perhaps still achieve the cooperation of the southern wing of the Western Front (3rd and Special Army) met with renewed rejection from General Ewret; he had meanwhile suffered a setback on September 9, when he, without the knowledge of the High Command, conducted a partial attack with two corps at Stochod northeast of Kowel, at Rudka-Czerwiszcze.\nMeanwhile, the defeat of the Romanians in the Dobrudja, where Tutrakan had fallen on September 6<sup>3</sup>), prompted King Ferdinand to approach the Tsar on September 8 for more effective support. The Tsar replied that the impending Russian main attack in Galicia represented the most effective assistance currently possible. However, he was also concerned about German attacks in this area and was therefore prepared to send another division (11.5) to the Dobrudja. The fact that the Romanians had to evacuate Silistria on September 9 and the French were also urging did not change his decision.

In this regard, the cooperation can be described as particularly exemplary.\nThe battles of the year 1916 against Russia are to be regarded in their entirety as a major \nand decisive defensive victory for the Central Powers in the East. The loss of territory in \nGalicia and Volhynia had to be accepted. More serious was the considerable loss of \nexperienced fighters. By February 1917, excluding the battles against Romania and in \nMacedonia, it amounted to about 350,000 men for Germany1), approximately 1,000,000 \nmen for Austria-Hungary, and perhaps 200,000 men for Turkey. Against 500,000 prisoners, \nof which not yet 30,000 were Germans, and also about 700 guns had fallen into enemy hands.\nIn contrast, the Russian army is likely to have lost against 1,500,000 men in this one war \nyear, of which more than 100,000 were prisoners, but only a negligibly small number of guns.\nAs a conclusion to the Eastern battles of the year 1916, a front line emerged in connection \nwith the Romanian campaign, which, despite all Russian territorial gains in the Brusilov \nOffensive, ran almost straight from the Black Sea to the Dniester. The enemy still had a \nvery considerable superiority in manpower, and it was quite expected that by spring, \nstrengthened in combat power, they would be ready for new massive assaults.</body>\n<footer>1) This number is calculated according to the \"Sanitary Report on the German Army \nin the World War 1914\u20141918\", 3b.

It is merely a trivial skirmish. There are no signs of larger Russian undertakings.\" However, it was to be assumed that the Russians would continue to use the increased passability of the terrain due to the frost for advances by their raiding commands. On the German side, Field Marshal Prince Leopold of Bavaria at the beginning of the year recognized the good performance of the assault troops trained according to the experiences of the western theater of war in all army groups and emphasized that smaller operations should continue to take place to maintain weapon handling and strengthen confidence in combat superiority over the Russians. Above all, it was important to continuously monitor the organization and condition of the Russian army by capturing prisoners.\nThus, in January and February, the army groups B\u00f6hm-Ermolli, Linsingen, and Woyrsch only engaged in minor skirmishes. In contrast, the Eichhorn army group experienced increased combat activity, especially from the Russian side, around the turn of the year. However, Generaloberst von Eichhorn did not expect larger enemy attacks.\nAt the front of Army Detachment D (formerly Scholtz), on the evening of January 3, companies of the 78th Reserve Division unexpectedly crossed the ice of the Dvina to capture the island of Glaudon, occupied by the Russians, at the mouth; on January 5, it was lost again under Russian counterattack. On January 2 and 4, the Russians unsuccessfully advanced at Lake Mjadziol and Lake Drisviaty, south of Illurt, west of Jacobstadt, and near D\u00fcnhof. On January 5, they engaged in lively artillery activity, particularly between Lake Wiszniew and Lake Narocz and near Postawy, without gaining ground in subsequent advances.

The bent-back flank of the latter army leaned against the Kelemen Mountains, which rise in its eastern part to more than 2100 meters (Petrosul). The Austro-Hungarian XI Corps was attacked here and at Dorna Watra in the last days of September; stronger Romanian forces sought to break into the gap between the two Austro-Hungarian armies in the Maros Valley, so General von Kirchbach had to shift his flank further southwest. General von Seeckt feared, as he reported to the Supreme Command on September 20th*), that if the 1st Army continued to retreat, the 7th would be maneuvered out of its far-advanced position; forces to extend their front were not available. Since the army commands could not provide anything at the moment, Generaloberst von Conrad ordered on October 1st to gather as many forces as the conditions at the front allowed with the 7th Army, to actively intervene in the battle of the 1st Army.\nAt the beginning of October, calm returned to the Carpathian front, not even at Kirlibaba did the enemy continue his attacks. He seemed exhausted after the weeks of fighting, and the weather had become unfavorable and foggy, with snow lying on the heights above 1300 meters.\nOn October 6th, the Supreme Command addressed Generaloberst von Conrad: It seemed that the fighting in the Carpathians would soon come to a \"necessary standstill\" and it would then be possible to withdraw forces. The sooner this happened, the more it would benefit the offensive in Transylvania. General Ludendorff requested information on when a division \u2014 preferably the 117th or 10th Bavarian \u2014 could be withdrawn. Generaloberst von Conrad had already planned the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division for transport. However, the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army reported in agreement with the army group that almost all Russian forces were still positioned in front of the front as before; continuation of their attacks seemed imminent at that point. The division could thus be withdrawn, but only after the front at Kirlibaba had also been locally improved. This was planned for October 14th. Therefore, transport was not expected before the 19th.

Reports from prisoners about disobedience, even mutiny in divisions in the attack area west of Luck, including those of the two Guard Corps, increased. By October 30, the Supreme Command had reports that troops from the previous Russian front had gradually been moved to the new Cavalry Divisions South, in strength of eight to ten corps. At the same time, the period of \"disorganization\" began to become noticeable. Thus, it was possible for the Commander-in-Chief East, due to the high consumption of forces in the West and the needs of the Romanian campaign, to give up his best divisions or exchange them for exhausted or newly formed ones. However, it was first attempted to improve one's own position through smaller operations where necessary.\nThus, on October 30, troops of the 49th Reserve Division of the Gerok Corps (Southern Army) attacked the important heights west of Borowrt Krasnolesie and captured the enemy position in a two-day battle over 1200 meters wide and 400 meters deep. The fight for trench sections lasted a few more days here. The Turkish XV Corps successfully carried out an operation south of Miezhizczow.\nAt the Linsingen Army Group, an attack by the X Army Corps at Witoniez on November 1 was fully successful. Troops of the 121st and 19th Infantry Divisions, in a fresh assault on the western Stochod bank, captured the commanding height 192 and the entire Russian bridgehead; 1600 prisoners and 15 machine guns remained in German hands.\nOn November 9, the Woyrsch Army Group undertook a well-prepared attack to regain positions north of Baranowicze lost in the July battles in the section of the Austro-Hungarian XII Corps. Using flamethrowers, the 5th Reserve and parts of the 201st Infantry Division drove the enemy back four kilometers behind the Strobowa stream and captured over 4400 prisoners, 27 machine guns, and 12 mortars.\nAs the battles with the Gerok Group dragged on, the Supreme Command on November 4 warned that the general situation demanded that \"the goal should not exceed the necessary\n</body>\n", "036": "\n<pageno>369</pageno>\n<header>Southern Army: Eventful Battles.</header>\n<body>Then, however, enemy attack preparations were also detected further south.\nThe Russian attack that began on September 16 hit the left flank of the 3rd Guards Infantry Division, the 1st Reserve Division, and the Turkish XV Corps. At Switelniki, the enemy broke through with strong forces over the Narajowka section; the 1st Reserve Division was pushed back on both sides of the village to the heights, and the Turkish 20th Division lost about two kilometers of ground east of the river. Deployed reserves managed to prevent further enemy advances. In the north, the Turkish 19th Division bravely held its ground, recapturing some lost trenches together with Austro-Hungarian troops in bayonet combat.\nRussian diversionary attacks on the same day against the left flank of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army were already stifled by defensive fire, stronger ones against the right flank of the 2nd Army failed on this and the following day due to the defense of Group Eben.\nOn September 17, the left flank of the 3rd Guards Infantry Division, the 1st Reserve, and the 208th Infantry Division from Group Gerok of the Southern Army launched a counterattack. The heights on both sides of Switelniki and the village itself were largely recaptured. However, a new breakthrough along the railway on the right flank of the Turkish corps was completely offset in fierce combat with the support of the newly arrived 216th Infantry Division. Russian counterattacks, especially against the 1st Reserve Division, were unsuccessful. 3000 prisoners were captured by Group Gerok alone.\nIn eventful battles, only slight progress was made by the Germans on the Narajowka until September 19, but it was not possible to completely drive the enemy back from the west bank. However, as General Count Bothmer reported to the Supreme War Command on September 23\u00b9), this was important for the continued defense of the current front. He had to temporarily halt the attacks here but was determined to resume them after reorganizing the units, consolidating the current positions, and compensating for the losses. The enemy was still \"heavily concentrated\" between Narajowka and Zlota Lipa; aircraft observed troop landings west of Tarnopol.\nMeanwhile, changes had occurred in the organization of the Southern Army: A new German general command had been established on the right flank, the 1st Reserve Division was to be exchanged for the 36th, and the 208th Infantry Division was to be transferred soon; smaller parts</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) p. 23.</footer>\n", "050": "\n<pageno>383</pageno>\n<header>O.

East: Waning of the Battles at Army Group B\u00f6hm-Ermolli.</header>\n<body>The Russians from October 15 to 21 were estimated by the High Command of the Southern Army at at least 35,000 men.\nMeanwhile, on October 20, the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army also joined the High Command East and was assigned to Army Group B\u00f6hm-Ermolli. Thus, a demand that had repeatedly arisen since June of the year, but had not been fulfilled for various reasons, was put into practice: Unity of command was ensured on the entire Eastern Front north of the Carpathians. Only then was it possible to manage with the few reserves without time-consuming negotiations, as required by the needs of the long front that arose here and there.\nWhile combat activity at Army Group Linsingen only temporarily subsided, noticeable calm set in before Army Group B\u00f6hm-Ermolli. By October 28, reports indicated that the Russian II Corps, previously in front of the Southern Army, had been located in the Moldau and that an assault group formed from the southern wing of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had been disbanded again. Thus, the High Command East, as reported by the Supreme Army Command on the 28th, expected at the front of Army Group B\u00f6hm-Ermolli, \"at most only with enemy advances of a demonstrative nature.\"\nAt Army Group Linsingen, the troop concentration in front of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army continued. Business activity soon resumed and occasionally extended to the army groups Litzmann and Bernhardi. On the evening of October 25, the enemy unsuccessfully advanced against the Jatucze-Zubilno section in front of the 20th Infantry Division and then tried to wear it down in the following days with drumfire of the greatest strength. An attack on the morning of the 27th against the left wing of the Austro-Hungarian X Corps was repelled, another broke down the following day in front of the Austrian 13th Infantry Division already in the barrage. On October 29, a Russian mass assault succeeded in a width of one and a half kilometers against the Bedmann group west of Pustomyty, partially reaching the wire obstacles, as well as in the evening on the northern wing of the Szurmay Corps near Szelwow.\nAlso in front of the center of Army Group Woyrsch, the enemy was more active. From October 25 to 27, he launched gas attacks against the 4th Landwehr and 201st Infantry Division, which, however, had almost no effect. The subsequent battles lasted into November.</body>\n<footer>1) See p. 360; previous events at the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army p. 363 ff.</footer>\n", "024": "\n<pageno>357</pageno>\n<header>Austro-Hungarian 7th Army: Heavy Defensive Battles.</header>\n<body>The right wing of the Sur\u00e9n Corps lost the Smotrec, rising to 1896 meters, on the evening of September 18. But also on the right wing of the army, combat activity increased; Russian and Romanian units advanced against the flank bent back southwest of Dorna Watra. The army was in a difficult situation as it no longer had significant reserves.\nNorth of Kirlibaba, reinforcement of the brave Hungarian 40th Infantry Division became urgent, which had suffered considerable losses in the steadfast defense, especially at the 1661-meter-high mountain block of Capul (five kilometers south of Magura). Two German battalions and artillery were deployed with it. But the 200th Infantry Division was also in a serious situation. On September 19, General von Conta had to point out that they had been fighting against superior Russian forces for weeks: \"The advantageous troop is fully up to their mass attacks, but due to exhaustion and overexertion, it can no longer hold out, as the Russians, with their constantly fresh reserves, give them no time to rest.\" The reserves were constantly on counterattacks, and he had no more for the 200th Infantry Division; their long lines were untenable under these circumstances in the long run. The 1st Infantry Division also had only limited combat strength. General von Conta requested the supply of reserves and labor to expand the Carpathian ridge, which must be held as a permanent position for the winter, for sustainable defense.\nOn the same day, General Ludendorff learned from Major General von Seeckt's morning report about the condition of the 200th Infantry Division. He asked Generaloberst von Conrad, who wanted to deploy the Hungarian 202nd Infantry Brigade at Kirlibaba, to assign it to the 200th Infantry Division, as he considered the situation there more serious. Generaloberst von Conrad, however, believed he could not do without the brigade's deployment to the right wing, as the Russians had already approached within four kilometers of the road in the valley of the Golden Bistritz, but he agreed to the request upon repetition by Field Marshal von Hindenburg to assign the regiment of the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division, located with the Austro-Hungarian XI Corps, to the Carpathian Corps as soon as the Austro-Hungarian 59th Infantry Division had arrived there.\nOn September 20, new enemy attacks began, only at Kulfal and Jablonica Pass it remained quiet. While the Austro-Hungarian XI Corps</body>\n", "055": "\n<pageno>388</pageno>\n<header>The Battles on the Russian Front: Brusilov Offensive.</header>\n<body>and troop movements were especially a heavy obstacle on the Roman\u2014Bacau route. The sea route was used until the moment the Central Powers' troops took possession of the unloading points, without the Turkish fleet or German submarines being able to prevent it.\nThe defeat of the Romanians at Hermannstadt on September 28 made the situation appear quite serious, although the Romanian Northern Army, albeit with only weak forces, still stood on the mountains west of the upper Maros and Alt valleys. General Alexeyev feared the assembly of a strong enemy strike army in Transylvania, which could push back these Romanian troops and break through over the mountains to the east towards the Danube estuary; in conjunction with the enemy offensive in Dobruja, the Romanians could then be cut off from Russia, opening the way to Bessarabia and southern Russia to the enemy. The Russian Chief of General Staff therefore urged the Romanian military leadership to assemble their main forces in the area north of Hermannstadt. He also recommended, in any case, the construction of a strong defensive position along the line Dorna Watra\u2014Kronstadt\u2014Bucharest\u2014lower Danube. On their own fronts, the intended new attacks by the 7th and 9th Armies had not yet begun. It was again explicitly determined that all major operations north of the Rokitno Swamps should be avoided; the focus should finally be shifted to the southern flank of the entire front to the 9th Army. The attack on Vladimir-Volynsk was also to be stopped, the left wing of the 9th was to be extended from the 8th and Special Army, and the High Command 8 was to be inserted between the 7th and 9th Armies. For the fight against Bulgaria, which General Joffre described as the most important, the North and West Fronts were to send one to two corps into Dobruja. On the other hand, General Alexeyev demanded from the French military leadership) renewed reinforcement of the Salonika Army by troops of the Western Powers, including Italy and Portugal, and suggested that Japan should also be induced to send at least one corps for the war in Europe.\nHowever, the shift of focus to the 9th Army was partly questioned again because General Brusilov still did not consider it right to launch the attack that had just been prepared again</body>\n<footer>1) Marine Archive: \"The War at Sea 1914\u201418.

On October 20, the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army also joined the B\u00f6hm-Ermolli Army Group. Due to seniority reasons, the leaders of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, Generaloberst K\u00f6vess von K\u00f6vessh\u00e1za, and the 7th Army, General von Kirchbach, were changed. The High Command of the Army Front Archduke Karl was moved on the 24th to Klausenburg, thus closer to its main combat front now directed against Romania. At this time, General von Seeckt assessed the situation in front of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army as such that the newly assigned Russian 8th Army, which had taken over the sector from Kirlibaba to Bystrzyca Nadwornia\u0144ska, had a defensive mission, while the Russian 9th Army, together with the Romanian Northern Army, could become offensive, and indeed \"the more energetically, the further south,\" as they could \"lead the thrust into Transylvania against the flank and rear of the German 9th Army.\" Its southern wing was to connect with the Romanian Northern Army in the area of the T\u00f6lgyes Pass. Archduke Karl therefore recommended active behavior to his armies to identify and bind enemy forces. The demarcation between the Austro-Hungarian 1st and 7th Armies was newly regulated. After the Austro-Hungarian XI Corps temporarily transferred from the 7th to the 1st Army on October 7, thereby taking responsibility for the area almost devoid of troops between the valleys of the Maros and the Golden Bistritz, the Kelener Mountains were now determined as the boundary; the Austro-Hungarian XI Corps returned to the 7th Army, connecting north of Palota to the left wing of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army).</body>\n<body>On October 27, General Ludendorff wrote to General von Seeckt that he no longer expected an attack by the Russians in the Carpathians. Generaloberst von Conrad shared this view.</body>\n<body>In the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, the 2nd Cyclist Brigade was replaced by Austrian Landsturm, and at the beginning of November, despite the concerns of the army commander, the rest of the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division was also withdrawn. While the rest of the army's front mostly remained calm, combat activity at the Austro-Hungarian XI Corps, in connection with the battles of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, repeatedly flared up due to mutual local offensive operations. Bavarian and Hungarian battalions captured 538 Russians east of Dorna Watra on October 27, in addition to gaining ground.</body>\n<body>After a four-week pause, the enemy launched another attack from November 28 as part of a broad relief offensive for the Romanian front, almost along the entire front of the 7th Army, and achieved</body>\n", "025": "\n<pageno>358</pageno>\n<header>The Battles on the Russian Front: Brusilov Offensive.</header>\n<body>While defending against Romanian-Russian attacks at the Kelemen Mountains north of Dorna Watra, the enemy advanced southeast of Kirlibaba into the valley of the Golden Bistritz. At the Ludowa Front, he finally broke through in several places during the sixth attack conducted in dense masses. Although the heroic defenders of the 200th Division under Major General Boe\u00df managed to repel him once with hand grenades and bayonets, the western summit of Baba Ludowa was lost for good the following day. The front now ran three kilometers further back. A setback also occurred on the left flank of the army, in the area of the Pantyr Pass, and the front had to be withdrawn to the pass height. The army group was forced to send, in addition to the already arrived Austro-Hungarian 30th, the Austro-Hungarian 12th Infantry Division, intended for the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, coming from the Southern Army. A German Landsturm regiment coming from the Southern Army was also designated to reinforce the 200th Infantry Division.\nMeanwhile, business activity, hindered by rain, snow, and fog, gradually subsided along the entire line. The attacker seemed to tire after the extremely costly battles of the last few days. After the Austro-Hungarian 59th Infantry Division arrived at Kirlibaba on September 23, General von Seeckt considered the situation there improved. Although the enemy launched new fierce offensives against the Austro-Hungarian troops of the Austro-Hungarian Corps and especially further north against the 200th Infantry Division in the following days, he achieved no significant successes. September 25 was \"the hardest day of fighting so far\" for the J\u00e4ger regiments of the 200th Division; the assault by about three enemy divisions \"with numerous heavy artillery\" failed to break through their over 34-kilometer-long front. On the 29th, they captured 500 prisoners in a counterattack. Then peace returned here\u00b9). In view of the new heavy losses of the division (3500 men since August 28), it was high time that the Carpathian Corps finally received further German reinforcements, including the cyclist brigade and further parts of the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division, which was now almost entirely united here.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) War Diary of the 200th I.

He threatened again to lay his hand on the Borsa\u2014Kirlibaba road. The High Command of the Army Front diverted a regiment from the 49th Reserve Division, which was encircling the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, to that location. On November 30, the enemy achieved another success against the left wing of the army, where he dangerously approached the Jablonica Pass: \"Only to use Gin\u00e1z halfway, with rifle shots from our men\") it was possible to prevent the strong forces, which had advanced over a kilometer wide, from further advancing. Chief of Staff Baron von Richthofen, who had taken command from General Cser\u00e9n a few days earlier, requested help as he had no more reserves. The army and army group were unable to assist. However, the importance of this mountain crossing prompted the Supreme War Command to agree to the deployment of another regiment of the 49th Reserve Division there.\nIn further heavy attacks, especially again in the area on both sides of the Ludowa, the enemy was mostly repelled and suffered extraordinarily high losses in some places; minor breaches were soon compensated. From November 28 to December 1, the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army lost more than 4000 men, half of them missing. The enemy's losses, on the other hand, are estimated to be \"after very cautious estimation\" 11,000 men; more than 1200 prisoners were taken.\nOn December 1, the 1st Infantry Division recaptured the lost high position north of the Prislop Saddle in a counterattack and took over 1000 prisoners. By December 5, the enemy was also driven out of the breach south of the Jablonica Pass. At Kirlibaba and north of Jakobeny, the situation had somewhat improved in the meantime. When the fighting temporarily subsided, the army front ordered the evacuation of the 49th Reserve Division to the 1st Army on December 8, which, however, could only be carried out gradually due to the tense situation at Jakobeny. The Russians had advanced so far here and had a narrow view into the Bistritz Valley, making traffic there extremely difficult. A counterattack failed due to a lack of forces. From December 21, the Hungarian 51st Infantry Division was expected as reinforcement.

In unconditional willingness to help, the German Supreme Army Command supplied the Austro-Hungarian front sections with forces that could only just be made available. This has not only been gratefully acknowledged by the ally, but he has also \u2014 especially since Field Marshal von Hindenburg and General Ludendorff took over overall command \u2014 willingly complied with all measures deemed necessary by the Germans for defense. This often meant selfless renunciation for the army of the Danube monarchy and its leaders, which they bore for the good of the common cause, but which certainly was not easy for them. For all those measures and interventions emanating from the German side \u2014 justified as they were by the circumstances \u2014 nevertheless brought an influence on the Austro-Hungarian armed forces that extended far beyond the operational level into the realm of small tactics, indeed into the training and internal structure of the army\u00b9). As an example, it may be mentioned that at the focal points of the fighting, individual German battalions were often inserted as supports for the defense into the Austro-Hungarian front or held ready for counterattack just behind it, without the local Austro-Hungarian commander having direct disposal rights over them, as this remained expressly with the German command posts. Such regulation was certainly not exemplary, but under the given circumstances, it was hardly avoidable. That there were occasional frictions when mixing troops and overlapping command authorities was inevitable. It had to be accepted in order to secure success in the face of the common danger by mobilizing all forces.\nTrusting in the measures taken, the unconditional will to resist to the utmost of all German sub-commanders and their troops, the new Supreme Army Command has been able to watch the heavy defensive battles with increasing confidence and even withdraw parts from the already so sparsely manned Eastern Front for urgent needs elsewhere.

He eventually managed to gain the approval of the military command for this; for it was clear that any weakening of one's own front and the cessation of the attack at this point would also free up corresponding forces of the enemy, who, thanks to strong railway connections, could bring them back into action at another point sooner than oneself. Only after the execution of the attack by the Special Army, which began on October 16, did General Brussilow want to send more forces south. Nevertheless, after the Romanians were pushed back across the border at Kronstadt on October 8, three and a half corps rolled there alongside the high command of the 8th Army, two of which went to the 9th Army and extended their southern flank to Ol.-Toplicza, one and a half (one of which was initially destined for Moldavia to Piatra) into the Dobrudscha.\nWhen the attack attempted by General Gurko towards Wladimir-Wolynsk by the Special Army again failed with heavy losses, General Brussilow wanted to repeat it on October 23/24. However, he had to finally abandon his intentions, as the military command took away another corps from him. In the southern adjoining armies (11th and 7th), the attacks were stopped around the same time without having achieved significant results, only in the 9th Army were they continued in connection with the battles of the Romanians. By the end of October, the \"Brussilow Offensive\" was over.\nThe focus of Russian warfare was now clearly on the Romanian front. The initial goal was Albochy. After the Romanians were pushed back from Transylvania everywhere to the border mountains and in the Dobrudscha beyond the Constanza\u2014Cernavoda railway during October, there was nothing left but to bring them help as much as possible. Above all, more corps had to be freed to fill the gap that had formed between the 9th and the Romanian Northern Army due to the withdrawal of Romanian troops to Wallachia, and to reinforce the Dobrudscha Army. Later, it was hoped to be able to go on the offensive at both points.

The losses of the Russians were heavy, including 1100 prisoners. However, the defenders also suffered significant losses; the German battalions inserted into the Austro-Hungarian front and thrown into battle as reserves suffered considerably in defense and counterattacks.\nThe Commander-in-Chief East had allocated the majority of his reserves to the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army and Army Group Linsingen, leaving him with only a few battalions at his disposal. To create new reserves, he could only withdraw individual regiments. Despite considerable previous allocations, he withdrew two more regiments from Army Group Gronau and Army Group Woyrsch to Brest Litowsk, one from the front at Mitau to Grodno. There, the attack expected by Colonel General von Eichhorn had not yet occurred, but reserves had to be kept ready due to the strong Russian troop concentration. Greater concern was caused by the situation on the extreme southern flank, which was affected by the breach on the northern flank of the Southern Army. At the request of the Supreme Army Command, which pointed out the very serious situation of the Southern Army on the night of September 3, he withdrew five battalions and three batteries from his limited reserves behind the right flank of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army.\nThe situation remained tense for Army Group Linsingen. Against their Army Group Bernhardi, the enemy continued their approach work vigorously. On September 4, aircraft detected the transport of forces on the railway leading from Sarny. Colonel General von Linsingen expected an attack at this location. The Supreme Army Command then issued a new demand to immediately withdraw the necessary units, especially infantry, from the front to form three new divisions (216th to 218th). For this, Army Group Eichhorn had to provide four, Army Group Woyrsch, Army Group Linsingen, and 38 regiments. Additionally, by September 6, the 89th Infantry Division of Army Group Woyrsch and the Hungarian 37th Infantry Division of Army Group Linsingen were to be transferred to Transylvania. In the future, regiments or even battalions would have to suffice to avert urgent danger at their own front or to restore the situation.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) In total, since the end of August, the following were to be transferred: Gen.

From the Rokitno Swamps to the Baltic Sea, the front was firmly established in the\nlines taken more than a year ago. The battles in Romania\nhad significantly weakened the Russian overall army. There were no signs of\nlarger undertakings.\nThe Supreme Command wanted to switch to pure defense on the entire Eastern Front\nand therefore withdraw forces from all sections,\nat the Mackensen Army Group, as soon as \"a defensible\npermanent and corresponding strategic defensive position in\nEast Wallachia\" was established. It had informed the Austro-Hungarian Army\nCommand on December 30, 1916, that at the Archduke Josef Army Front,\na number of German divisions would have to be gradually replaced and withdrawn by\nAustro-Hungarian forces, partly taken from the front of the Supreme Commander East.\nI.

The right wing of the 7th Army at Dorna Watra was bent back southwestward along the Romanian border by deploying the Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division. Behind this wing, the Hungarian 5th Cavalry Division and the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division were brought up by the 3rd Army, although the deployment of the latter with the 1st Army remained intended.\nMeanwhile, in the last days of August, the enemy pushed the front on both sides of the Bystrzyca Nadwornia\u0144ska Valley back towards the Pantyr Pass, so that the German cyclist brigade, which had just been released as an army reserve, had to be brought there. South of the Jablonica Pass, the 117th Infantry Division under Major General Seydel recaptured the ridge west of Kukul and the mountain itself in a storm on August 30.\nWhen on August 31 strong Russian attacks against the Southern Army\u00b9) and the right wing of the Commander-in-Chief East\u00b2) began, new attacks were launched against the Austro-Hungarian XI Corps and the Carpathian Corps at the 7th Army. The entire 10th Bavarian Infantry Division, for which the German Supreme Army Command had also reserved the right of disposal, was forwarded to Be\u0142zcerzce. To get his own reserves into hand and to prevent impending encirclement, General von Conta, with the approval of the army commander, withdrew the 200th Infantry Division, which was standing in an advancing arc, on September 1 into the position up to eight kilometers back on the ridge on both sides of the Ludowa. Meanwhile, the 1st Infantry Division under Major General Paschen had to fend off heavy attacks. At the same time, the situation on the right wing of the army intensified. North of Jab\u0142oncy, the enemy had broken into the position. Riflemen of the Hungarian 5th Cavalry Division and the foremost battalion of the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division were hastily drawn there. Also on the flank of the Austro-Hungarian XI Corps near and southwest of Dorna Watra, the enemy became more active. The only connecting road leading through the Godowenen Bystritz Valley to the right wing of the army seemed threatened, so that General von Seeckt reported to the Supreme Army Command on September 2, considering the release of further parts of the 10th Bavarian Division necessary.

The intensity \nof the attacks, especially in the Jaturce\u2014Zubilin section, where the latter division \nrepelled the Russian infantry storming perhaps ten times during the night of October 16 and throughout the day, \nshowed that the enemy was serious about these attacks; this was also evidenced by the noticeable increase \nin their air forces. The particularly systematic deployment for reconnaissance \nand combat led to the assumption that these were French air \nunits). However, Combat Squadron 2 was just about to be transferred \nto the west. In three days of fighting, the enemy suffered a new heavy defeat from October 14 to 16. \nNorth of the attack section, however, on October 18 at dawn, \ntroops of the 19th Infantry Division launched an attack after gas releases, \ntook the Russian position on both sides of Julianowka over a width of about two \nkilometers, and cleared the western Stochod bank.\nMeanwhile, the enemy at the Southern Army had once again \ngathered strength.

Against the B\u0153dmann group and the southern flank of the Szurmay Corps, the freshly replenished two Guard Corps stormed no less than 17 times, but the attacks of the Russian XXXIV and X Corps as well as the Russian XXV against the Austro-Hungarian division were hardly less intense. According to prisoners, the aim was to break through to Wladimir-Wolynsk at all costs on that day. However, the attacks failed with unusually bloody losses. Where the enemy infantry reached the completely leveled trenches at certain points, they were soon repelled in a counterattack, and the enemy sought to advance again through artillery fire on their own trenches. In total, troops from eleven Russian divisions were identified. The continuation of the attacks on the following two days was equally unsuccessful, although it was hoped to inflict significant losses on the defenders. On October 5, the enemy ceased their efforts.

The best defense against an attack on the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, the General saw in the own advance of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army; the army group was still considering whether the forces would suffice for this; they intended to initially assign the Hungarian 39th Infantry Division from the Southern Army to the 7th Army. The Southern Army would be reinforced from the army group reserves in case of emergency. For sudden occurrences, three Russian divisions were ready near the railways. The expansion of the route in question for their deployment from Kalusz via Stryj\u2014Marmaros Sziget to K\u00f6r\u00f6smez\u00f6 or Borsa would be operated by Austro-Hungarian and German railway troops.</body>\n<header>2.

East: Confident View of the Situation.</header>\n<body>\nOn the side of the Central Powers, a significant defensive success was achieved, although their own losses were not insignificant. The constant attacks of the Russians, whose considerable numerical superiority allowed them to strike at widely separated points of the long front with strong masses or to simultaneously attempt breakthroughs at several points, repeatedly made it necessary to rapidly deploy reserves that had barely been taken in hand, thereby mixing the units in a highly undesirable manner. The commander-in-chief hoped that the now likely pause in fighting and the soon-to-be-expected impassability of the Russian early winter would finally provide the opportunity to obtain significant reserves at a central location and to carry out the always closely monitored order of the units. The reserves would then be ready to counter any renewed mass attack against their own front or to intervene at other decisive points.\nGeneral Ludendorff urged that the 49th Reserve Division be united at Lemberg as soon as possible; it was important to free up forces to \"make the offensive in Transylvania truly decisive.\" On October 6, the commander-in-chief East consequently withdrew the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division from the front of the Bernhardi group, which the enemy had weakened.\nOn October 8, the Russians again attacked the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army\u00b9) of the Linsingen Army Group, again unsuccessfully. The most heavily hit 20th Infantry Division repelled all attacks from two Russian divisions, and by October 10, calm had returned. Within the army group, the view gained ground that major attacks were no longer to be expected. But on October 12, General von der Marwitz suggested that a new attack was indeed imminent. The commander-in-chief East had meanwhile transferred six Austro-Hungarian battalions from the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army and the Litzmann Group to the Isonzo front, as it was necessary to \"counter the impending loss of Trieste as quickly as possible\"; on October 14, he had five Austro-Hungarian heavy batteries follow.\n</body>\n<footer>\n\u00b9) The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army was now organized according to various reports into: 2nd and 3rd Austro-Hungarian Infantry Divisions with Group Tscherman (108th and 115th Infantry Divisions, including 2nd Cavalry Brigade), Szurmay Corps (section of General von Rundel, Austro-Hungarian 11th Infantry Division, 10th Austro-Hungarian Division, \u00bd/75th Reserve Division), Austro-Hungarian X Corps (frequent 13th and Austro-Hungarian 2nd Infantry Divisions), Bgrft. X A. R. (General Schmidt von Knobelsdorf) with 20th, 19th, 121st Infantry Divisions, 5th and 9th Austro-Hungarian Infantry Divisions.\nParticularly in the Marwitz Army Group, German troops were still distributed among the Austro-Hungarian troops.\n</footer>\n", "068": "\n<pageno>401</pageno>\n<header>D. 23.

Further attacks were expected. General von Eichhorn had nine battalions and artillery brought in, but their transport was delayed by snow drifts.\nIn the early morning of January 7, new Russian attacks collapsed on the Riga\u2014Mitau railway, while during the night the enemy had penetrated several batteries in the dunes west of the Mangalzer Break, 32 guns had fallen into his hands. By swinging north, he also wanted to take on the still-standing battalions. Only at the forest edges of the western Aa bank did the disordered remnants of the German position garrison regroup for new resistance. Parts of the 2nd Infantry Division, temporarily made available by the Supreme Army Command and intended for transport to the west, restored the artillery assembly point southwest of the Mangalzer Break to the Aa. But the position front, which protruded far north of the river, was abandoned in the afternoon under enemy pressure and withdrawn to the same level as on the east bank.\nTo relieve the Mitau group, its command area was limited on January 8 to the attack section between the Mitau\u2014Riga road and the Tirul swamp west of the Aa. The Supreme Army Command completely freed the 2nd Infantry Division. It was to be deployed on both sides of the Aa to quickly establish a truly defensible front here. Against this, the Russians attacked in vain in the early morning of January 9 near and east of Kaltzem.\nThus, the defensive battle at the Aa came to an end. For several days and nights, German troops, mostly of second and third order, had withstood continuous fighting in biting cold, in deep snow, only passable swamp land due to frost, without any accommodation and with only inadequately feasible supplies, absorbing the significantly superior assault. Instead of the desired operational breakthrough to Mitau, the enemy only managed a bulge in the front. German losses amounted to 3,500 men, while the Russians were estimated at 23,000 men.</body>\n<header>The German Counterattack.</header>\n<body>On January 9, a Russian order was brought in, in which General Radko Dimitrijew said: \"The victory is indeed great, but not yet</body>\n", "105": "\n<pageno>2</pageno>\n<header>Appendix 7.

The Army Group leader, General of Cavalry Archduke-Heir Karl Franz Josef, was advised by the German Major General von Seeckt as Chief of Staff; the Archduke followed him \"willingly in all matters of leadership\"(2). The Army Group was required to report to both army commands simultaneously according to a decision made on July 1.\nSubordinated to the German Supreme Army Command:\nFront of the Commander-in-Chief East, since September 1 under Field Marshal Prince Leopold of Bavaria, with the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army under Colonel General von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli, further the Army Groups Linsingen, Woyrsch (formerly Prince Leopold) and Eichhorn, a total of 82 infantry divisions (22\u00bd of which were Austro-Hungarian).

Here, the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army joined. Generaloberst von Pflanzer-Baltin had over seven infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions, including German troops of the 1st and 200th Infantry Divisions as well as the 2nd Cyclist Brigade, and newly arrived, the 117th Infantry Division, heavily weakened after several weeks of deployment at the Somme. The front was divided into Austro-Hungarian XI Corps, German Carpathian Corps, Austro-Hungarian I Corps1).\nBy the end of August, the situation2) had somewhat eased following the attack successes of the Carpathian Corps under Lieutenant General von Conta. The least secure seemed to be at the Jablonica Pass, where the Russians had taken the Kukul rising to 1540 meters and the western forelying border ridge on August 19. By deploying the 117th Infantry Division behind this section to K\u00f6r\u00f6smezo, the worst concern was initially alleviated. As the enemy simultaneously reinforced in front of the right army wing, countermeasures were also necessary there. The idea of relieving the army through an offensive by the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army had to be abandoned when, on August 27, General von Falkenhayn reported that the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division, held in reserve behind this army, was intended for Romania and was only to be deployed with Army Group Archduke Karl in urgent emergencies, and furthermore, that \"the assignment of further German troops for the foreseeable future given the situation in the West and with Army Group Hindenburg is impossible.\" The army group was to \"limit itself to holding its positions by all means and keep its reserves ready for possible use on other fronts.\"\nAfter Romania's declaration of war (August 27), the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army left Army Group Archduke Karl and was assigned to</body>\n<footer>1) Organization: Austro-Hungarian XI Corps (Hungarian 11th and Austro-Hungarian 8th R.

East: End of the Winter Battle on the Aa.</header>\n<body>The remaining forces reorganized the front for defense. More than the combat activity of the vastly superior enemy, the winter weather in March had worn down the troops, although, based on the experiences of the first defensive battles, everything possible had been done to protect them. They had also defied the hardships of the Russian winter in an incomparable manner. The solidity of the Eastern Front had also proven unshakeable in this section of the front, temporarily particularly endangered by the frost period.</body>\n<header>D. The Outcome of the War Year 1916 in the East\u00b9).</header>\n<body>With the cessation of the Brusilov Offensive, one of the most severe crises of the Eastern War was overcome. The further immediate support of the collapsing Romanian army by Russia already bore a defensive character. The Russian attack at Mitau, which followed in January 1917, had only local objectives. In terms of the number of fighters deployed, as well as space and time, the major Russian spring and summer offensives of 1916 belong to the most formidable undertakings of the war. Initially conceived and prepared as a decisive operation against the German part of the Eastern Front, they ended as a campaign against Austria-Hungary. After the first attack, undertaken in March to relieve the French attacked at Verdun, was stifled in German defensive fire and in the swamp of the snowmelt at Lake Narocz, Italy's distress in Tyrol led to a new relief attack at the beginning of June, a month before the time for the planned start of the major offensive had come. This attack, directed against the Austro-Hungarian part of the front, was initially supposed to represent only a side operation. Instead, unexpectedly large successes and a lack of confidence in the success of a further postponed main attack north of the Rokitno Swamps soon led to a gradual shift and finally to the deliberate relocation of the focus of operations to the front south of the swamps. Against Austria-Hungary, the persistent will to attack and the confidence in victory of General Brusilov drove the Russian troops forward again and again for five full months, initially with good success, since the support of the front by hastily arriving German divisions without operationally significant further results.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Cf. p. 392 ff.</footer>\n", "021": "\n<pageno>354</pageno>\n<header>The Battles on the Russian Front: Brusilov Offensive.</header>\n<body>further battalions agreed to go there. But parts of the division also had to be sent behind the front at the Jablonica Pass, as despite the deployment of the last local reserves, the allied troops fighting north of the pass could only hold their ground with difficulty. The newly assumed command of the XXV Reserve Corps, Lieutenant General Sur\u00e9n, was to take over leadership in this threatened section. A German Landsturm regiment, standing ready behind the equally attacked Southern Army, was assigned to the 7th Army. The army group was justifiably concerned about further developments on their front, as all reserves were exhausted and the Russian attacks seemed to continue.\nFrom the evening of September 4, heavy attacks by three Russian divisions began against the Carpathian Corps. At the 200th Infantry Division, the enemy broke through with multiple superiority east of the Smotrec into the weakly occupied lines of their three J\u00e4ger regiments despite the bravest resistance, and the battle-tested 1st Infantry Division also found itself in a serious situation in the area of Kruhla Ricerka. Generaloberst von Pflanzer had meanwhile sent a Hungarian infantry regiment for reinforcement, and the Supreme Army Command approved the immediate deployment of the still available parts of the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division via Marmaros Sziget.\nIn the war diary of the army group, it is stated on September 6: \"The events of the last few days make it increasingly clear that the Russians are determined to do everything with strong forces to cross the Carpathians. A further reinforcement of the 7th Army, despite the deployment of the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division, is therefore urgently desired.\" The situation appeared even more threatening due to the advance of the Romanians into the upper Maros Valley; this had to affect the right flank and the rear connections of the army group, unless the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army succeeded in stopping it. On the right wing of the army at the Austro-Hungarian XI Corps, there was fierce fighting. The Carpathian Corps had to endure further heavy battles. Southeast of Baba Ludowa, four Russian mass attacks failed on September 6; on September 7, the enemy succeeded in breaking through with a Honved regiment deployed on the left flank of the 1st Infantry Division and expanding the breach the following day; a German battery was lost. A regiment and artillery of the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division arriving at Borsa on the 8th came just in time to close the gap in the middle of the Carpathian Corps and stop the breach.</body>\n<footer>*) p. 218.</footer>\n", "086": "\n<pageno>528</pageno>\n<header>Directory of Persons.</header>\n<body>\nCount von Schmettow (Eberhard), Lt.

The Commander-in-Chief East, however, considered the transfer of individual regiments only possible when \"the Russian offensive had been repelled or the tactical situation allowed it.\" He could initially only offer a few cavalry brigades.\nMeanwhile, on October 5, the Southern Army was combined with the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army into the army group of Generaloberst von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli, who retained command over this army, and was subordinated to the Commander-in-Chief East1). The Austro-Hungarian IX Corps moved from the Southern Army to the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army to consolidate command on and around the Tarnopol\u2014Alcazow road and railway. Around the same time (October 3), changes also occurred on the northern flank of the Commander-in-Chief East: As General of Infantry Otto von Below went to the Balkans2), General of Infantry von Fabeck, and when he soon fell ill, General of Infantry von Mudra became Commander-in-Chief of the 8th Army. General of Infantry Freiherr von Scheffer-Boyadel took over the former 12th Army as \"Army Detachment Scheffer.\"\nEven though in these days the enemy again advanced against the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, and soon after with strong forces against the center of the Southern Army, and the fighting at the Linsingen Army Group had not yet ceased, the Commander-in-Chief East considered the worst crises to be overcome. In a memorandum dated October 4, intended as a basis for the presentation to the Kaiser, who was staying with the Linsingen Army Group in Kowel on the evening of October 5, he outlined the development of operations since the end of July and expressed his view of the current situation as follows: Decisive Russian attacks against the Eichhorn and Woyrsch army groups were not to be expected for the time being, as they would require extensive, time-consuming regroupings of enemy forces. Attempts to break through at the Linsingen Army Group and the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army might not yet be completely abandoned, but it was expected that after the recent enormous losses of the enemy, a longer pause would soon occur. Renewed probing of the front by the enemy for weak spots was anticipated.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 360; previous events at the Southern Army p. 363 ff.\n2) p. 340.</footer>\n", "034": "\n<pageno>367</pageno>\n<header>Southern Army: Evasion from Superior Attack.</header>\n<body>\nThe rearguards left behind by Group Gerok in the intermediate terrain had to retreat before the sharply advancing enemy, estimated at eight to nine divisions from the Dniester to north of Zawalow, to the main position by the evening of September 6. The 3rd Guard Infantry Division, which had meanwhile arrived, was to relieve the heavily worn 105th Infantry Division.\nAlong with new attacks threatening the Carpathian Front, the Russian concentration of forces also indicated the continuation of attacks with the aim of breaking through between the Austro-Hungarian 3rd and Southern Army. The Supreme Army Command also transferred the 208th Infantry Division, intended for Transylvania, to the Southern Army and instructed that the newly formed 105th Infantry Division be moved from September 6 in exchange with the 105th Infantry Division behind the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army. Field Marshal von Hindenburg instructed General von Seeckt to inform the German senior leaders: The Kaiser expects the Southern and 3rd Army to hold their positions. The German reserves should be positioned as close as possible behind the business front, otherwise they would arrive too late! The German Chief of Staff addressed Generaloberst von Conrad with the request to influence the Army Group Archduke Karl in the same way; any operation south of the Carpathians was excluded if the front north of it was not secure. The supply of the allied empires would also require the possession of the oil sources in Galicia west of the current position near Drohobycz.\nEven before he had advanced into storm positions, the enemy attacked with particular intensity on the Dniester from September 7 to 9, apparently with the aim of taking Halicz and breaking through north of the river to Bursztyn. The attacks, which extended northward over a width of 40 kilometers to the Turkish XV Corps, completely collapsed under extraordinarily high losses, which were estimated at \"approximately 25,000 men.\" 13,000 men, 11 machine guns remained in the hands of the defenders, with parts of the 3rd Guard Infantry Division already participating since September 8.

Finally, \nthe attack, in which the 8th Army, now formed to the right of the 9th, \nwas also to participate, was set for November 28; the fact that \nin the meantime, on November 23, the Mackensen Army Group crossed the \nDanube south of Bucharest made it more urgent than ever. In doing so, \nthe Russian military leadership saw the best solution in the gradual withdrawal \nof the Romanians, in order to at least preserve the fighting strength of their army. In \nthis sense, General Beljajew, who was sent to Bucharest as a military envoy \nand was previously the head of the deputy general staff, tried to \nact, but understandably could not prevail against the \nRomanian leadership, which did not want to surrender the capital and lower Wallachia \nto the enemy without a fight and was supported in this by the French military envoy, \nGeneral Berthelot. The French urged \nhelping the Romanians at Bucharest. Thus, the attack of the Russian \n8th and 9th Armies actually began on November 28.\nDuring these days, there was a change in military leadership. For \nthe seriously ill General Alexeyev, General \nGurko, previously commander-in-chief of the Special Army, took over \nthe duties of chief of staff on November 23. However, the decision on all \nimportant issues remained with General Alexeyev, with whom constant \ncommunication was maintained. The 4th Army, forming just north of Focsani, \nand on December 1, the Danube Army \nwere subordinated to General Brusilov. On the other hand, the intended \nand urgently needed direct influence on the leadership \nof the Romanian army could not be achieved, as under King Ferdinand \nit accepted the fight far ahead of the Russian front at Bucharest.\nWhen, after December 3, the Romanians had to evacuate their capital \nand retreat to the northeast, while the attack of the Russian \n8th and 9th Armies brought only minor local successes, it became increasingly \ndisruptive that a unified command of the Russian and Romanian \noperations had not yet been achieved; General Brusilov complained that \nhe was not informed about King Ferdinand's wishes. Thus, \nby order of the Tsar on December 7, a new army group \"South\" was formed from the remnants of the Romanian \narmy, the 4th and the Danube (future 6th) Army, under King Ferdinand of Romania as \ncommander-in-chief with General Sakharov as chief of staff1). \nIn view of the slow arrival \nof all reinforcements and the successes of the Central Powers, the Russian military leadership \nwas left with only defense and retreat to manage for the time being.</body>\n", "093": "\n<pageno>535</pageno>\n<header>Troop Directory.</header>\n<body>\n212.

Thus, the enemy initially ceased his attacks at this point, but activity remained brisk.\nMuch heavier than the Russian assault in the north was the one in the south. Here, on August 31, the Russians attacked the Austro-Hungarian XIII and VI Corps and the northern adjoining 1st Reserve Division over a width of 20 kilometers with five divisions\u00b9). The positions of the two Austro-Hungarian corps were breached, so it was not possible to restore the situation. General Count von Bothmer had to decide to withdraw the troops about four kilometers. The German 105th Infantry Division, which was exhausted behind the front, was made available by the army group and inserted between the two very depleted Austro-Hungarian corps. Since only the extreme northern wing of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army was attacked and the situation here seemed secure, the army group brought the 199th Infantry Division from there to Halicz the following day and provided a mixed detachment from it to support the right wing and hold the important Magja height, which dominates the Dniester Valley south of Halicz, for the Southern Army. General of Infantry von Gerok, previously with the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, took command of this wing up to and including the 1st Reserve Division.\nThe position retaken by the Gerok group was only weakly fortified; its garrison, which consisted predominantly of German troops, was thin to the \"extremely permissible extent.\" On the morning of September 1, the Russians attacked the southern section, especially the Magja height, in vain, and on the 2nd, the center of the army, the Austro-Hungarian Hofmann Corps, whose front southwest of Brzezany was penetrated on the 3rd. \"The successes of the Russians in recent times\" \u2014 as stated in the war diary of the army group on September 4 \u2014 \"are primarily attributable to their very strong and well-shooting artillery, which has weakened and shaken the defender to such an extent that he often did not even accept the infantry attack.\"\nGeneral von Seeckt hoped that the line north of the Carpathians could be held. However, he emphasized that a guarantee for repelling Russian attacks could not be assumed given the current condition of part of the troops; the infantry's operational strength of all three</body>\n", "062": "\n<pageno>395</pageno>\n<header>Army Group Mackensen: Expansion of Permanent Positions.</header>\n<body>build. After the bridgehead of Nanesti was taken on January 19, the mobile warfare had also come to an end here. However, the expansion of the positions encountered great difficulties. The 9th Army reported: \"With the beginning of trench warfare, the harsh Romanian winter suddenly came with severe frost and snowfall. The accommodation was very poor, on the right wing of the Kraewel Corps (General Command 54) it was almost completely lacking. In connection with this, the aftereffects of the great exertions of the past months showed, morale sank, the health condition worsened. In particular, 3000 cases of frostbite are to be lamented, including a number of fatalities, and a large number of illnesses that required amputations.\" The Turks in particular suffered from the cold. In the lowland fronts from the Danube to north of Focsani, the land offered no building materials. The villages consisted of mud huts. There was no forest. The supply on the extraordinarily bad roads was difficult. Thus, the expansion of the positions and accommodations in this front section was particularly delayed. It was better from Focsani to the left wing of the army group. Here, the vineyards could provide obstacle stakes; the wine cellars were expanded into protective shelters. By the end of January, work had already begun on the construction of a second line of defense.\nIn general, the harassment by enemy artillery was low. The snowstorm prevailing in the last days of January severely hindered business activity. But the expansion of the positions also came to a standstill, as all forces were needed to keep the trenches free of snow.\nAt the beginning of February, milder weather with snowdrifts favored increased activity of enemy reconnaissance units, which also advanced over the ice of the Sereth. On February 10, the army group considered an imminent enemy offensive against the 9th Army possible, before they had completed the expansion of their position and the onset of thawing weather would hinder enemy troop movements and supply. They took care to provide reserves by withdrawing forces from the front. Aerial reconnaissance and raiding parties, however, revealed no changes in the enemy that would indicate imminent attacks. The removal of troops was significantly delayed by unfavorable rail conditions and ice drift on the Danube, which brought shipping to a complete standstill at the end of January.

A relief was the conviction gained from aerial reports of September 7 that the enemy was withdrawing troops from Riga. The rest of the 115th Infantry Division could be assigned to Army Group Linsingen, and the withdrawal of the 76th Reserve Division was considered. On the other hand, due to pressure from the Supreme Army Command, the formation of the 216th Infantry Division had to be accelerated to replace the exhausted 105th Infantry Division of Army Group Archduke Karl.\nOnly thanks to the good work of the intelligence service, particularly the deciphering of Russian radio messages, aerial observations, and prisoner statements, was the command on the Eastern Front mostly able to recognize the enemy's intentions in time to take countermeasures. The reports received by the morning of September 9 indicated the relocation of the general commands of the Russian Guards and the XXXIV Corps to the area just west and northwest of Luck. Aircraft confirmed the advance of enemy columns on Torczyn and southward. Attacks further north, against the Hauer Cavalry Corps, apparently only served to conceal these measures. The Eastern Commander-in-Chief expected an attack by the mentioned three corps against the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. On the southern flank of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, General von Eben anticipated the continuation of the attacks. Therefore, when the replacement of the Russian I Guards Corps by the XXV Corps was reliably established during the day, Prince Leopold ordered additional forces to be brought up behind the threatened section without delay. There were a total of three regiments, while another regiment and artillery of the Gronau Army Detachment were prepared on the railway near Iwanowo (40 kilometers west of Pinsk). Additionally, Army Group Linsingen was to withdraw the 75th Reserve Division from the front and lead it to Kowel if possible.\nThe attacks against the Hauer Cavalry Corps continued until September 11. The primarily affected Bavarian Cavalry Division under Lieutenant General von Hellnigrath bravely defended all its positions. A gas attack by the Russians on the night of September 11 against the right wing of the X Army Corps north of Zaturce caused no significant damage.</body>\n<footer>1) G. 367. 2) G. 368.</footer>\n", "103": "\n<pageno>545</pageno>\n<header>Troop Directory.</header>\n<body>\nMiscellaneous.\nAfghanistan 420.\nEgypt 416 f. 420 f.\nAlbania 338. 341. 344.\nArab Uprising 414. 420 f.\nBelgium 463 f. 476.\nBulgaria 4. 25 f. 193 ff. 199 f. 214 f. 337.\n341 f. 345. 431 f. 435. 454. 474.\nDenmark 18. 429. 445 ff. 450 ff. 455. 459.\n469 f. 477. 501.\nDardanelles 414. 416. 423.\nNutritional Conditions 36. 481 ff.\nGreece 25. 50. 200. 337 ff. 344 ff.\n432. 473. 489.\nHindenburg Program 32 f. 41. 478. 500.\nHolland 3. 18. 445 f. 450. 455. 459. 469 f.\n477. 482. 501. 510.\nItaly 50. 388. 437. 465. 472. 482. 489.\n493 ff. 503. 505.\nJapan 388.\nWar Service Law 35.\nWar Economy 33. 36. 38 ff. 41 ff. 482 f.\nNorway 429.\nPalestine 416 f. 421 f.\nPersia 414. 416. 418 ff.\nPoland 274 f. 475 f.\nPortugal 388.\nRomania 3 ff. 19. 23. 26. 28. 31. 47 ff.\n52. 103. 105. 116. 189. 192 ff. 198 ff.\n215. 219. 331. 337. 348 ff. 351 f. 386 f.\n389 f. 392. 406. 408. 410. 415. 431 f.\n435. 438. 442. 444 ff. 453. 455. 459.\n472. 480. 483 f. 487 ff. 497 f.\nArmament Program 32 ff. 36. 43. 482 f.\n513.\nSalonika 48. 50. 193. 196. 338. 344. 414.\n432 f. 448. 487.\nSweden 429. 451. 477.\nSwitzerland 185. 437. 456. 462. 469 f. 477.\n482. 510.\nSerbia 436. 438. 497 f.\nSlavs 472.\nSlovaks 472.\nSpain 450. 456.\nSuez Canal 414. 417. 421.\n\"Sweet\" Dispute 452.\nAunt 68 ff. 75. 81 f. 86 f. 98 ff. 104. 113.\n422. 510.\nCzechs 472. 488.\nTurkey 4. 26. 200. 415 ff. 435. 454. 472.\n474.\nSubmarine War 3. 5. 18. 427 f. 438. 443 ff.\n454 ff. 476 ff. 488 f. 494 f. 501. 507.\n510. 514.\nPatriotic Auxiliary Service 39 f. 453 f.\nUnited States of America 7. 43 ff.\n447. 449 ff. 456. 458 ff. 464 ff. 473.\n477. 479.\n</body>\n", "085": "\n<pageno>527</pageno>\n<header>Index of Persons.</header>\n<body>\nRachitich, Serbian General 433.\nRabetnitsch, Russian General, Commander-in-Chief 10th Army 350.\nRadko Dmitrijew, Russian General, Commander-in-Chief 12th Army 350. 399 ff.\nRadoslawow, Bulgarian Prime Minister 340 f. 474.\nRagosia, Russian General, Commander-in-Chief 4th Army 350.\nRath, Austro-Hungarian Colonel, Commander 8th Mountain Brigade 308.\nvon Rauch, Major, Chief of Intelligence Dept. of the O.

On the following day, Russian troop movements\nfrom there to the northern wing of the army were observed. \u2014\nMeanwhile, preparations for the recapture of Koritnica were completed\nwith the Linsingen Army Group. The army group had been reinforced with\n14 \"heavy batteries2), so that a total of about 65 heavy and light batteries\ncould prepare the attack; four infantry regiments were held in reserve\nbehind the section. On September 26, the combat squadron again attacked\nsupport positions, battery positions, and troop camps of the enemy. After\nfive hours of artillery preparation, the assault began on September 27. The\nGerman assault troops under Generals von Rundel and von Kleist struck\ninto enemy preparations, but after fierce fighting achieved full success. The\nterrain gained beyond the former front line was held against heavy counter-\nattacks lasting until the next morning. 3000 prisoners, 44 machine guns,\nand two guns remained in German hands.\nThe expectation that the Russians would now attack the northern wing\nof the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army was confirmed as early as September 30.\nThe Commander-in-Chief East sent four battalions and two batteries there.\nAlthough he also considered a \"repetition of the attacks against the southern\nwing of this army \"not unlikely,\" he was aware that \"the northern wing of\nthe southern army, unsupported by reserves, whose defense was a precondition\nfor holding the positions of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, had to be\nassisted first and foremost. Against this, the enemy advanced on both sides\nof the Brody\u2014Olczow road and the Brody\u2014Lemberg railway line. South of\nthe road, he succeeded in the afternoon in pushing the Austro-Hungarian\n27th Infantry Division out of their positions over a width of three kilometers;\nreserves absorbed the blow. Otherwise, the enemy was repelled except for a\nsmall, soon balanced breach at the railway line. The counterattack by four\nGerman and two Austro-Hungarian battalions under Lieutenant General\nMeixner led to the recapture of the lost position section as early as October 1.\n2000 men and 13 machine guns were captured. Thus, the fighting at the\nAustro-Hungarian 2nd Army initially subsided again.\nWith the Linsingen Army Group, the Russian artillery raged since the\nnight of October 1 with an intensity not previously seen on the Eastern Front\nagainst the front of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army.

East: Failure of Russian Breakthrough Attempts at Army Group Linsingen.</header>\n<body>Szelwow was soon completely balanced out by counterattacks. However, due to its great superiority, the enemy finally managed to break into the position at the northern flank of the group Bockmann, which consisted partly of Landwehr troops, at Korytnica; it was sealed off by German battalions that had meanwhile traveled there. A counterattack undertaken the following day at first light encountered a new, strong attack by the enemy and broke through. The Commander-in-Chief East, as well as the army group, assigned all available reserves, a total of eight battalions, to the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. In addition, the Commander-in-Chief East held back a regiment of the 217th Infantry Division, which was just rolling to Serbia, and brought back a regiment of the 49th Reserve Division, which had just been transferred to the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army. Generaloberst von Linsingen considered the recapture of Korytnica \"absolutely necessary,\" but initially did not have the forces for it. The Russians continued their attacks here, albeit unsuccessfully, until September 22nd1).</body>\n<body>The reserves for the defensive battles as well as for allocations to the Supreme Army Command had recently been taken mainly from the Eichhorn Army Group by the Commander-in-Chief East. However, since September 17th, the accumulation of forces behind the enemy front in the Smorgon\u2014Wiszniew-See section (Russian XX, XXXVI, and XXIV Corps) suggested offensive intentions; the I Siberian Corps was also identified at Smorgon. On the other hand, the Commander-in-Chief East increasingly came to the conclusion that \"no sustained attacks are to be expected in the foreseeable future\" at the Woyrsch Army Group. Seven heavy batteries moved from there to the Linsingen Army Group on September 21st, as the enemy was evidently preparing new attacks against the Marwitz Group. He relieved his exhausted divisions of the first line and brought in additional forces: The General Commands XXVI and XXV Corps were identified west of Luck on September 23rd. Aircraft observed lively transport movements over Rach to the west until the 25th. The Commander-in-Chief East came to the conviction that the enemy was uniting \"new, very strong forces\" here, and ordered that all parts of the 218th Infantry Division, after completion of deployment, be immediately transported from the Eichhorn and Woyrsch Army Groups to his disposal at Wladimir-Wolynsk. The Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army also found the enemy on September 25th, having already unsuccessfully attacked the southern flank two days earlier.</body>\n<footer>1) See p. 387.</footer>\n", "099": "\n<pageno>541</pageno>\n<header>Troop Directory.</header>\n<body>\nFrance.\nMinister of War 440 f.\nSupreme Council of National Defense 389.\nArmy Command, Supreme Leadership 50. 53 f.\n65. 88. 349. 388. 433. 436. 439.\nArmy 7. 46. 434. 439. 502.\nArmy Group North 53 f. 436.\nArmy Group Center 133. 436.\nArmy Group Reserve 436.\n2nd Army 117 f. 124. 133. 135. 145 f. 172.\n4th Army 118.\n6th Army 54. 63. 65. 67. 89. 95. 177. 436.\n10th Army 54. 67. 84. 89. 177. 436.\nSarrail Army (Entente Army at Salonika) 25. 45. 48 f. 191. 208. 332. 337 ff.\n341. 344 ff. 387 f. 390. 408. 415. 431 ff.\n439. 489. 494.\nFortified Sector Verdun 127. 131.\n133. 153. 186.\nI Corps 63. 67.\nII Corps 67. 441.\nV Corps 67.\nVI Corps 67.\nVII Corps 63. 67.\nXX Corps 67.\nXXI Corps 67.\nXXXII Corps 67.\nXXXIII Corps 67.\nXXXIV Corps 67.\nXXXV Corps 67.\nII Colonial Corps 67.\n1st Cavalry Corps 67.\n2nd Cavalry Corps 67.\nGroup DE (XI Corps) 133 f.\n1st Infantry Division 67.\n2nd Infantry Division 67.\n3rd Infantry Division 67.\n4th Infantry Division 67.\n7th Infantry Division 134. 145.\n9th Infantry Division 134. 145.\n10th Infantry Division 67.\n13th Infantry Division 67.\n21st Infantry Division 67.\n22nd Infantry Division 134.\n28th Infantry Division 134.\n33rd Infantry Division 134. 140.\n37th Infantry Division 134. 156. 164.\n38th Infantry Division 132. 134. 140 f. 145. 156.\n43rd Infantry Division 67.\n45th Infantry Division 67.\n46th Infantry Division 67.\n47th Infantry Division 67.\n55th Infantry Division 135.\n63rd Infantry Division 134 f. 145.\n66th Infantry Division 67.\n74th Infantry Division 67.\n77th Infantry Division 67.\n121st Infantry Division 67.\n126th Infantry Division 156.\n130th Infantry Division 135.\n133rd Infantry Division 134. 140 ff. 145. 156.\n15th Colonial Division 67.\n4th J\u00e4ger Brigade 67.\nAir Forces 57. 59 f. 67. 73. 75. 78.\n88. 92. 99. 102. 109 ff. 133. 148. 154.\n156. 169. 184. 188. 427. 434. 436.\nFortresses:\nBelfort 185. 510.\nVerdun 6. 8 f. 13 f. 17 f. 45. 47 f. 58.\n74. 103. 105. 117 ff. 123. 129 f.\n132 ff. 138. 141 f. 148 f. 151 f. 164 ff.\n169. 172 f. 179. 181 ff. 186 ff. 405.\n435 f. 442. 457. 480 f. 483. 490 f.\n500 f. 503 ff. 509.\n</body>\n", "037": "\n<pageno>370</pageno>\n<header>The Battles on the Russian Front: Brusilov Offensive.</header>\n<body>were previously excluded with regard to the battles in neighboring sections.\nAfter heavy Russian artillery fire had already been located on the section of the Turkish corps on September 23, a Russian attack began on the 24th, but it failed against the stubborn defense of the Turkish infantry. The day before, attacks on the southern flank of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had been repelled by the German 197th and 195th Infantry Divisions. South of Manajno, an Austro-Hungarian regiment, which had retaken the lost position after night fighting, mainly against overwhelming troops, made 400 prisoners. On September 25, renewed strong attacks at this location failed. The army group continued to assess the situation as the center of the southern army \"with significantly reduced combat strengths facing new heavily massed attacks.\" Three Russian corps were assumed here. On September 30, the enemy attacked again after seven hours of artillery preparation, involving guns up to 28 cm caliber, with strong forces. While the German XV Corps, after temporarily losing smaller bridgeheads, fully maintained its positions, the attacker at Hofmann's Corps managed to establish himself in the front line over a width of about two kilometers. In the following two days, he expanded the breach despite the use of parts of the army reserve; the commanding height of Lysionia (399 meters), three kilometers southwest of Brzezany, was lost but recaptured by newly arrived parts of the 36th Reserve Division in a counterattack. The recapture of the remaining terrain had to be postponed for a few days due to the ammunition situation. Meanwhile, on October 24, the German southern army left the association of the army group Archduke Karl and transferred to the Commander-in-Chief East.</body>\n<header>2.

These had so far been directed equally against the Austro-Hungarian Army Group Archduke Karl with the aim of breaking into Hungary as well as against the southern wing of the Commander-in-Chief East (including 2nd Army and Army Group Linsingen), which defended the routes to Lemberg and Kowel. In connection with the now expected Romanian offensive, the direction towards Hungary gained increased significance.\nRegarding the situation at the time of the transfer of command on the Eastern Front, General Ludendorff wrote after the war\u00b9): \"We looked forward to further battles there with a certain calm, even if the tension, especially with Army Group Linsingen, was by no means overcome. Army Group Archduke Karl had not yet gained a foothold. We had to be prepared for further setbacks here. After Romania's declaration of war, the Carpathians gained different significance. The encirclement of our southern wing no longer needed to squeeze between the Dniester and the Moldau, it now had a broad base of operations throughout Romania and could become extremely effective...\".\nThe task for the Eastern Front was clearly outlined: Hold against all enemy attacks with the utmost limitation of forces.\nRegarding the details of the situation south of the Pripet, Generaloberst von Conrad on August 26 laid out the following in a memorandum transmitted to Army Group Archduke Karl and the Commander-in-Chief East: He expected that the Russians would direct the main thrust of their attacks against the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, to break into Transylvania and Hungary over the Carpathians. For this, the Russian 9th Army had nine to ten infantry and four to five cavalry divisions available according to the present reports; another division was supposed to be on the move towards Bukovina. He no longer expected a Russian offensive against the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army. Also north of the Dniester, opposite the German Southern Army, the attack seemed to be prepared, as the Generaloberst suspected, due to the threat to the northern flank of the ever-lengthening Carpathians. However, the enemy was possibly in the process of forming a strike group of six divisions (II., XXII., XXXIII. Corps) north of the Dniester. Against the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, he prepared an attack with eight divisions (5th Siberian, 17th, 7th, and 6th Corps) on both sides of the Tarnopol\u2014Buczacz and Lemberg railway, while the attack at Brody seemed to have come to a halt. In the area</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) \"Memories\", p. 193 f.</footer>\n", "038": "\n<pageno>371</pageno>\n<header>O.B.

The target of the attack seemed here, as before, initially the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army and particularly the Litzmann Group, where the enemy apparently wanted to break through to Wladimir-Wolynsk again. Whether he had given up his attacks against the Bernhardi Army Group with Kowel as the breakthrough target was not yet clear.\nOn the extended front north of the Army Group Linsingen to the Gulf of Riga, there was temporary calm. However, there was uncertainty about the Russian intentions in the far north, in the section north of Mitau. Generaloberst von Eichhorn expected an attack there by at least twelve Russian divisions and many heavy batteries; reserves were prepared.\nBefore the new Russian attacks against the Army Group Linsingen began, Lieutenant General Clausius of the Bernhardi Group, after a failed attempt on August 23, again launched a counterattack on the 28th to repel the Russians at Toboly from the western</body>\n<footer>1) See more on page 364.\n2) Structure of the Army Group Linsingen from the right flank:\nArmy Group of Gen. of Cav. v. d.

It was achieved with extremely limited means against overwhelming odds. They lived completely hand to mouth. They were forced to throw individual regiments into battle, where the enemy operated with divisions. On the other hand, the enemy was relatively weak in artillery and ammunition and sought to compensate for such a deficiency through ruthless mass deployment of infantry.\nThe German officer had a severe test to endure, for even in the sections under Austro-Hungarian command, the main burden of the battle often lay on the German troops. They were the ones repeatedly called to assist at threatened points and had to hold out in the most fiercely contested places. Above all, in reliance on the efficiency of their German troops, even the middle command maintained full confidence through the most severe crises. For among the Austro-Hungarian units, there were many very capable fighters, but also numerous ones of such low combat value that they repeatedly required support. Early on, however, the German Supreme Army Command took measures to strengthen the morale of these troops through training behind the front, and in many places, improvement had already been achieved through understanding cooperation. In general, however, direct influence on the allied troops was still difficult, and attempts in this direction understandably also led to various disagreements. Mostly, they had to limit themselves to inserting German divisions, occasionally even individual regiments, and a corresponding number of German command authorities as supports into the Austro-Hungarian front. All these measures, which General Ludendorff had already begun in July of the previous year with the expanded command in the East, have since been continued in an ever-increasing manner.\nThe leadership north of the Carpathians was gradually entirely placed in the hands of the new Commander-in-Chief East.

Besides the 208th, which had meanwhile arrived behind the right army \nwing, the 216th Infantry Division was in prospect as a reserve for the \narmy group, which, however, was not to begin unloading until September 10 at the earliest.\nAt the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, there seemed to be no immediate danger. On \nSeptember 9, General von Seeckt pointed out in a report to the Supreme \nArmy Command the mutually weak forces in this section of the front; \nalso, the terrain with its multiple successive sections seemed to him \nunsuitable for an \"offensive of greater scale,\" although surprises had to be expected everywhere. \nThe serious situation with the neighboring armies then led to the decision to transfer the Austro-Hungarian \n30th Infantry Division to the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, and the 119th Infantry Division to the \nSouthern Army, which was to give up the remnants of the divisions of the Austro-Hungarian XIII Corps \nthat had been shattered in the recent battles.\nIn front of the Southern Army's front, the enemy, according to aerial \nobservations and prisoner statements, brought in further reinforcements, \nagain against the extreme northern wing, so that continuation of the attacks was \nexpected here. General Count Bothmer faced them with confidence and suggested \noffensive action with the existing six German divisions (including the 105th Infantry \nDivision) against the northern wing of the enemy strike group, which the army group \nrejected in consideration of the overall situation.\nThe following days led to the impression that the enemy's strength \nin front of the right wing and the center of the army had initially weakened, but \nthat he was preparing to continue the attack against the left wing and the right \nof the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army. The VII Siberian Corps was identified near Tarnopol. \nGeneral Ludendorff recommended moving the parts of the 216th Infantry Division that had \narrived so far behind the Austro-Hungarian IX Corps, to which the Germans no longer had full \nconfidence due to its numerous Romanian troops. However, by September 14, \nthe distribution of forces on the enemy side made an attack against the \ncenter of the Southern Army \u2014 1st Reserve Division, Turkish XV Corps, and \nsouthern wing of the Austro-Hungarian Hofmann Corps \u2014 likely. The Russian \nXXXIII, perhaps also the VII Siberian Corps, had apparently been moved there. \nThus, by the morning of September 15, the army group moved the 208th and 216th Infantry Divisions1) \nbehind those sections.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) A regiment had been held back at the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army.\n</footer>\n", "039": "\n<pageno>372</pageno>\n<header>The Battles on the Russian Front: Brusilov Offensive.</header>\n<body>To drive away from the Stochod bank. Despite the provision of 21 battalions, \n17 batteries of heavy and light field howitzers and mortars, as well as \n24 cannon batteries, success was lacking. The newly deployed Russian \n65th Division offered stubborn resistance. Our own losses amounted to \nmore than 800 men. The artillery preparation \u2014 according to the army \ngroup \u2014 was sufficient, but the inappropriate use of the infantry, \nwhich advanced with weak forces on a common front, but held back the main forces \nas reserves, led to failure1). Considering the \nstrong Russian concentration of forces in front of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, General \nvon Linsingen had to refrain from attempting the attack again. \nThe enemy seemed to form a shock group in front of the Litzmann group of the Austro-Hungarian \n4th Army. Three German regiments were positioned behind the section; \nat Kowel, the Commander-in-Chief East kept a \nreserve of five battalions ready to load, parts of which he moved behind the Bernhardi group on \nAugust 30.\nOn August 31, the Russian attack, well prepared by artillery and mine \nthrowers, began in a width of about 15 kilometers from Korytnica to \nnorth of Szelwow. The enemy \u2014 troops of the Russian \nVIII, IV Siberian, and XXXX Corps \u2014 managed to break through seriously only in two places, \nparticularly at Korytnica, where initially the \nAustro-Hungarian Cavalry Corps Leonhardi and then the northern adjoining wing \nof the Austro-Hungarian 11th Infantry Division gave way, as well as the Hungarian 70th Infantry \nDivision south of Szelwow; the \"most unpleasantly noticeable\" \nAustro-Hungarian artillery \"made itself again most unpleasantly noticeable\" is recorded in the war diary of the army group. \nThe German 10th Landwehr Division, adjoining north of Szelwow, under Lieutenant General von Stoecken, managed to withstand all \nattacks. At the particularly heavily attacked front of the \nSzurmay Corps, the breakthrough was prevented by the German battalions distributed among the troops \nof this corps and the reserves deployed by General Litzmann, maintaining the position everywhere until the morning of \nSeptember 1. At the southern breach point, \nthe enemy, who had reached Swiniuchy, could only be pushed back to the western shore of \nKorytnica by a counterattack ordered by General B\u00f6ttmann. By the evening of September 1, \nthe situation was stabilized enough that the Litzmann group, as well as the \narmy group command, could calmly face further attacks. \nThey lasted until September 3, without the Russians achieving any significant \n</body>\n", "069": "\n<pageno>402</pageno>\n<header>The Battles on the Russian Front.</header>\n<body>completely. \"The matter must be brought to an end!\" General von Scholz decided to preempt the enemy. He hoped to break through the Russian front west of Lake Babit to the Gulf of Riga and thereby significantly shorten the course of his own front. The Commander-in-Chief East also believed that the enemy must be made aware that any blows from him would be immediately met with hard counterblows. To carry this out, the Supreme Army Command released the 1st Reserve Division, which had already been designated for the West. However, since it had to be relieved at the Dvina front by the advancing 2nd Bavarian Landwehr Division, it could not be expected until January 19. General von Pappritz deployed the division based on the attack directive of the 8th Army immediately west of the Aa, to advance together with the 2nd Infantry Division on both sides of the river beyond the old positions up to the line Plugge\u2014A\u00dflern. The enemy seemed to have the VI Siberian Corps, eight Latvian regiments, and probably the 38th Division west of the railway to Riga up to the Aa, and west of the Aa to the coast of the XXXXIII Corps. The attacking troops of the Mitau group consisted of 62 battalions in total, largely worn out by the previous battles and not yet assembled. Of these, 39 battalions were deployed in the actual attack area on both sides of the Aa. They thus had a strong numerical superiority ahead of them.\nOn January 23, at dawn, the German artillery fire from 352 guns, including 133 medium and heavy ones, began. The effect in the attack terrain, which was covered with dense forest over long stretches, was not sufficient. The 2nd Infantry Division under Major General Reifer initially had success only on its outer flanks; the center advanced only in the afternoon hours when the flank attack from the Aa became noticeable. It succeeded in regaining parts of the old German blockhouse position in the Mangaler Bruch. The 1st Reserve Division under Lieutenant General von Malachowski, west of the Aa, also gained ground only slowly; in heavy fighting that continued into the night, it reached the same level as the 2nd Infantry Division near Parup. On January 24, the attack against the Dune area at Mangaler Bruch also continued.</body>\n<footer>1) Regarding the leadership of the attack, Gen. von Pappritz and A.O.K. 8 had differing views.

On September 2, from the Linsingen Army Group, although it was itself heavily attacked\u00b9), the Leib-Hussar Brigade was unloaded behind the northern flank of the Southern Army, followed by the infantry in approximately brigade strength. The 3rd Guard Infantry Division, rolling from the west to Transylvania, was diverted to Halicz.\nBy September 5, the old position at Brzezany was retaken through the intervention of a hastily brought-in regiment of the 199th Infantry Division. However, in the Gerok Group, the enemy succeeded on this day in once again pressing the front in a width of ten kilometers with five divisions. In view of the heavy losses of the 1st Reserve and 105th Infantry Division, the latter of which apparently had not yet regained its full combat value after the events of early August\u00b2), Count Bothmer, in agreement with the Army Group, decided to withdraw the Gerok Group around the right flank of the Turkish XV Corps by up to 15 kilometers on the night of September 6 to prevent the danger of an operational breakthrough.\nThe position now ran, bending back from the mouth of the Gnila-Lipa behind the Narajowka section, and from Sniesolniki in a northeasterly direction at the railway front point Potutory south of Brzezany back to the old position. The Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, where it had remained calm, had to bend its left flank accordingly, deployed the 119th Infantry Division here, and kept its reserves (Austro-Hungarian 30th Infantry Division, about 6000 men) behind this flank. The new position of the Southern Army was somewhat shorter than the previous one but without any development. The High Command judged in the war diary: \"Whether a longer resistance can be offered in it will entirely depend on how much time remains for the development of the position and whether the Gerok Group, which has only slightly more than one and a half divisions (1st Reserve and half of the 199th Infantry Division) of reliable infantry, can still be supplied with fresh forces for the occupation of its over 20-kilometer-wide front.\"\n</body>\n<footer>\n\u00b9) See p. 372 f.\n\u00b2) Vol. X, pp. 550 and 554.\n</footer>\n", "023": "\n<pageno>356</pageno>\n<header>The Battles on the Russian Front: Brusilov Offensive.</header>\n<body>To concentrate slightly superior forces at points along the long front, which the defender cannot quickly counter with corresponding forces, because distance and the lack of quickly exploitable connections hinder him, and he must not expose other positions too much. The current almost universal ability of the mountains to accommodate infantry facilitates envelopment for the attacker and makes road and pass blockades not yet appear sufficient.\"\nThe Austro-Hungarian military command refused to send troops in view of the forces required against Romania and demanded that the army group, after stabilizing the situation at the Southern Army, where Russian attacks had collapsed on September 8, and given the enemy's weakness, should support the Carpathian front with its own resources from the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army. Thus, it was forced on September 11 to bring up the Austro-Hungarian 30th Infantry Division from the 3rd Army to deploy it between the S\u00fcr\u00e9n Corps and the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Cavalry Division. The German supreme military command considered sending the 214th Infantry Division from the west, but had to refrain from doing so the next day due to the situation there. Consequently, on September 14, the army group decided to also move the Austro-Hungarian 59th Infantry Division from the 3rd to the 7th Army, where the Austro-Hungarian I Corps command was also deployed between the Austro-Hungarian XI and Carpathian Corps during these days.\nBy mid-September, the 7th Army, now consisting of nine German and Austro-Hungarian infantry and four cavalry divisions, faced a total of ten Russian infantry and about three cavalry divisions, with a mixed Romanian-Russian detachment of about eight battalions and a Romanian cavalry division on its southern flank. On September 16, the enemy resumed his attacks with increased pressure along the entire front. In particular, he attempted to break through north of Kirlibaba with the Hungarian 40th Infantry Division by bringing in another division, while simultaneously attacking the heights of the 200th Infantry Division on both sides of the Ludowa with masses. Both positions suffered territorial losses.</body>\n<footer>1) G. 367. \u2014 2) 117, Austro-Hungarian 34th J. D. and \u00bd Hungarian 202.

B. East: Defensive Preparations with Limited Means.</header>\n<body>On the night of September 12, General Ludendorff, pointing out the transport of strong Russian forces from Riga to the south, requested the release of the 76th Reserve Division in addition to the 216th Infantry Division, which was to be replaced at the D\u00fcnna Front by the 105th Infantry Division, as well as heavy artillery soon thereafter. He also requested the acceleration of the formation of the 218th Infantry Division.\nIn the effort to make more troops available, Prince Leopold believed he could withdraw parts from the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, as it had remained unexpectedly quiet there in recent days. Orders had already been given when on September 16, strong Russian attacks resumed here*) as well as with the Linsingen Army Group.\nWithin the Linsingen Army Group, differences had gradually developed between the leader of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, Generaloberst von Terszty\u00e1nszky, and General Litzmann, which made further proper cooperation impossible. However, since General Litzmann's personality had an unmistakably favorable influence on the Austro-Hungarian troops, Generaloberst von Linsingen had him exchanged with General von der Marwitz on September 15. The following morning, the Russian attack began against his new sector, about 20 kilometers wide, from Pustomyty to south of Zaturce. The enemy deployed four corps (I and II Guards as well as XXXX Corps, parts of the VIII Corps, and the 20th Division), all core troops of the Russian army, in dense waves to storm, which at times attacked the positions more than six times. It hit the B\u00f6dmann Group, the Szurmay Corps, and the southern flank of the Austro-Hungarian X Corps, but broke down against the well-prepared defense of the defenders. Combat Squadron 2 successfully attacked the Luck railway station as well as artillery positions and reserves of the enemy. As the enemy stormed, the infantry had already expended its ammunition in some places, so they repelled the assault with hand grenades. Where the Russian infantry penetrated, it was partly repelled without the use of reserves. Alongside German troops, especially the 108th Infantry and 10th Landwehr Divisions, the Austro-Hungarians also fully shared in the success.

However, heavy counterattacks then hit the right flank of the 2nd Infantry Division and pushed it back to its starting positions. At 17 degrees cold, the German infantry clung to snow-covered dune heights and frost-stiffened swamp trenches for defense, excellently supported by aircraft, despite 40 degrees cold in the higher air layers.\nGeneral von Scholtz ordered the attack to be resumed on February 1 after thorough preparation. But even before that, the Russians launched new mass assaults east of the Aa on January 31. At midnight, they penetrated the German lines west of the Mangaler Break. The last three days of fighting again cost the German troops about 4000 men. The cold rose to 28 degrees; especially the wounded suffered severely. The army command reported: \"Continuation of the attack on the Aa requires new preparations and will not take place before February 3.\"\nThe Commander-in-Chief East still held the goal of regaining the former German first position. However, the Supreme Army Command already had reservations about continuing the attack; on February 1, General Ludendorff asked to consider whether the expenditure of men and ammunition might still lead to cessation. The command of the 8th Army no longer considered maintaining the old first position absolutely necessary. When General Ludendorff, in view of the losses, again asked on the night of February 2 whether the continuation of the attack was absolutely necessary, whether it could not be finally stopped, the Commander-in-Chief East reported that the 8th Army intended to gain only a viable permanent position.\nOn February 3, the 2nd Infantry Division was to attack again. But at over 30 degrees cold, precise artillery and mortar fire was not feasible. Parts of the assault position had to be cleared under their own fire. Thus, it only resulted in an unsuccessful partial advance.\nThe German counterattack on the Aa, perhaps begun with exaggerated hopes, ended without significant success. Two German divisions, intended for the battle in the West, were withdrawn and significantly weakened. On February 4, the transport of the 2nd Infantry Division to the West began.\n</body>\n", "022": "\n<pageno>355</pageno>\n<header>Assessment of the Situation by General von Seeckt.</header>\n<body>to prevent the Russians from advancing into the White Theiss Valley and their advance against the Borsa\u2014Kirlibaba road. General von Conta was forced to withdraw the 1st Infantry Division by September 9, abandoning the Magura and the Kruhula Ricerta to a position up to five kilometers back.\nMeanwhile, on September 8, in response to a repeatedly made demand by the German Supreme Army Command, Colonel General Freiherr von Pflanzer-Baltin was relieved of command over the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army; his successor was General of Cavalry Freiherr von Kirchbach (Lauterbach1). In view of the fierce attacks by the Russian divisions against the heavily battered 1st Infantry Division and the Hungarian 40th Division on the right, General von Seeckt reported to the Supreme Army Command on September 9 that further Russian advances against the indispensable Kirlibaba\u2014Borsa road must be prevented at all costs, as a breakthrough would separate the two main parts of the army. The position held by the 200th Infantry Division \"with outstanding activity\" on both sides of the Ludowa seemed to him little threatened, especially since the already mentioned German Landsturm Regiment had arrived there. Four battalions and the bulk of the artillery of the 10th Bavarian Infantry Division were to be deployed with the 1st Infantry Division, which, unaccustomed to mountain warfare, had lost 1700 men, including 1100 missing2) in the heavy fighting of the last ten days. While \"the enemy's strength seems to be running out\" in front of the extreme right wing of the army \u2014 a support was offered by a Bavarian regiment standing there \u2014 General von Seeckt also considered the situation on the left wing of the army serious. Although a minor success had been achieved in recent days by the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Cavalry Division through a counterattack by the German Cyclist Brigade, he expected the enemy to attempt to seize the Tartar Pass from both sides, for which he could deploy a total of five divisions. It was necessary to hold the current position, as further back positions were unfavorable in every direction despite shortening the lines. The 7th Army, however, had no more free regiments, so General von Kirchbach requested two divisions. The army group could not provide them. In the Carpathian defense, the numerical balance of forces could not be the only basis: \"The attacker can at individual</body>\n<footer>1) Previously Commanding General of the Austro-Hungarian I Corps.\n2) The total losses of the 1st I.D. in September amounted to 3100 men, almost half of whom were missing.</footer>\n", "070": "\n<pageno>403</pageno>\n<header>O.B. East: Winter Battle at the Aa, German Counterattack.</header>\n<body>The main attack set up barely unfolded under overwhelming Russian machine gun fire. Enemy counterattacks were repelled by the German lines embedded in deep snow. West of the Aa, the 1st Reserve Division made progress; further advances east to the river were denied.\nAlready in the afternoon, the Army High Command 8 reported that the attack consumed more forces than expected and was not advancing quickly; the deployment of the Russian XXVII Corps was to be expected. This would completely shift the balance of forces. Continuing the attack to the set goal was highly desirable and tactically and morally so significant that it justified the deployment of additional forces. A new combat-ready division was necessary. General von Eichhorn had already allocated all forces that could be freed up to the attack step. The Commander-in-Chief East was also unable to meet the new troop demand, and the Supreme Army Command rejected further reinforcements. General von Scholz now wanted at least to retake the old German positions. The original attack objective should, as Major General von Sauberzweig emphasized in a consultation with Colonel Hoffmann, be pursued later. The recapture of the German positions was also considered necessary by the latter to prevent the Russians from thinking they could take over German positions unpunished.\nHowever, the continuation of the German attack on January 25 was preempted by the enemy. From 5 a.m. onwards, they attacked vigorously but unsuccessfully, particularly the flank of the 2nd Infantry Division at the Mangalzer Break. Only then could the German attack begin; by evening, it reached only the old second position between the Mangalzer Break and the Aa. West of the Aa, the 1st Reserve Division reached the same level. In the last three days, these two divisions had suffered 2000 men in bloody losses; the losses due to frost damage were again very high. However, the enemy had already left 2000 prisoners and 20 machine guns in German hands.\nOn January 26, the 2nd Infantry Division was to attack the eastern Aa bank, which, with its somewhat more open terrain, offered better effectiveness for the combined artillery of both divisions. However, strong enemy artillery fire kept the already severely weakened troops down. Individual advances were unsuccessful. The enemy had reinforced with the XXVII Corps.</body>\n", "059": "\n<pageno>392</pageno>\n<header>The Battles on the Russian Front: Brusilov Offensive.</header>\n<body>The unfortunate military conduct of Romania had forced the Russian command to gradually send the 9th Army, including 15 corps with 35 infantry divisions and 13 cavalry divisions, about a quarter of their total forces, to the section from the Romanian northern border to the Black Sea. Romania's entry into the war had extended the Russian front by more than 400 kilometers and burdened it with new dangers. The disappointment was great. The spirit of the Romanian soldiers was not very satisfactory; there was the impression that many considered the continuation of the fight useless and also feared that Russia might never give back the Moldavia, where its troops now stood.</body>\n<header>4. Final Considerations on the Brusilov Offensive.</header>\n<body>The Russians had not achieved their goal of finally breaking Austria-Hungary's resistance, despite Romania's military aid. Since the end of August, they had made only very slight progress. Their overall territorial gain was spatially significant but operationally negligible. More significant was that their five-month assaults had brought them a total of 450,000 prisoners and numerous other war spoils. This meant an extremely worrying attrition of the Austro-Hungarian army, whose losses primarily (about 90% in prisoners) were borne. In addition, and in connection with this, was the immobilization of numerous German divisions urgently needed elsewhere. With this result, Russia had not only achieved what was within its power but also made a decisive contribution to the overall war effort of the Entente in the summer and autumn of 1916. It had not shied away from losses. They had swollen to an enormous height; exact figures are missing, estimates are around 1,200,000 men. This extraordinarily high number, even for Russian standards, is explained primarily by the ruthless use of infantry masses, generally driven forward with exemplary bravery, but occasionally also by extreme means of coercion, repeatedly charging against the positions of the Central Powers to compensate for what was lacking in artillery strength.</body>\n<footer>1) See p. 396. 2) Connection to Vol. X, p. 564 ff. 3) A.

There were reports that he had withdrawn the IV Siberian Corps deployed in the Lucz area behind the front.\nMeanwhile, with the Army Group Bernhardi, an attack group composed of Prussian, Bavarian, and Austro-Hungarian troops under General Clausius on September 18 captured a Russian bridgehead advanced over the Stochod at Zarecze. The enemy lost more than 2,500 prisoners and 17 machine guns.\nOn September 19, the Russians resumed their breakthrough attempts against Group Marwitz, which they prepared with strong artillery fire, increased to drumfire. In the Pustomyty-Szelwow section, they were repulsed with heavy losses; in the other sections, their troops were evidently not brought to attack under the effective defensive fire, not even when Russian artillery covered their own trenches with fire. Using the darkness, the enemy began coordinated attacks against almost the entire front of Group Marwitz from 4 a.m. the following day. He deployed masses of infantry; fierce fighting ensued.

On the 30th, the war diary of the Southern Army recorded: \"Increased artillery activity of the enemy and the presence of stronger reserves on the northern flank of the army suggest the possibility of an imminent enemy attack there as well as on the southern flank.\" On August 31, the army was seriously attacked on both flanks simultaneously.\nThe attack in the north also hit the right flank of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army\u00b9). In this approximately eight-kilometer-wide combat section, the German 197th Infantry Division of the group of General of Infantry von Eben repelled the assault smoothly. On the adjacent flank of the Southern Army, however, the Russians broke through on both sides of the Bobrow\u2014Aloczow railway into a width of about four kilometers right up to the third line; the highest elevation of the section, the Zlota Gora, was lost but was recaptured by hunter companies of the 197th Infantry Division. Further south, on this day, countermeasures could not yet be effective, costing six guns in addition to significant losses in personnel. On the following day, September 1, the weak Austrian line between the road and railway was further pushed back by renewed Russian attacks, so that the 197th Infantry Division saw its right flank seriously threatened. However, the intervention of a German troop unit \u2014 strength about a brigade under Lieutenant General Mellior \u2014 set up by General von Eben for a counterattack, wrested a considerable portion of its terrain gain from the attacker and closed the already existing gap. At the same time, the 197th Infantry Division under Major General Wilhelm, which had to extend its right flank south to the Zlota Gora, repelled repeated strong attacks.\nTo secure the Zlota Gora in the hands of German troops, the border to the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army was moved south beyond the Bobrow\u2014Aloczow railway. Renewed Russian attacks on September 2 failed despite mass deployment, apart from a temporary breakthrough on the Zlota Gora, at the already re-established front. Similarly, on September 3, several strong enemy attack waves mostly collapsed in the defensive fire of the 197th Infantry Division.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Organization of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army: Group of Gen. of Inf. von Eben (Gen.

It is Russia's cause\u00b9). Its armies were supposed to hold back the enemy everywhere, in order to then carry out the attack against Bulgaria together with the Army of Saloniki. Romania's army was placed under the orders of the Russian Army Command; the French military plenipotentiary in Bucharest had to make clear to the Romanians the necessity of this measure\u00b2).\nThus, from the end of October, there existed a unified Russian-Romanian front from Riga to the Danube mouth under the Tsar as Supreme Commander. It was structured as follows:\nNorthern Front (with 6th, 12th, 5th and 1st Army) . . . . . 29\u00bd\nWestern Front (with 10th, 4th, 2nd and 3rd Army) . . . . . 32\u00bd\nSouthwestern Front with\n    Special Army . . . . . . . . . . 23\n    11th Army . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\u00bd\n    7th Army . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n    8th Army . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n    9th Army . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\n                                    Total     73\u00bd\nRomanian Army under King Ferdinand with\n    23\u00bd largely severely shaken divisions . .\nRussian Danube (formerly Dobruja, later\n    new 6th) Army . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n                Total without the Romanian troops 142\u00bd\n                            Infantry divisions.\nNovember. The relief attack of the 9th Army, initially scheduled for November 7th, had to be postponed as the necessary forces did not arrive in time. During repeated exchanges of views with General Joffre, General Alexeyev saw the assembly of one strong Russian army each on the flanks of the Romanians as the next task. Accordingly, it was planned to send additional forces to the Danube Army, and furthermore to form a new army (later the new 4th Army) between this and the 9th Army. The Russian Army Command still entertained the idea of attacking through the Eastern Carpathians into Transylvania after the assembly of sufficient forces, in order to bring the offensive of the Central Powers in Wallachia to a halt.
