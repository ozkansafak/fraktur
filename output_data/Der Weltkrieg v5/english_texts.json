Only now, as the operations had taken such a completely different turn, did it prove disadvantageous that the coast had not also been occupied immediately.\nThe large transports of the British expeditionary corps in August were carried out almost without German counteraction. The current demand for the use of submarines by the German General Staff led to the dispatch of \"U 9\" under Lieutenant Commander Weddigen into the Channel, resulting on September 22 in the destruction of the three English armored cruisers \"Aboukir,\" \"Hogue,\" and \"Cressy.\" Despite this brilliant achievement, which revealed to the army command for the first time what a sharp weapon the German warfare possessed in the submarines, an effective disruption of British transports remained naturally very dependent on chance due to the small number of German submarines.\nThe fleet was also to participate in supporting land operations in the East. On September 19, General v. Falkenhayn suggested to the Chief of the Admiralty Staff the execution of a fleet demonstration with strong high seas forces in the Baltic Sea; it was to simulate a large-scale landing by an infantry brigade on the Russian coast and thereby prevent enemy forces from being transported to Galicia. The Chief of the Admiralty Staff readily agreed to this undertaking.\nGeneral v. Falkenhayn also immediately established contact with the political leadership of the Reich. Like his predecessor, he saw a significant duty of the Chief of the General Staff in providing accurate and unbiased orientation to the leading statesman about the situation at the battlefronts; only through understanding cooperation between the Reich and army leadership did it seem possible to him to successfully implement a steady war policy corresponding to Germany's actual situation. Already on September 15, he had a first brief discussion about the war situation with the Chancellor v. Bethmann Hollweg, who was also present at the Great Headquarters, and the Secretary of State of the Foreign Office, v. Jagow. General v. Falkenhayn and the political leadership of the Reich left no doubt about his serious view of the general war situation; although there was \"no reason to despair of a satisfactory end to the war,\" the course of the war would, however, be influenced by the events</body>\n<footer>1) See more on p. 520f.</footer>\n", "167": "\n<pageno>542</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>indicating that there was apparently no longer any danger. But without reserves and thus without the prospect of finally repelling the enemy here, the 100 km long army front in the open field could not be held. General v. Fran\u00e7ois had to decide to retreat to the L\u00f6tzen-Angerapp position, where he could manage for a longer time even with limited forces. The retreat was associated with the abandonment of East Prussian territory, which was particularly difficult for the current commanding general of the K\u00f6nigsberg Army Corps, whose troops had fought and suffered in three major battles and numerous smaller skirmishes for the defense of their immediate homeland since the beginning of the war. But General v. Fran\u00e7ois also saw no other possibility. On the evening of November 2, he reported to the Commander-in-Chief East: \"Attack today in the Rominter Heide area successfully continued. In recent days, around 3000 prisoners taken, four machine guns captured \u2014 transport of the three divisions begins on the evening of November 6. ... Due to transport, it is impossible to protect the East Prussian border. Gradual retreat initially required behind Angerapp. Artillery ammunition constantly scarce.\"\nOn the evening of November 2, the retreat movement began on the southern flank of the army, undisturbed by the enemy.\ne) The Russian Operations in October\u00b9) and Evaluation of the German Operations.\nFor this, see Map 17, Sketches 12, 13, and 14.\nOn October 1, the Russian Supreme Command ordered the crossing of the 2nd Army and the Warsaw Division, henceforth called the \"Narew Group,\" from the Northwest Front to the Southwest Front; these army units were to participate in the large encirclement operation on the Vistula\u00b2). For the same task, the II Siberian Corps of the 10th Army was already moving towards Warsaw. Two more corps were to follow this corps; General Ruzski, after some hesitation, designated the II and IV Corps, which had previously stood behind the 1st Army in the second line. Finally, he was also to move the VI Corps, which, assigned to the 10th Army, was located at Grajewo at the most promising point of the attack front, from there to Lomsha and westward, to close the gap between the 10th and 2nd Army.\nGeneral Ruzski thus ordered further operations against East-</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Continuation on p. 525. \u2014 \u00b2) Cf. p. 458.</footer>\n", "094": "\n<pageno>469</pageno>\n<header>Negotiations with the Allies.</header>\n<body>To be sure, General Ludendorff on October 17 also obtained the personal opinion of a German General Staff officer assigned to General v. Freytag regarding the Austro-Hungarian attack intentions. The respondent, Captain H\u00e4fke, considered \"gradual progress of the entire Austrian offensive likely,\" but the decision would \"only be achieved after heavy and prolonged fighting; therefore, the timing is not foreseeable,\" as they were everywhere facing strongly entrenched Russian positions with too weak artillery of their own. The hope that the Austro-Hungarian offensive in Galicia could soon bring a victory and thus relief for the German 9th Army had to be abandoned. Slow pushing forward or merely holding was not sufficient given the overall situation.\nMeanwhile, the situation at the German front had developed as follows:\nAt the Vistula below Ivangorod, Russian attacks that began on October 14 and were renewed daily had stalled in the swamp and mire of the lowlands and in the German defensive fire, just as the German attacks had previously. Only local skirmishes had taken place, in which the 3rd Guard Division occasionally captured 1000 prisoners on October 16. Otherwise, the combat activity was mainly limited to the artillery on both sides. Since October 18, however, their activity on the German side also had to be restricted due to a shortage of ammunition. The fact that the Russian bridge at Pawlowitze had become unusable for probably two days due to hits from the German 10 cm guns firing with aerial observation could not be exploited given the overall circumstances. The enemy had increasingly reinforced; they were reckoning with six Russian divisions (XVII Corps, III Caucasian Corps, 75th and 81st Reserve Division) on the left bank against only 2\u00bd German divisions of General v. Gallwitz. Thus, one had to be satisfied if it was possible to prevent further advances by the enemy. The extremely unfavorable weather and ground conditions favored the defense but also posed almost superhuman demands on the mental and physical forces of the German defenders. Their losses had grown to about 4000 men, perhaps more, since the beginning of the fighting at this location. North of the Guard Reserve Corps, the reinforced 72nd Infantry Brigade of the XX Army Corps had been at Ryschtynow on October 14 at noon</body>\n", "023": "\n<pageno>12</pageno>\n<header>Fundamental Decisions for Overall War Conduct.</header>\n<body>at the Marne and in Galicia completely uncertain\u201c). Regarding the details of General v. Falkenhayn's communications, State Secretary v. Jagow telegraphed on the same day to a German foreign representation; he first mentioned the victories in the East, against more than double superiority, and then continued: \u201c...In the West, the French have launched a counterattack along the entire front, especially against the right wing of the German armies. The battle is ongoing! It is unlikely that the French could gain any advantages in the front. Even on the right wing, a temporary success of the French would not achieve more than that this wing would be withdrawn to the already advancing, very significant reinforcements. The general situation of the combatants is such that a final decision cannot be expected in the coming weeks.\u201d\nIn a meeting apparently held a few days later with the Chancellor, General v. Falkenhayn outlined the significance of the course of previous operations on the western theater of war. The result of this discussion was reflected in a letter from the Chancellor dated September 19 to the Undersecretary of State in the Foreign Office, Zimmermann, who remained in Berlin. It initially provided an explanation for the withdrawal of the German front; then it continued: \u201cThe resulting enemy superiority required the withdrawal of our right army wing, necessitating the withdrawal of the entire army ... All enemy offensives against the new front have been repelled ... The overall situation, as long as no decision has been made, is naturally serious, but by no means to be judged pessimistically. The actual significance of our initial successes was probably overestimated ... In the first phase of the war, it was possible, while repelling the enemy offensive but without destroying the enemy armies, to relocate the entire theater of war into enemy territory. Now, in the second phase, we have likewise repelled the enemy offensive so far, but it continues, and it will take time before we can proceed to the offensive again on a larger scale ...\u201d\nIn accordance with the seriousness of the situation, the leading statesman intensified his efforts to strengthen his own fighting power by gaining new allies, but otherwise to maintain the neutrality of the previously neutral states.</body>\n<footer>1) Falkenhayn, a. a. D. S. 20.</footer>\n", "021": "\n<pageno>10</pageno>\n<header>Fundamental Decisions for Overall War Leadership.</header>\n<body>Taking office did not leave his staff unimpressed. What the next few days demanded of him was extraordinary: despite the initial uncertainty in mastering leadership tasks, he had to push through to new, creative operational decisions and, in contrast to the previous loose reins of the Supreme Army Command, assert a clear and strong leadership will.\nA few days of intense work sufficed for him to gain the necessary overview of the military situation and establish the required leadership with the other departments of the Great Headquarters. His experiences in assessing responsible personalities and knowledge, which he already possessed as Minister of War, were of significant benefit. His integration into the new position was greatly facilitated by the fact that from the beginning he found not only a strong support in the Military Cabinet but also had the full confidence of his supreme warlord. The Kaiser was not unimpressed by the personality of his new Chief of General Staff, especially by the courage with which he stepped into the breach at a critical moment. His special relationship of trust with the new head of operations could, however, in time give him a public superiority over the other advisors to the crown, especially since the unification of the two most significant military offices in the hands of General v. Falkenhayn conferred an overwhelming power.\nGeneral v. Falkenhayn believed he could not do without active support of land warfare by the navy, especially through submarines. Although the guidelines given for naval warfare did not initially anticipate the use of the high seas fleet\u00b9) and a balance of the situation was not to be hoped for, he nevertheless urged as early as September 15th with the Chief of the Admiralty Staff, Admiral v. Pohl, for the immediate use of submarines to disrupt English troop transports to the mainland. The activity of these boats would have been greatly facilitated if the German leadership had already laid hands on the ports and bases of the Belgian and northern French coast during the first weeks of the war while advancing through Belgium and northern France. As long as there was hope of decisively defeating the Franco-English forces, such considerations had no place, and the coastal land would then have fallen into German hands by itself.

Thus, on October 16, they pushed back a German company defending a\nriver section at Jefiorna, where they had strengthened themselves. The attempt to\nrepel the Russians here on October 18 through an attack by the reinforced 87th Infantry Brigade,\nincluding the Austrian 1/2 3rd Cavalry Division, under\nMajor General v.

Rodt, was assigned the\nGerman 8th Cavalry Division. The cavalry corps thus formed drove the enemy out of Sochaczew again on October 18,\nbut the Russian cavalry did not retreat north from there, but\nhad, as could be determined with certainty, moved southwest to\nLowitsch and thus remained deep in the flank of the German troops.\nDuring these days of highest tension, General v. Mackensen\nwas significantly supported in his decisions and execution by his aviators.\nThey had been able to report on October 16, under favorable weather conditions, that the area west of the Blonje\u2014\nNowogeorgiewsk line was free of the enemy. On October 17, General\nv. Mackensen had to prepare the subordinate leaders confidentially for the impending retreat based on the secret directive\nof the army high command from that day, because he knew\nnow five to six Russian corps were in front of the 45 km long front of his\nforces, which were only 2\u00bd corps strong.

He believed that the most effective way to fulfill the task of covering the rear and right flank of the Vistula operation with these forces was to continue the attack once begun. He accepted that this had to be conducted essentially frontally, as on the flank of the German front south of Lyck, apart from cavalry, only the 11th Siberian Division of the I Turkestan Corps was available.\nThe attempt at Suwalki, whose evacuation was only recognized early on October 3, to decisively encircle larger parts of the German army, led to four corps of the 1st and 10th Armies crowding into a narrow space. General Russki wanted to resume the advance from the line Wladislawow\u2014Suwalki\u2014Augustowo on October 7, due to reasons presumably related to losses and frictions. Assuming that the Germans would continue their retreat to the line of the Masurian Lakes, he thought to reach the line Insterburg\u2014Arys\u2014Johannisburg and south by October 11, to then attack the entire position comprehensively from north and south simultaneously. However, this did not happen.\nAs the Germans held at the border, heavy new battles erupted here from October 5. North of the Rominter Heide, the 1st Army under General v. Rennenkampf was set for attack, except for the XXVI (Reserve) Corps, which was withdrawn south to support the 10th Army.

However, as early as October 8, the Russian XX Corps followed the XXVI south, and the III Corps remained in the prepared German positions, the pressure against the southern flank and the center of the Below Corps soon subsided. In contrast, since October 10, the 53rd Reserve Division from Kowno intervened in the north for support. Here the battle surged back and forth.

This removed General Ru\u00dfki from the task of solving the issue against East Prussia. He immediately took the I Turkestan and the VI Corps from the 10th Army to reinforce the Narew Group. The resulting large gap was gradually filled by shifts within the 10th and 1st Armies. The advance of the German XXV Reserve Corps against Grajewo therefore encountered only relatively weak resistance.\nWhen the general Russian attack on the Vistula began on October 20, the offensive in East Prussia was also to be resumed. General Ru\u00dfki instructed the now reinforced 10th Army from the 1st Army to continue the attack in the previous direction. The objections of General Sievers, who advocated a reversal at the Masurian Lakes Front in the south, were dismissed. Under pressure from the Supreme Command and General Ru\u00dfki, the attack had to begin on October 22 by advancing against the German XXV Reserve Corps at Grajewo. The III Siberian Corps, which had meanwhile been shifted to this flank and reinforced to 3\u00bd divisions, pushed back the German covering troops, a reinforced brigade of the 50th Reserve Division, without difficulty.

The rather unfortunate course of the German operations in France and the Austro-Hungarian ones in Galicia, as well as the situation in Serbia around mid-September, had to have a significant influence on the further decisions of Turkey and the Balkan states and seriously jeopardize the negotiations that seemed so promising. Just a few days after the retreat of the Austro-Hungarian armies, the German ambassador in Constantinople, Baron von Wangenheim, had to report to Berlin: \"Meanwhile, details about the Austrian defeat in Galicia have become known. Added to this is the tremendous impact of the French offensive, while one was already counting on the fall of Paris ... Enver is becoming more isolated with his war plan daily, even among the officers. There is doubt whether Germany will win. (Jzzet Pasha1) said to Liman2): \"We stand firm with you, but you cannot demand a suicide sacrifice from us ... If you win somewhere, so that we can believe in your ultimate success, then Bulgaria and we will move.\" Similarly serious were the reports from Bucharest, where, due to the retreat of the right German army wing before Paris, one was already considering the possibility of a final German defeat. On September 15, it was reported that Russia had offered Romania the southern part of Transylvania, and the next day the Romanian border was closed for the previously permitted material and ammunition transports from Germany to Turkey.\nThe serious voices of the responsible diplomatic foreign representatives showed impressively how much the success of efforts to gain new allies depended above all on the further development of the military situation.\nFrom the beginning, General von Falkenhayn intended to inform the German public about the true events in the Battle of the Marne and during the subsequent retreat in an unreserved manner. Only towards the end of September did the military situation at the front, in his view, allow the execution of this intention. On September 28, he sent to the Foreign Office in Berlin for dissemination through Turkey.</body>\n<footer>1) Until January 1914, predecessor of Enver Bey as War Minister.\n2) Marshal Liman von Sanders was the head of the German military mission in Turkey.</footer>\n", "098": "\n<pageno>473</pageno>\n<header>Preparation for the Deployment of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army.</header>\n<body>\nThe completely changed conditions made it impossible for him to comply with Conrad's wishes. He could only secure the indispensable reinforcements against Warsaw if the German southern flank (1/2 XI Army Corps and Landwehr Corps) at the Vistula was relieved by allied forces.\nGeneral v. Conrad could not escape the compulsion of this situation, as the Russians also seemed to be shifting more and more forces from the area above Ivangorod northwards. He took over the Vistula security above Ivangorod, which now required minimal forces. Less combat-capable Landsturm units took over the protection here, so that for the attack at Ivangorod, the originally envisaged number of seven infantry divisions was ultimately available; the X Corps, still deployed at the San, could not arrive in time anyway. By October 19, the relief of the German troops was so far advanced that only Austro-Hungarian units stood south of Ivangorod. The German XI Army Corps, including its detached parts, and the Landwehr Corps were to march northwest to join the troops of General v. Mackensen1).\nAt the headquarters of the German 9th Army, the planned operation at Ivangorod was still considered unpromising2), but efforts were made to help as much as possible. The fiercely contested and blood-soaked ground of the western Vistula bank on both sides of Ivangorod from Kasimierz to Pilica had to be cleared to free the battlefield for the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army. On the morning of October 19, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg asked General v. Conrad what mission this army had and whether the start of their attack could be expected on October 21; it was intended to withdraw the Guard Reserve Corps on the night of that day, with the southern flank moving towards Radom. General v. Conrad replied that on October 21, the space for the advance of the 1st Army would still be too limited, as the southern flank of the German Guard Reserve Corps, as he heard, could only reach Politcze by that day. To capture strong enemy forces, it seemed advisable \"to give more space westwards for the attack of the 1st Army; thereafter, coordination in action between the Army High Command 9 and the 1st Army Command will need to be established.\"\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) p. 485f. \u2014 2) p. 466f.\n</footer>\n", "026": "\n<pageno>15</pageno>\n<header>The German public opinion remains unaware of the significance of the retreat at the Marne.</header>\n<body>Wolff's Telegraph Office provided a detailed report, in which, after outlining the military operations on all battlefields, it candidly admitted the retreat from the Marne and the unfavorable situation on the western front.

As a result, the German public remained unaware of the great significance, particularly the far-reaching operational impacts of the Battle of the Marne, for a long time.</body>\n", "024": "\n<pageno>13</pageno>\n<header>Influence of the Military Situation on the Policy of the Reich Leadership.</header>\n<body>Since the outbreak of war, efforts had been made to persuade Romania to fulfill its existing alliance obligations and, if possible, to unite with Bulgaria and Greece into a solid Balkan bloc, to which Turkey was to join as a fourth ally, to fight against Russia and Serbia. Such a policy seemed facilitated by the alliance proposals already made by Bulgaria and the Porte on July 24 and 28, 1914, in Berlin, although the existing antagonisms between the two states from the last Balkan War at least made an understanding difficult. However, Turkey had concluded a formal alliance treaty with Germany on August 2, 1914. The prospects offered here for gaining new allies in the fight against the eastern opponents were suddenly thwarted by England's obviously hostile stance against the Central Powers and by Italy's declaration of neutrality. The attitude of England and Greece, with its long, sea-threatened coastlines, towards unconditional neutrality, and Italy's behavior tipped the scales in Bucharest to remain neutral for the time being. Both also influenced Turkey's stance; instead of immediately entering the war on the side of the Central Powers according to the alliance treaty concluded on August 2, the Ottoman Empire declared its provisional armed neutrality on August 3. Bulgaria had also delayed the already begun alliance negotiations despite pressure from the German government. It was evident that both Romania and Bulgaria, as well as Turkey, were determined to await the first war decisions before taking final steps; for Turkey, compelling military reasons spoke in favor, especially the currently insufficient war readiness. Subsequently, the Central Powers, exploiting the initially favorable developing military situation, did not relent in their efforts to persuade Turkey, Romania, and Bulgaria to join them. Despite initial disagreements between the involved political and military authorities over the question of deploying the potential new reinforcements and despite some fluctuations, by early September it had been possible to establish agreement that, if the policy of gaining new allies were to succeed, Turkey and Romania would have to deploy their main forces against Russia, while Bulgaria should turn against Serbia to relieve Austria-Hungary from the fight against its main opponent, Russia.

Extremely unfavorable weather: snowfall in the Carpathians, rain, swollen watercourses, and bottomless roads hindered the advance. The artillery inferiority compared to the Russians was further exacerbated by difficulties in ammunition supply and replacement.\nWhen the attempts of the 4th Army to cross the San upstream failed, General v. Conrad abandoned the attack over the San on October 17 and switched to defense there. At the same time, the prospect of decisive successes for the 3rd and 2nd Armies shifted from day to day. The 2nd Army defended its right flank only with difficulty against Russian counterattacks, while the 3rd was firmly positioned against the previous encirclement positions of the Russians in front of the eastern front of Przemysl. The hope of General v. Conrad that the attack of the Austro-Hungarian army in the south would halt the enemy's advance over the Vistula in the north was not fulfilled.\nIn view of the stalemate in their own attack and the simultaneous severe threat to the German left wing near Warsaw, the Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff had already had the impression since October 14 that a complete change in the overall situation was being prepared, which would also necessitate a new operational plan. \"The direct support of the 9th Army came to the forefront.\" Three days later, he wrote to General v. Bolfras: \"... Now we have no choice but to intervene to relieve the Germans, as their possible defeat would also be a severe disadvantage for us.\" For this task, he intended to deploy the 1st Army as cohesively and uniformly as possible, after having - according to his already mentioned plan - given the Russians at Iwangorod the Vistula crossing; the X Corps and three cavalry divisions were to follow the remaining parts of the army northwards. Moreover, General v. Conrad had hoped that the German troops on the Vistula above Iwangorod would also remain there so that the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army could carry out the attack without any diversion of forces under their flank protection. Such retention of German troops above Iwangorod had also been envisaged by Colonel General v. Hindenburg on October 16, as it was still about the deployment of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army against Warsaw.

In doing so, the XXVI, II Caucasian, XXII Corps and half of the III Siberian Corps charged against the positions of the German I Army Corps and the Morgen Corps, the other half of the III Siberian Corps and the mass of the I Turkestan Corps along with stronger cavalry turned against the almost completely unprotected German southern flank. Nevertheless, the Russians only reached Lyk on October 7, their 4th Cavalry Division reached Bialla. In the meantime, however, their frontal attacks, as they were not conducted uniformly, despite almost double superiority, collapsed under heavy losses; the commander-in-chief of the army had been replaced by General Sievers on October 6. However, even he did not succeed in advancing further in the frontal attack. By October 10, losses in some regiments had risen to 75% of officers and 50% of men. The railway could hardly manage the evacuation of the masses of wounded, although their own supply had been suspended for four days. The horses had long been barely getting any oats; the corps complained they could not harness half of their artillery.\nOn October 10, General Russki decided to halt the offensive, although on that very day the I Turkestan Corps had come from Lyk to Marggrabowa, the 4th Cavalry Division to Urtsch. They were deep in the enemy's flank here and only needed to march further north to get behind the German front, between it and the lake positions. Such an advance could have been carried out with the involvement of the VI Corps with five infantry divisions and would have encountered hardly any significant resistance at that time, as the German XXV Reserve Corps had not yet arrived. The restraint of the Russian leadership saved the German 8th Army from disaster in those days.\nThe mentioned difficulties of the attack can only partially explain its cessation. The decisive factor was probably given by the Supreme Army Command, which did not want to leave strong forces on the East Prussian front, while the concern for Warsaw and the thought of the new major offensive over the middle Vistula fully occupied them. The German-spread reports about rolling towards East Prussia</body>\n", "099": "\n<pageno>474</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>By the morning of October 20, it became clear that the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army intended to launch its attack on October 22 with the left wing over Jedlnia towards Kosienice. They wished for the Guard Reserve Corps to clear the front accordingly and prepare to participate in the attack at Glowatschow and southwards. When a corresponding order from the German Army High Command reached the Guard Reserve Corps at 9 a.m. on October 20, preparations for the retreat to Radom were already underway. The left of the corps front, particularly disadvantageously situated in the marshy terrain east of Kosienice, had been withdrawn to this location the previous night. The general march was to take place the following night and continue on October 21 in the direction of Radom\u2014Jedlnia1). When the Army High Command, in accordance with the wishes of the allies, demanded that the corps be positioned with the main forces at Glowatschow, and otherwise south of this place by the evening of October 21 to attack on the 22nd, General v. Gallwitz decided to assemble the corps on the left bank of the Radomka in the line Jedlnia\u2014Glowatschow. However, this required a retreat oblique to the previously northeast-facing front; the often marshy Radomka ground with few inadequate and unreliable bridges had to be crossed. General v. Gallwitz saw no possibility of executing this movement on the groundless forest paths, especially at night, given the likely pursuing enemy. Only the left wing, the 3rd Guard Infantry Division, could reach the left Radomka bank in time, while the right wing had to divert via Radom. Additionally, the corps was so exhausted after uninterrupted eleven-day battles under difficult weather and terrain conditions that it urgently needed a day of rest before it could attack again. The Army High Command could not ignore such considerations. It deemed a rapid advance of the Russians unlikely anyway and accordingly changed its directive that the Guard Reserve Corps should clear the front for the Austrians on October 21; on the 22nd, it should \"concentrate in the area of Glowatschow and southwards to be ready on October 23 to participate in an Austrian offensive against the Russians, should they advance over the Vistula.\" Consequently, General v. Gallwitz organized the retreat movement so that by the evening of October 21, the 1st Guard Reserve Division should be accommodated at Radom, and the 3rd Guard Infantry Division northeast of it on the left</body>\n<footer>1) 40 to 50 km march.</footer>\n", "244": "\n<pageno>61</pageno>\n<header>Troop Movements of the Enemy on the Western Front.</header>\n<body>\nRailway Lines\nor\nMarch Routes\nUnloading Locations\nUnloading Time\nor\nCompletion\nof\nMovement\nRemarks\n\u00c9pinal\u2014Chalendrey\u2014\nChaumont\u2014Joinville\u2014\nBlesme\u2014Sommesous\u2014\nCh\u00e2lons\u2014Noizy\u2014Pantin\nDunkirk\nMontdidier\nN\u0153ux les Mines\nZeebrugge\nOstend\nArea Soissons\nand Compi\u00e8gne\nPierrefonds\nHazebrouck\nAbbeville\nSt. Omer\nCherbourg\nDunkirk\nSt. Omer\nMourmelon le Grand\nArea St. Omer\u2014\nHazebrouck\nFurnes\nArea Cassel\nArea Berguette\nArea Dunkirk\nArea Calais\n7. 10.\n8. 10.\n14. 10.\n7. 10.\n8. 10.\n14. 10.\n?\n30. 10.\n8. 10.\n12. 10.\n9. 10.\n10. 10.\n11. 10.\n17. 10.\n20. 10.\n21. 10.\n23. 10.\nbetween\n20. and 29. 10.\n29. 10.\n29. 10.\nfrom there by motor vehicle\nto Furnes.\nNoizy\u2014Pantin\u2014La Plaine\n\u2014\u00c9pluches\u2014Creil\u2014\nAmiens\u2014Calais\nas 42nd Inf.

General Sievers anticipated the arrival of further German reinforcements and wanted to halt the attack to await replacements and ammunition. There seemed to be hope for success on the northern flank. The 1st Independent Cavalry Brigade had reached the national border north of Wladislawow, and the Gurko Cavalry Corps was in the area north of Lake Wischtyter; there was hope to encircle the German northern group stationed at Wirballen. General Sievers ordered the continuation of the attack for the III and XX Corps. The extreme northern flank advanced slightly on October 31 at Wladislawow, but the attack of the III Corps against the positions of the German Corps Below hardly developed at all. Gurko's cavalry retreated before the German 1st Cavalry Division. The XX Corps slowly advanced in the southeastern part of the Rominten Heath. On November 1, General Sievers continued the attack. However, he did not make significant progress on that day or the following day. The official Russian account of this section of the campaign in East Prussia concludes with the statement: \"The struggle of the Germans against the Russians, who were almost always in double numerical superiority, shows all the characteristics of German tactics. The Russian operations, since General Sievers took command, were conducted slowly but consistently, step by step towards the goal.\" This approach was recognized by the commander-in-chief of the Northwestern Front.\nThe German 8th Army succeeded in keeping the Russians off East Prussian soil until the end of October. Considerable enemy superiority was tied up at East Prussia's eastern border; their losses from futile assaults were severe. However, neither General v. Fran\u00e7ois nor General v. Schubert managed to achieve a decisive victory. All attempts to dictate terms to the enemy and keep the operation mobile soon led back to a stalemate. General v. Fran\u00e7ois attacked the Russian center. Perhaps a rigid defense along the numerous lake lines in the south and an attack with concentrated force against the relatively weak Russian northern flank would have brought better success and also spared the German troops more. Such an attack had already been prepared by General v. Schubert before he was recalled, and Generals Otto v. Below and v. Morgen had proposed it several times.

Behind it, the 22nd Infantry Division of the XI Army Corps, which had already fought a brigade with the Guard Reserve Corps, was to reach the area west of Radom according to a command from the High Command, so that it could be on the move the next day if necessary.\nOn the evening of October 20, in pitch-black night, the German troops withdrew from their positions in front of Iwangorod and at Kozienice, which they had held for almost ten days in heavy and costly fighting. The light beams of the searchlights from Iwangorod and the disruptive fire of long-range Russian guns accompanied them.\nThe Austro-Hungarian 1st Army under General of the Cavalry Dankl was to be ready for attack on the evening of October 21 with the V and I Corps, a total of six infantry divisions1), in a line extending from the Altanka estuary, southwest past Swolen, to the railway 15 km east of Radom. Behind the center of this front, the 43rd Infantry Division was to stand as a reserve at Ilza. In connection with the right wing, Austrian Landsturm, 35th Brigade, and 106th Division secured at the Vistula. The additional forces, X Corps and three cavalry divisions, which were to advance from the San, were held back there at the last moment, as the Russians had managed to cross a river section previously considered impassable during the flood and establish themselves on the left bank.\nBut even without the intended reinforcement, which could only have come into effect later, General Dankl had a considerable force in his seven infantry divisions, which since September 9, for six weeks, had undertaken larger marches but had not had to endure any more serious battles. The losses were minimal.\nOn the morning of October 21, General Dankl informed the German High Command of his attack decision. At that time, he was still unaware that the Guard Reserve Corps would not be ready to attack until October 23.

The Austro-Hungarian army was still struggling for decision at Lemberg at this time, while the German 8th Army in East Prussia, after the destruction of the Narew Army at Tannenberg, had turned against the Russian Njemen Army. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg hoped to strike them so decisively through the initiated encirclement that he could then turn south against the Narew to bring the allies the support promised to them in peacetime and repeatedly requested since the beginning of operations. On the night of September 10th, the Russian Njemen Army began to retreat; General v. Rennenkampf avoided the decision in East Prussia before he could be decisively defeated. Generaloberst v.

Since for weeks there had been a business overload \nwith the enemy along the entire front, there had been neither relief from the front line nor \nrest.\nIn tenacious defense of the homeland, active, reserve, \nand landwehr units, replacement troops, landsturm, and newly formed formations, \nmostly consisting of young volunteers, gave their best. That the overwhelming enemy \ncould only occupy insignificant German border areas by early November remains their merit \nand that of the strong-willed and tirelessly active army leadership of General \nv. Schubert to General v. Francois. The delay the enemy suffered \nat the border provided the time to expand the L\u00f6tzen-Angerapp position \ninto a strong bulwark, so that the defense there could be carried out with \nminimal forces in the future.\nReliable information on the German business losses could not be determined, \nbut an approximate calculation suggests 15,000 to \n20,000 men. Opposed to this were \u2014 in addition to the heavy bloody losses \nof the Russians \u2014 about 20,000 prisoners and about 50 guns as booty.</body>\n", "101": "\n<pageno>476</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>that the V and I Corps were to launch an attack on the morning of October 22nd, with the left wing of the I Corps advancing through Jedlnia at 8 a.m. and further along the main road towards Kosienice. The order for the attack further stated: \"The Guard Reserve Corps, which is stationed at and south of Glowacz\u00f3w, will be deployed as soon as a battlefront forms, to engage the western flank... (followed by information on reinforcements of the Austrian 43rd Infantry Division)... The battle is to be conducted according to the general war situation in such a way that the Russians are defeated by the end of October 22nd.\"\nWhile General Dankl was thus determined to carry out the thrust against the Vistula with full force on October 22nd, the German 9th Army's high command still doubted that decisive battles would occur on that day. According to reports available by the evening of October 21st, the enemy was only following with advance troops at a great distance. At 6 p.m., Generaloberst von Hindenburg ordered: \"The Guard Reserve Corps will be positioned tomorrow in echelon to the left, west of the Radomka, ready to support the Austrians (\u2014 presumably on October 23rd).\" However, the task of the Guard Reserve Corps had become even more difficult, as other Russian forces were reported to be advancing against the rear of the designated deployment area, from Gorakalwaria along the Vistula and also from the north towards Warka against the Pilitza sector. There, the XX Army Corps, together with the Austrian-Hungarian 3rd Cavalry Division under its command, covered a wide area. This division was positioned opposite Warka on the southern Pilitza bank, with the XX Army Corps itself to the left of it on the main road Radom\u2014Grojec and even further west. For all eventualities, Generaloberst von Hindenburg had also held the 22nd Infantry Division of the XI Army Corps, united at Radom, as a reserve group for October 22nd. The Austro-Hungarian army commander looked forward to the impending attack of his troops with confidence. General Dankl did not doubt a successful outcome and therefore informed the German high command on the evening of October 21st that he had received instructions from his army command to \"participate in the operations of the 9th Army on their eastern flank\" following a successful advance against Iwangorod. He was already asking for the \"prevailing considerations for this operation\" to align himself in time.</body>\n", "245": "\n<pageno>620</pageno>\n<header>Appendix 3.

This left, against the German 8th Army without the garrison of the Njemen fortresses (presumably three reserve divisions), a total of 17 infantry divisions and 8 cavalry divisions. The Russian formations, however, were partly of low strength; for example, the 53rd Reserve Division is said to have had only 7000 (instead of 16000) rifles. General Siewers correctly estimated his opponent at seven divisions plus some Landwehr and Landsturm brigades. The Supreme Army Command demanded the continuation of the offensive by October 27 at the latest. However, General Siewers felt capable of this only after a comprehensive regrouping of his forces, despite double numerical superiority. On October 28, he ordered that the attack should proceed: north of Lake Wischtwyter the III Corps and the three-division strong cavalry corps Gutro, south of it the XX and the II Caucasian Corps, with the latter being directed from Suwalki in a generally westerly direction; further south, the XXII and XXVI (Reserve) Corps were to hold their positions; the III Siberian Corps was to seize \"the area of the Gr. Selment Lake.\" The following day, the Supreme Army Command assigned the army the task of breaking the Russian resistance and clearing the way to the lower Vistula; General Ru\u00dfki was instructed to act on the 10th Army in this sense.\nOn the morning of October 29, the attack was to begin. However, on this morning north of Lake Wischtwyter, the III Corps, as it is represented by the Russians, was itself attacked\u00b9); it held its positions. The XX Corps, which encountered the gap in the German formation, slowly advanced south of the lake while fighting; the II Caucasian Corps, however, which had had to defend itself against German attacks during the night, due to exhaustion\u00b2), did not dare to take the offensive, and the III Siberian Corps also did not advance against Pi\u00dfanten.\nOctober 30 brought only slight progress with the XX Corps, and even here only minor advances; at the same time, it became increasingly apparent that the turning</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) In fact, no attack was made there by the German side.\n\u00b2) Korolkow, Overview, p. 105.</footer>\n", "246": "\n<pageno>621</pageno>\n<header>Source References.</header>\n<body>\nGivany (Plieux de Diusse): \"Journal of a Liaison Officer.

From the fortifications there, after the successes achieved in the West against much stronger installations, no significant resistance was expected. Only against Osowiec, which lay off the main thrust over the Narew, was the heaviest artillery required; it was requested from the Supreme Army Command on September 12. Against the other positions, heavy field howitzers and the mortars (21 cm) available in K\u00f6nigsberg sufficed. So now seemed the time for the operation over the Narew to Siedlce, so often requested by the allies, to be more rapid and effective than an advance from Silesia and Posen. The prerequisite, however, was that the Austro-Hungarian army held at the San long enough for the aid from the Narew to become effective behind the Russians. That this prerequisite would be fulfilled was not entirely certain at the German 8th Army's High Command; they had to consult the allied army command. To initiate the new operation, the Guard Reserve Corps was ready as the first larger unit on September 13. Meanwhile, the turn of events in the West had become known. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg therefore, before ordering further actions, inquired at 11 a.m. that day with the Supreme Army Command about how many forces the East could continue to count on, adding: \"for defense in Prussia, three army corps are required.\"</body>\n<body>This inquiry coincided with a decision by the Supreme Army Command, which, based on Austro-Hungarian urging and its own assessment of the situation, had already decided to support the allies' front directly to prevent further retreat. They were to be provided with the two army corps of the 8th Army, which had been reported available for an army to be formed in Silesia on September 10 under different circumstances in East Prussia. However, on September 13 at 1 p.m., the 8th Army had been ordered: \"Immediately free up and prepare two army corps for transport to Krakow. Response on when readiness is possible.\" At the same time, the request for the heaviest artillery against Osowiec was rejected.</body>\n<body>At the 8th Army's High Command, this decision could not be reconciled with the aforementioned own inquiry, and thus they could not form a clear picture of the Supreme Army Command's intentions: Should the two corps go to Krakow alone or be made available to the Austro-Hungarian army command?</body>\n", "102": "\n<pageno>477</pageno>\n<header>The Attack of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army.</header>\n<body>\nto be able to close. If the attack on Ivangorod had the hoped-for success for the allies, there might still be a prospect of cooperation by the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army against Warsaw.\nOn October 22, General Dankl had his 1st Army advance in a front about 35 km wide, with six divisions in the front line and one as a reserve behind the center. The right wing found almost no enemy in front of it, the center gained ground, initially fighting against weaker enemies, but on the left wing, the Austro-Hungarian 12th Infantry Division encountered resistance at Jedlnia early in the morning, which it could not immediately break. The enemy here was estimated to be a brigade. It had entrenched itself at the western edge of the large forest area, which extends 12 km deep from Jedlnia to the northeast towards Kosienice.\nThe first report on the situation at Jedlnia was received by the German Guard Reserve Corps at 11:30 a.m. from the Austrian General of Cavalry Baron von Kirchbach on Lauterbach, the commanding general of the I Corps. The report concluded with the sentence: \"Intervention of the Guard Reserve Corps with a division from the direction of Glownaczow against Stanislawice is desired, so that the enemy brigade can be completely cut off.\" However, at this time, the Guard Reserve Corps was not yet in a position to intervene in the allies' battle with stronger forces. The 3rd Guard Infantry Division had been located at Glownaczow and southwest during the night of October 22. The 1st Guard Reserve Division had orders to move into a bivouac area to the left of the Radomka during the course of the day, extending from Glownaczow to 20 km southwest of this place; the 3rd Guard Division was to close ranks accordingly. When the Austro-Hungarian attack order became known, General von Gallwitz instructed these divisions to ensure that \"orders of the General Command regarding their alert and readiness are always reachable.\" Finally, on the morning of October 22, when reports were available indicating that the enemy had spread out on the right bank of the Radomka up to about 20 km from the Vistula to the west, at 9:45, he ordered the 5th Guard Brigade to be ready at Glownaczow, so that it could support the allies' attack in the direction of Kosienice on special orders, while the 6th Guard Brigade was to take over the protection of the army corps against the north. However, General von Gallwitz did not expect serious fighting on this day. The instruction therefore concluded: \"The order for today is\n</body>\n", "028": "\n<pageno>403</pageno>\n<header>Operation from Silesia or over the Narew?</header>\n<body>but also threatened the Prussian provinces of Silesia and Posen. This danger was not considered very high by the German 8th Army's high command at the time. However, if the Narew operation was no longer possible and the support of the allied army \u2014 as seemed to be the case \u2014 could no longer be postponed, then it had to be carried out from Silesia and Posen. Thus, Major General Ludendorff, as Chief of Staff of the 8th Army, inquired with the supreme army command on the evening of September 10th \u2014 still unaware of the changed situation in the West \u2014 whether further reinforcements could be expected for an army to be formed in Silesia. From East Prussia, which had to be held for military and economic reasons, two army corps could be released. On September 11th, the 8th Army, advancing from the western direction, halted the main reserve of the fortress Posen as the first part; it was to be transported back to the eastern border of the province of Posen and pushed into Poland.\nMeanwhile, the decision at the Galician front had fallen in favor of the allies; thus, German assistance there became even more urgent. On September 11th, the entire Austro-Hungarian army had begun its retreat; the commander-in-chief, Archduke Friedrich, intended to initially repel the enemy at the San\u00b9). Behind this naturally strong section, he could hope, relying on the large fortress of Przemysl and the makeshift bridgeheads of Jaroslaw and Sieniawa, to at least temporarily hold back the Russian superiority and reorganize his own troops. However, the allied army command no longer expected a timely effect from a German operation over the Narew under the changed circumstances. It now saw the only possible help in the direct support through the transport of German troops to Galicia and presented this view to the German supreme army command. The authorized German general at the Austro-Hungarian headquarters, Lieutenant General Freiherr v. Freytag-Loringhoven, who had previously supported the allies' request for the deployment of active German troops to Galicia, joined this view in a telegram to the supreme army command on September 12th.\nHowever, the German 8th Army had meanwhile changed its view on how to assist the allies; for the success over the Russian Njemen army turned out to be much greater than assumed on September 10th. There was not much to fear from this enemy army for the foreseeable future, and in the last few days</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Army order from September 11, 1914, Conrad IV, p. 702.</footer>\n", "174": "\n<pageno>36</pageno>\n<header>C. Considerations on the Overall Operations in the East.</header>\n<body>Including Maps 14 and 17.\nIn mid-September, three Russian armies, heavily defeated in East Prussia, were in retreat, while five Russian armies followed as victors the retreating Austro-Hungarian army in Galicia. At that time, a German offensive from East Prussia over the Narew could probably have achieved great things\u00b9). The urgent calls for help from the allied army command led to the abandonment of this operation. The offensive then begun in southern Poland was hampered from the outset by the fact that it could not \u2014 as desired by Generaloberst v. Hindenburg \u2014 be conducted far removed from the Austro-Hungarian flank towards Ivangorod and Warsaw. Warsaw, with its railways and Vistula bridges, soon proved to be the key to the entire Russian Vistula front. The danger threatening the northern flank of the German 9th Army could, as the situation developed further, only be countered by a swift and decisive victory, which the Austro-Hungarian army, relieved by the German advance, then had to achieve alone. The circumstances had developed such that the decision depended on the success of the materially weaker part of the joint front.\nThe following comparison of the strength ratios in the East on October 1 and October 26 by divisions\u00b2) shows how the Russian masses concentrated along the middle Vistula during the month of October:</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) See p. 434.\n\u00b2) Among the Central Powers, all active reserve and Landwehr (Austro-Hungarian \"Landsturm\") units are included, but not the German Landsturm; among the Russians, only active and reserve units are counted. Independent brigades are counted as half divisions. The Russian infantry divisions averaged 16 battalions and 48 guns, the German and Austro-Hungarian divisions only exceptionally more than 12 battalions, with the German divisions averaging 72 guns, the Austro-Hungarian divisions averaging 42, and the German reserve and Landwehr divisions at most 36.</footer>\n", "030": "\n<pageno>405</pageno>\n<header>Operation from Silesia or over the Narew?</header>\n<body>be done? However, there were concerns. If German forces were sent for the immediate support of the allies, they were desired to be strong enough not only to support the Austro-Hungarian army but also to give it the impetus for a new offensive. Only through attack was it possible to continue to resist the Russian superiority in the vast fields of the East. In East Prussia, where the success against Rennenkampf was expanding to ever greater extent, it was eventually possible to manage with even fewer forces than had been considered necessary for this theater of war just a few days earlier. Then four army corps and a cavalry division could be freed up to support the allies. However, if these units were to be moved to Galicia in full strength, a lot of time would have to pass under the unfavorable Austrian railway conditions before they became effective, more time in any case than with an operation over the Narew. Whether the allied army would be able to hold the San line until then was questionable. Under such circumstances, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg saw it as his duty to also present this view to the German army command, and on the same evening, on September 13 at 9:20, he telegraphed to Lemberg: \"Offensive against Narew in decisive direction possible in about ten days. Austria, however, requested direct support due to Romania by relocating the army to Krakow and Upper Silesia. Available are four army corps and a cavalry division. Rail transport takes about 20 days. Long marches to the Austrian left wing. Help arrives there too late. Request decision. Army must retain independence there in any case.\"\nThe Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff, General of Infantry Baron Conrad v. H\u00f6tzendorf, had assigned his wing adjutant, Captain in the General Staff Fleischmann v. Theiszruf, to the command of the German 8th Army and was therefore constantly informed about the views and intentions of Generaloberst v. Hindenburg. Thus, General v. Conrad had already emphasized in a telegram to the German Supreme Army Command on September 13 at 12:20 noon: \"For further success, especially for direct coverage of Posen and Prussian Silesia, the dispatch of the strongest possible forces via Krakow to the earliest connection to our left wing is urgent. German readiness in Silesia would be far too far back ...\" At about the same time, however, General v. Conrad had informed the Austro-Hungarian representatives at the German Supreme Army Command as well as at the command in</body>\n", "103": "\n<pageno>478</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>\nThe accommodation area of the 3rd Guard Infantry Division is expected to be occupied for the night ...\u201d No new order was issued to the 1st Guard Reserve Division; this division, particularly exhausted, only began to march in groups to their new accommodation area in the later morning hours.\nInitially, only the intervention of a single German infantry brigade was possible when at 11:00 a.m. the mentioned request from General v. Kirchbach was received. The decision to immediately send this brigade from Glownaczhno southeast to strike over the Radomka to Stanislawice, to cut off the Russians at Jedlnia, was already shaken by other reports. The enemy had reached Ryczywol at the mouth of the Radomka with some battalions coming from the north. Furthermore, a report received at 11:15 a.m. from the army high command stated that the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Cavalry Division reported a bridge over the Vistula between the mouths of the Radomka and Pilitza and Russian occupation at Warka on the Pilitza. The high command itself was at this time just about to move from Radom to the new army headquarters at Konsk. Serious concern for the 3rd Guard Division from the east and north was now to be expected. Nevertheless, General v. Gallwitz ordered the attack of the 5th Guard Brigade over B\u0142uska to Stanislawice at 12:00 noon. Immediately thereafter, however, the XX Army Corps reported that the Austro-Hungarian Cavalry Division was no longer opposite Warka as before, but was moving back to a location about 16 km southwest of there. Since it was also reported that the localities on the right bank of the Radomka south of B\u0142uska were already occupied by the enemy, the attack order was withdrawn. General v. Gallwitz hoped, however, to carry out the attack after bringing in the 1st Guard Reserve Division the following day, and wished that the Austro-Hungarian cavalry would again take over the blockade at Warka, where the enemy had not yet set foot on the southern bank of the Pilitza.\nSouth of the Guard Reserve Corps, the battle of the Austro-Hungarian troops continued. By the evening of October 22, the 12th Infantry Division had broken the Russian resistance at Jedlnia; they reported 1200 prisoners. In its entirety, the army of General Dankl had advanced to the line of Vistula Heights west of the Nowo-Alexandria-Boguzin area, 8 km west of Kosienice, intending to continue the attack the following day.

General Dankl had reinforced his left wing, believing the right at the Vistula to be sufficiently secured. However, during the night, the Russians had brought up new forces and now launched their own attack. Heavy fighting began in the center and on the left wing as early as 6:00 a.m.\nBy the time the situation in front of the Guard Reserve Corps was clarified enough for General v. Gallwitz to give the attack order, it was 9:00 a.m. Airmen had identified two battalions marching up the southern Radomka bank from Rzschtykow, while more infantry was still north of the river at Rzschtykow. The enemy at Warta seemed to have turned all parts to the northern Pilitza bank towards the west; however, the Austro-Hungarian Cavalry Division was initially still 15 km southwest of Warta at Stromiez. In this situation, the 3rd Guard Division was ordered to \"support the parts of the Austrian 12th Division fighting at Ursynow and Stanislawow<sup>1</sup> by advancing over Glownatchow to Bzhuja and over Rogoshef to Adamow<sup>2</sup>. The 1st Guard Reserve Division, still located north, was to push north from Glownatchow to take over the cover against the north. Until then, the left wing of the 3rd Guard Division remained bound by covering tasks against Rzschtykow of the Radomka. The attack of this division initially only got underway with the 6th Guard Brigade on the right wing, and only in the afternoon did the left advance. Attacking in a southeasterly direction, the 3rd Guard Division under Lieutenant General Litzmann, their newly appointed commander, drove Russian infantry and artillery from their positions at the forest edges 3 km east of Bzhuja by evening. To their right, the newly established Austrian 43rd Infantry Division had advanced to the same level. However, with these successes, nothing decisive was achieved, but the situation behind the Guard Reserve Corps had become threatening. Although the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Cavalry Division under Field Marshal Lieutenant Ritter v. Brudermann had meanwhile advanced eastwards again and driven back strong Russian cavalry south of Warta, by noon General v. Gallwitz knew from air reports-</body>\n<footer>\n1) Both places not marked on the map; they are about 6 km south of the Radomka bridge from Bzhuja.\n2) Both places not on the map; Rogoshef is 3 km northwest of Glownatchow on the left Radomka bank, Adamow opposite Rogoshef on the right.\n</footer>\n", "031": "\n<pageno>406</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>Ordered East Prussia to immediately request support from four corps and a cavalry division'), which \u2014 as he had heard \u2014 would be available in East Prussia. Captain v. Fleischmann had urged his chief of staff in the evening of the day'), the German 8th Army's high command still intended the Narew operation. He therefore suggested reinforcing the demand for the deployment of German forces in Galicia by immediately sending a telegraphic request to the German Emperor and pointing out the \"utmost possibility of holding\" the San line, as only this seemed to ensure an orderly deployment of the German reinforcements. When this telegraph from Captain v. Fleischmann arrived during the night of September 13 to 14 at the allied army command, which had meanwhile been relocated to Neu-Sandez, the Austro-Hungarian army, with the sole exception of the left wing army, was still east of the San. Whether Archduke Friedrich ever intended to seriously resist in this river section is questionable. His chief of staff, General v. Conrad, reported that the continuation of the retreat depended on the enemy's behavior and the arrival of the requested German reinforcements. As a \"recovery line,\" where he initially wanted to give the troops a rest and reorganize and replenish their severely depleted units and formations, he had initially considered the Dunajec (more than 100 km west of the San), \"in the extreme case the heights of Krakow.\" \"However, if the enemy's sluggish actions allowed for an earlier establishment, this was welcome\"'). The decision to continue the retreat far to the west had become difficult for General v. Conrad. He had expressed to his surroundings at the time that one must separate heart and mind; the heart spoke against retreating, but the mind for it\"). Given the visibly advancing enemy, it seemed impossible to attempt defense at the San any longer; as the left wing army was stripped of all Austro-Hungarian troops, encirclement and encroachment threatened from there).

Falkenhayn's view that the East could only be a holding action for the time being. However, the protection of one's own borders was important for political as well as economic reasons. Furthermore, East Prussia had to be held under all circumstances for purely military reasons, as it presented far superior Russian forces and above all formed an indispensable gateway for future operations. Therefore, when General v. Francois asked for reinforcements on October 8, citing the great enemy superiority, the newly formed XXV Reserve Corps was immediately assigned to him. The justification for such a deployment to hold East Prussia is retrospectively shown by the judgment of the Russian General Danilov. According to him, all Russian intentions to carry the attack \"deep into Germany\" failed mainly because East Prussia, with its well-developed railways for eastern conditions, remained firmly in German hands, threatening any Russian advance to the west in flank and rear. Even when the Russians followed the German 9th Army through Poland, they had to divide their forces. More than a fifth of their army was far off at the East Prussian eastern border, so that the northern wing of the advancing main force was increasingly threatened by German concentrations from East Prussia with every step forward. By the end of October, a gap of more than 200 km wide had opened between it and the left wing of the 10th Army from Plozk to Grajewo, in which only two corps and cavalry stood.\nSince the beginning of October, German and Austro-Hungarian armies have been working shoulder to shoulder on a joint task; it was different from the beginning of the war, when each part had to fulfill its own task spatially far apart from the other. It was clear that a unified command for the German Eastern Front of the Allies would have been necessary. The final reasons why it still did not come about, however, lay \u2014 as in the West with the French and English \u2014 not purely on military grounds and therefore should not be further discussed in this context.\nThe fact that no higher command was created for the two German armies was a deficiency, which was remedied by placing the 8th Army in East Prussia under the command of the 9th Army</body>\n", "104": "\n<pageno>479</pageno>\n<header>The Battle of Ivangorod.</header>\n<body>III. Caucasian Corps as well as the 75th and 81st Reserve Divisions were identified. The Russians had been weak in front of the right flank. Further south, enemy crossing attempts at Josefow had to be repelled, with further attempts of this kind recognized in the afternoon at Kasimierz. In front of the left flank, the enemy held unknown strength in the forest area south and west of Konskiez up to the Radomka. Three bridges at Ivangorod and Pawlowice and now a fourth at Tarnow were available to them for bringing up new forces.\nAt the German Guard Reserve Corps, the enemy had not advanced from the Vistula or the Pilica during the afternoon. The Austro-Hungarian 3rd Cavalry Division, exhausted by marches and security duties, objected to taking over the security at Warka again. When General v. Gallwitz received this report and learned that a Guard Battalion advanced to Bluska had been pushed back over the Radomka by a Russian brigade, he became increasingly doubtful whether the attack to the south would still be possible. As a result of a telephone conversation with the Army High Command, the task of the corps was recorded at 7:45 p.m. with the following keyword: \"Primarily our duty to cover the flank of the Austrians. However, it must not come to the point that the Guard Reserve Corps becomes so entangled in the battle at Ivangorod and Konskiez that it loses its connection to XX.\" This meant a significant restriction of the original attack mission. Around the same time, General v. Gallwitz also learned from the XX Army Corps that the allied 3rd Cavalry Division had orders to \"advance on Warka again tomorrow\"; the enemy was said to be weak there; the right flank of the corps, 41st Infantry Division, at Zielosblhegi, would remain. Regardless, General v. Kirchbach was informed that his left flank, 12th Infantry Division, had orders to advance on Lutschinowo (5 km north-northwest of Konskiez) on October 23. In view of the difficult situation of the Guard Reserve Corps, he added \u2014 with significant restriction of previous wishes: \"Success possible tomorrow if the Guard Reserve Corps opens to the south and defends to the north \u2014 or vice versa...\" General v. Gallwitz now ordered the assembly of his corps for the morning of October 23 at Glowatschow. He reserved the decision on whether to proceed towards Konskiez, Ryschkowol, or Warka until the situation was clarified by aerial reconnaissance the following morning.</body>\n<footer>1) Not marked on the map.</footer>\n", "177": "\n<pageno>552</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>could not be balanced in southern Poland. Since the Supreme Army Command had reserved the right to issue instructions to the 8th Army, its command communicated directly with it. This hindered the influence of the Army High Command 9, which was already overburdened by its own operations and negotiations with the ally and was spatially far separated from the 8th Army. It was completely questioned since the command in East Prussia passed to General v. Fran\u00e7ois on October 4, and he was expressly given full freedom for his operations. The subordination relationship under Generaloberst v. Hindenburg was thus virtually abolished until the Supreme Army Command pointed out during an Austro-Hungarian inquiry on October 20 and then again during the retreat from Poland that it still existed.\nDespite such difficulties, great achievements have been made. Not least, the reputation that German leadership and troops had gained with the enemy since the great victories in East Prussia contributed to this. Only this can explain the caution bordering on anxiety that the Russians observed despite their superiority during the initiation and execution of their great offensive; they gave the Central Powers time for countermeasures that would otherwise have been hardly feasible. However, German leadership and troops accomplished what had to be accomplished at that time. General v. Conrad, who was not entirely in agreement with the operations, wrote under the fresh impression of the unexpectedly rapid advance against the Vistula: \"One must concede to the Germans: they are much tougher in their demands on the troops and ruthlessly extract the utmost from them. This spirit of ruthlessness was already common among them in peacetime, unlike us.\" However, the German troops were able and capable of meeting such high demands; this was primarily where their superiority lay.\nNo widely visible success crowned the German October operations in the East; but the rapid advance of the 9th Army revived the Austro-Hungarian army and, together with the battles of the 8th Army in East Prussia, secured the freedom of action in the West for the German Supreme Army Command until November. More was hardly possible in view of the Russian superiority.</body>\n<footer>1) From a letter to General v. Bolfras dated October 12, 1914 (Conrad V. S. 110).</footer>\n", "032": "\n<pageno>407</pageno>\n<header>The Abandonment of the Narew Operation.</header>\n<body>Already upon reaching the San, the decision matured to abandon any defense of this river line. On the morning of September 14, the Archduke wired the German Emperor: \"The Austro-Hungarian army will only strike the 8th Army in view of the advancing German forces when union with these forces is secured. Operation over Narew is now by no means effective. Only union in West Galicia is considered. I therefore request that transport via Krakow be arranged as soon as possible.\"\nPresumably somewhat simultaneously with this message, a report from General v. Freytag had also arrived at the Great Headquarters in Luxembourg. Although written as early as September 10, before the start of the Austro-Hungarian retreat, it already gave a rather unconfident depiction of the state of the allied army. This \"is not capable of maintaining very high performances on its own for the long term. Therefore, I allowed myself yesterday\" \u2014 it continued \u2014 \"to once again designate the immediate support of the Imperial and Royal Army in Galicia by active German troops, which would provide it with strong backing and fresh courage, as desirable...\"\nWith the wiring of the Archduke, it was decided that the Narew operation was no longer in question for the German army in East Prussia. However, the shift to Krakow desired by General v. Conrad would have led the army behind the retreating Austro-Hungarian front and thus into an unfavorable situation in every respect. Thus, the German Supreme Army Command decided on September 14 at 12 noon in an instruction to the 8th Army Command: \"Operation over the Narew is not considered promising in the current situation of the Austrians. Immediate support of the Austrians is politically necessary. Operations from Upper Silesia are possible. The transfer of troops from the West is not intended. The number of forces to be used in Silesia will be determined later. The independence of the army remains even in joint operations with the Austrians.\"\nIn view of the situation with the allies, the German 8th Army found itself, albeit internally reluctant, with this decision\u2014\n(Conrad IV, p. 796), \"that we, if no German assistance could be expected, would have had to await the enemy behind the San, protected by Przemy\u015bl\" \u2014 is thus already to be denied, but probably reveals a coloring deemed necessary at the time to maintain prestige with the ally.\n1) Nothing certain could be determined.</body>\n", "178": "\n<pageno>275</pageno>\n<header>IV. A Crisis of the Two-Front War.</header>\n<body>At the turn of October/November 1914, a serious crisis had arisen in the conduct of the two-front war. The development of events on the various battlefields forced the leader of the German operations to once again decide with compelling urgency on which battlefield the focus of military actions should be placed.\nIn the West, these had taken a by no means satisfactory course since mid-September. If General v. Falkenhayn initially hoped to bring about a change in the situation on the western battlefield within a few weeks by deploying the 6th Army, which was being transported from the left wing, he was disappointed by the outcome of these operations. On the northern wing, the leadership's efforts on both sides to bring about a decision by encircling the enemy's outer flank had only led to a balance of forces in the first week of October. The hoped-for change in the situation could not be achieved in the first three weeks of Falkenhayn's leadership; above all, it was not possible to deprive the enemy of operational freedom of action.\nThis failure prompted General v. Falkenhayn to make the serious decision to deploy the last reserve of the Supreme Army Command, the newly formed volunteer corps, except for the XXV Reserve Corps assigned to the 8th Army for the protection of East Prussia, in the West, in order to strive for a change in the situation through one last major effort. This decision was facilitated by the fact that operations in the East had so far proceeded as desired. By deploying the newly formed 9th Army in South Poland, it was possible to divert the main Russian forces from the heavily pressured Austro-Hungarian army. The situation in the East thus seemed temporarily secured and did not appear to require immediate support through reinforcements from the West.\nThe situation in the Balkans was also not threatening at this time. Although, as already mentioned, the unfortunate course of operations at the Marne, near Lemberg, and in Serbia had exerted an unfavorable influence on the stance of the Balkan states; particularly Romania's position had become increasingly uncertain since those days.</body>\n", "033": "\n<pageno>408</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>\nThe decision of the Supreme Army Command was pending. However, it was considered necessary to discuss again with them the strength and task of the forces designated to support the allies. If these \u2014 as apparently planned \u2014 marched immediately following the allied army, their advance could at most temporarily halt the enemy's encircling movement, but not lead to a more far-reaching success. For this, one had to advance more detached from the Austro-Hungarian left flank. General Ludendorff presented this line of thought to Generaloberst v. Moltke by telephone on the evening of September 14 and proposed sending the bulk of the 8th Army under its current commander to Upper Silesia and Posen, to initiate a completely new operation from here, detached from the Austro-Hungarian army. Generaloberst v. Moltke promised to examine the proposal; however, the further handling of the matter fell to his successor, Generalleutnant v. Falkenhayn, who had just that evening taken over the representation of the seriously ill current Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army.\nOn the evening of September 15, General v. Falkenhayn informed the High Command of the 8th Army: \"His Majesty orders: A 9th Army will be formed for joint use with the Austrian army under General v. Schubert. Generalmajor Ludendorff will join the staff of the High Command of the 9th Army as Chief of the General Staff...\" For the 9th Army, as it was further stated, according to the closer determination of the High Command 8, initially two army corps, including the Guard Reserve Corps, and a cavalry division were to join. They were to be transported by rail to the Silesian-Polish border, each army corps to Tarnowitz-Beuthen and Lublinitz-Koslerberg, the cavalry division to Kempen in Posen. In addition to these units joining the 9th Army, two more army corps were to be prepared for transport by rail in East Prussia. The 9th Army was, as stated in a simultaneous directive by General v. Schubert, to be advanced \"in agreement with the Austrian commander-in-chief as much as possible against the flank and rear of the nearest reachable Russian forces.\"\nThese orders were supplemented and changed in the following days. From a recent inquiry by Captain v. Fleischmann about the prospects of resistance at the San, General v. Conrad learned.\n1) See S.1. \u2014 2) S. 501, Note 2.\n</body>\n", "106": "\n<pageno>481</pageno>\n<header>The Battle of Ivangorod.</header>\n<body>that besides this opponent, an entire Russian corps at Tarnow was in full transition across the Vistula. His own corps stood with the front facing east, north, and northwest around Zbusha and Glowatschow.\nThe Austro-Hungarian 1st Army had made no significant progress on October 23. The Russian resistance had solidified; the situation of their own right wing had even become quite serious. Here, the enemy, apparently parts of the 70th Reserve Division, had been able to gain a foothold on the left bank of the Vistula from Nowo-Alexandria, and had also begun bridging at Kasimierz. The V Corps under Field Marshal Puhallo v. Brlog had essentially only the Hungarian 37th Infantry Division to deploy against this enemy; the X Corps, which was now marching north, was still far off. It was not possible to push the enemy back across the Vistula by evening. Nevertheless, General Dankl wanted to continue the attack on the entire front the next day. He no longer counted on significant support from the German Guard Reserve Corps given the situation in its rear.\nOctober 24 brought setbacks on both wings of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army. In front of Nowo-Alexandria, the situation temporarily deteriorated so threateningly that General Dankl considered retreat; however, based on the confident reports of his two commanding generals, he postponed the final decision to the next morning. On October 25, the Russian attacks became less frequent and weaker; the enemy was also exhausted from the battles of the last three days. The Austro-Hungarian army was able to hold its positions on this day. General Dankl also wanted to continue the fight on the 26th, after the Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division had meanwhile arrived as reinforcement behind his right wing and the arrival of the foremost division of the X Corps was expected for October 27. On the 29th, the other two divisions of this corps were to follow, with two more cavalry divisions marching behind the center of the front. A suggestion from the German Army High Command for further reinforcement of the allied army before Ivangorod had already been rejected by General v. Conrad on October 24 with the reasoning, \"as a decision in the heavy fortress-like battle south of Przemysl is not yet foreseeable.\"\nThe German Guard Reserve Corps was meanwhile increasingly threatened by the enemy advancing from Rhyshcywol and Warta.</body>\n", "034": "\n<pageno>409</pageno>\n<header>Reorganization of the Eastern Army.</header>\n<body>that the German reinforcements should not be brought forward via Krakow, but should be unloaded at the Silesian-Polish border, and that from there an independent operation should be conducted, for which even the participation of Austro-Hungarian forces north of the Vistula was hoped for. This did not at all correspond to the plans of the Austro-Hungarian military leadership. Archduke Friedrich urged the German Emperor again on September 15 and requested unloading at Krakow-Tarnow and the subordination of the German army under Austro-Hungarian command. The intervention of this army was required as soon as possible north of Tarnow, \"if joint action is to be ensured.\" The operational idea underlying this demand of the allied commander was not quite clear to the German military leadership. General v. Freytag also urgently pointed out in two communications that, based on previous experiences, a separate use of all German troop bodies, as a special left wing group, was absolutely better than a mixing with Austro-Hungarian units, as might correspond to the wishes of the allies.\nOn September 17, the German Supreme Army Command finally ordered the two army corps prepared in East Prussia to be transferred to the 9th Army; it determined \u2014 in accordance with the urgent demands of the allies \u2014 that the last arriving corps should now be unloaded at Krakow. The operation proposed by the command of the 2nd Army, to be conducted separately from the Austro-Hungarian army, was thus made impossible. At the same time, however, the German Emperor appointed Generaloberst v. Hindenburg as the commander of the 9th Army in place of General v. Schubert and thus also resolved the question of Austro-Hungarian command, as the Generaloberst ranked higher in service than the supreme commander of the allied army. \"I entrust you,\" the order continued, \"with the overall command of all operations in the East. The 9th Army, which General v. Schubert takes over, remains under your command. I reserve directives for cooperation with the Austrian army and operations in Prussia.\"\nGeneral Ludendorff, still unaware of these latest decisions, had already left Insterburg for Breslau early on September 16 to prepare the assembly of the new army. On September 18, the Generaloberst himself followed him there with the majority of the staff of the previous command.

Below stood to support the allied I Corps on the right bank of the Radomka. On October 24, it had advanced several kilometers further east in the forest, but no decision had been made here. Meanwhile, at least one infantry and one cavalry division seemed to be advancing from Rychtynpol, Tarnow, and Warta against the left flank and rear of the corps. General v. Gallwitz led 1 1/2 divisions to attack them on October 25. He encountered both divisions of the Russian Grenadier Corps, against which his corps had already fought at Novo-Alexandria. Further north, a mixed brigade of the 41st Infantry Division of the German XX Army Corps under Major General v. B\u00f6hmann and the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Cavalry Division mainly fought against Russian cavalry. The 6th Guard Infantry Brigade under Major General v. Friedeburg and the 1st Guard Reserve Division under Major General Albrecht managed to push back the Russian grenadiers, partly in heavy fighting, several kilometers and take 1600 prisoners from them. However, their own losses were considerable; they amounted to more than 600 men in the 1st Guard Reserve Division alone. A full decision had not yet been reached despite the initial success. General v. Gallwitz wanted to continue the attack on October 26 to throw the enemy against the Radomka from the west. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg agreed, despite serious doubts about whether the Austro-Hungarian army could continue to hold before Iwangorod, and despite the threatening growth of the Russian wing west of Warsaw, which would soon force the relocation of the Guard Reserve Corps to the west.\nOctober 26 brought the turning point: Before the Guard Reserve Corps, the enemy had retreated north of the Radomka during the night to a position further back. On the other hand, General Dankl had to decide to yield to the constantly growing Russian pressure. He wanted to begin the retreat the following day. But the events were stronger: The Russians had meanwhile also gained a foothold south of the Ilshanka near Solez on the left bank of the Vistula.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) Koroltkow, Warsaw-Iwangorod, p. 216, states the total loss of the corps at 5000 men and notes that the German attack was so fierce that the Grenadier Corps \"began to retreat and could only be held with difficulty.\"\n</footer>\n", "179": "\n<pageno>554</pageno>\n<header>A Crisis of the Two-Front War.</header>\n<body>\nBy mid-September, Russia, as had become known in Berlin, had directed an alliance offer to Bucharest, which dangerously strengthened the already existing inclination here to side with the enemies of the Central Powers. Only the threat from Turkey and Bulgaria of armed action against Romania, should it enter the war against Austria-Hungary, had prompted the leading statesmen in Bucharest to exercise restraint. With King Carol I, a loyal friend of the Central Powers had passed away on October 10; that his successor, King Ferdinand, declared for the continuation of his predecessor's policy was initially reassuring.\nWhile negotiations with Bulgaria over its entry into the war on the side of the Central Powers had come to a complete standstill since early October, efforts in Constantinople seemed more successful. Since the day of the neutrality declaration on August 3, a stubborn struggle had been taking place here for many weeks between the \"Neutrality Party\" under Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha and the \"War Party\" under War Minister Enver Pasha. The presence of the German military mission under Marshal Liman von Sanders, as well as the arrival of the German Mediterranean Division in the Dardanelles on August 10, namely the large cruiser \"Goeben\" and the small cruiser \"Breslau\" under Vice Admiral Souchon, had a significant influence on the development of events in Turkey. After selling the German ships to the Turkish government, Souchon had the Ottoman insignia affixed to both cruisers and was appointed commander of the floating Turkish naval forces. From early October, the War Party began to assert itself more and more in Constantinople. A visible success of the German or Austro-Hungarian arms could now give the impetus for Turkey to strike, which Bulgaria might then join. This prospect had strengthened General von Falkenhayn in the decision to finally force the long-delayed decision in the West through a new massive effort, in order to then carry out the large transport movement to the eastern theater of war.\nHowever, the hope of bringing about a rapid turnaround in the situation through the deployment of the newly formed 4th Army in the West was not fulfilled. Yet, despite the great exhaustion of the opponents, General von Falkenhayn did not lose faith that he would achieve a major, decisive success with the new operation planned in Flanders.\n</body>\n", "035": "\n<pageno>410</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>\nv. Hindenburg and his Chief of Staff felt satisfaction that they were called back to joint activity by the new orders of the Kaiser. Both men were so closely connected by their previous successful cooperation, begun under the most difficult conditions, that they found the initially ordered separation hard to bear.\nThe German Eastern Army was organized for further operations into:\nThe 9th Army*) under Colonel General v.

This division, leaning on the German Guard Reserve Corps with its other wing, retreated, and the remaining parts of the I Corps joined it. Thus, the order issued by General Dankl on October 26 at 1 p.m. to initiate the retreat actually only represented the approval of the movements already underway. They were to be conducted by the evening of that day to the general line Gwole\u0144\u2014Jedlnia, and on the 27th to Kaszjano\u2014Radom.\nSimultaneously with the issuance to their own troops, the retreat order was also supposed to be communicated to the German Guard Reserve Corps, which was still known to be in attack\u00b9). In the attempt to transmit this message via the German XX Army Corps, to which the most reliable telephone connection was available, its chief of staff intervened. Colonel Hell had just received a report of favorable progress in the battle with General v. B\u00f6hmann and did not see the overall situation as immediately threatening. He therefore suggested not to disturb the Guard Reserve Corps in its promising attack and to inform them of the order later. This was followed by the allied side\u00b2). Meanwhile, however, the German High Command received the following report around 4 p.m. from the leader of the German telephone station in Radom to Lieutenant Hoffmann: \"I have just overheard an Austrian army order that has passed through here and which I assume will interest you. The 1st Austrian Army is to begin the retreat immediately; however, this is not to be told to the German Guard Reserve Corps before 6 p.m.\u00b3).\" This message gave the German High Command, which did not recognize the connections, the erroneous impression that the communication of the retreat order was being delayed by the Austro-Hungarian side for selfish reasons. Even immediate orders from General Dankl to cover the flank of the German Corps endangered by the retreat and subsequent clarification could not dispel the first impression.

The main reserves of Posen, Thorn, and Graudenz were to \"take over border security against their fortresses, ready for later offensive action.\" When Generaloberst v. Hindenburg left East Prussia, he had nothing to add to the orders he had previously given there as commander of the 8th Army. The next task of this army was to advance against the important Russian deployment route Grodno\u2014Warsaw.\nIn the meantime, General Ludendorff had made the necessary arrangements with the Austro-Hungarian Army Command regarding the operations of the 9th Army.\nb) The Agreements with the Allies. \u2014 Position towards the Supreme Army Command.\nSee Map 14 and Sketch 6.\nWild rumors about the fate of the German Landwehr Corps, which was retreating through Galicia as part of the Austro-Hungarian Army, had reached Silesia but were not confirmed. The commanding general, General of Infantry v. Woyrsch, reported that despite heavy losses, there was no respect for the Russians, who were \"moderate in attack, tolerable in defense.\"\nOn September 18, Generalmajor Ludendorff traveled from Breslau to Neu-Sandez to the Austro-Hungarian headquarters; he was in high spirits. On the Austro-Hungarian front, the Russians were no longer pressing, and the latest reports made the condition of the individual armies appear favorable, much better than the harsh reality. The mood at the allied army command had accordingly brightened. Thus, General\n</body>\n", "109": "\n<pageno>484</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>Unfavorable experiences with the proximity of Austro-Hungarian troops from Tarnawka were still fresh in memory.\nFor the Guard Reserve Corps, the delay in communicating the retreat order had no consequences; the Russians did not press anywhere. General v. Gallwitz had halted the advance against the front of the new Russian positions north of the Radomka in consideration of the overall situation already in the morning. Only the parts of the XX Army Corps, along with the allied 3rd Cavalry Division, supported by parts of the 1st Guard Reserve Division, were fully engaged in combat. A decision had not yet been made here. Without being disturbed in any way, the German troops withdrew from the enemy on the evening of October 26.\nOn the night of October 26 to 27, the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army stood from the Iljanka estuary over Swolen to Jedlina, with the German Guard Reserve Corps deployed forward on the left at Glowaczow and northwest of this place. The enemy held back. On the morning of October 27, the withdrawal was to be continued.\nThe operation, begun with doubts on the German side and confidence on the Austro-Hungarian side, had to be broken off after five days of partially heavy fighting with a booty of almost 15,000 prisoners \u2014 at least 3,000 of them by the German Guard Reserve Corps. The Austro-Hungarian 1st Army had lost 40,000 to 50,000 men, the Guard Reserve Corps 1,000 men.\nThe expectation of the Austro-Hungarian military leadership that the enemy masses would \"surge\" over the river as soon as the crossing points were cleared had been fulfilled. This early pursuit resulted from the fact that the Russians had already ordered the attack for October 20. However, their strength grew so rapidly since they could cross the Vistula unhindered that the soon-to-be-gained superiority took impotence but the situation festively. Further delay in Warsaw soon made it impossible to remain in Hungary, a beautiful victory at this point or on the Austro-Hungarian right wing in Galicia would have turned the overall situation. Instead, the allied army was now also in defense in Galicia.</body>\n<footer>1) Zam II, G. 334. \u2014 2) Conrad V, G. 399.

Conrad Suggests Shifting the Focus of Warfare to the East.</header>\n<body>By the end of October, the situation in the East had significantly worsened due to the necessary withdrawal of German and Austro-Hungarian forces from southern Poland. The full seriousness of the situation was revealed in the report from Generaloberst v. Hindenburg to the Supreme Army Command on October 26th in the afternoon regarding the impending withdrawal of the 9th Army1). The valuable provinces of Silesia and Posen, as well as parts of East Prussia, were threatened by Russian invasion. The Upper Silesian industrial area was as indispensable for the war effort as the vast agricultural lands of these eastern provinces, on whose yield the nutrition of the entire population largely depended. Whether the resistance of the Danube Monarchy would be sufficient to withstand the Russian incursion into Bohemia and Moravia, into the territory of the already unreliable Czechs, was uncertain. The seriousness of this situation also influenced the political stance of the Balkan states. The prospects for Bulgaria's participation in the war began to fade, and the threat of Romania joining the Allies became less imminent, especially as Queen Maria increasingly used her influence passionately for this cause. Despite the unfavorable general situation, General v. Falkenhayn believed he had to stick to his original goal, to achieve a decisive success in the West before regrouping stronger forces to the eastern theater of war.\nOn October 27th, a telegram from General v. Conrad arrived: \"Only the grave consequences of the current moment compel me to share my view of the situation with Your Excellency. I believe that a decisive success in the West will still require long battles, but here in the East, where the enemy is energetically deploying his superiority of 30 divisions, a rapid breakthrough and thus decisive for the fate of Germany and Austria-Hungary.\" General v. Conrad's suggestion was not convenient for General v. Falkenhayn at this moment. In the hope of winning over the Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff through a verbal discussion for his view, he proposed a meeting on the same day together with a representative of the Army High Command.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 488.</footer>\n", "181": "\n<pageno>556</pageno>\n<header>A Crisis of the Two-Front War.</header>\n<body>mandates 8 and 9 for October 30 in Berlin. Given the tense situation on the Austro-Hungarian front, General v. Conrad believed himself to be personally indispensable and offered, if the discussion could not take place at his headquarters in Neu-Sandez, to send his wing adjutant, Major Rundmann, to Berlin with written instructions, the essential content of which he had already telegraphed to General v. Falkenhayn in Mezi\u00e8res on October 28. He first thoroughly explained his view that \"now the decision must undoubtedly be sought in Poland west of the Vistula.\" Then it continued: \"... I consider that in the next six weeks the main decision lay in the West, i.e., on the French theater of war, but now it is located on the eastern theater of war, i.e., in Russian Poland, because the threat from there is much more dangerous for Germany than that from the West. But if a decisive settlement is made with Russia, then the decision in the West can be pursued with increasing calm. \u2014 However, if this decision in the East is to be of decisive value, it must first be immediate and second with strong forces; therefore, at least 30 German divisions must be deployed to the left of the 9th Army. If this happens, then the k. and k. armies would indeed try to hold back the Russian Bornirsch as much as possible, but if forced to retreat, they must accomplish this to the Danube line Vienna\u2014Budapest.\"\nGeneral v. Falkenhayn responded to this wire with a renewed request for General v. Conrad's personal appearance in Berlin: \"Despite the conviction of the urgent necessity of direct verbal discussion, the trip to Neu-Sandez is unfortunately too time-consuming for me. I am in Berlin War Ministry from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on October 30. If Your Excellency can still make the trip possible, which would be highly desirable for coordination in operations, please send your wing adjutant. I must, of course, point out the very conditional value of the discussion through adjutants.\" General v. Conrad, however, insisted on his decision to be represented by his wing adjutant.\nBefore the joint meeting on October 30, according to a communication from General Ludendorff, a confidential discussion took place between him and General v. Falkenhayn at the War Ministry in Berlin, in which the latter described the situation on the western theater of war in Flanders as \"very promising.\" The impending deployment of the army group was, as he firmly hoped, to bring about the \"imminent decision\" on</body>\n", "251": "\n<pageno>626</pageno>\n<header>Index of Persons.</header>\n<body>\nv.

The Retreat from Poland.\na) The Battles on the Western Flank of the 9th Army and the Initiation of the Retreat.\nSee Maps 15 and 17.\nAs long as the allied Austro-Hungarian 1st Army held its ground at Ivangorod, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg had not yet given up hope that the attack against the Russians north of the Pilitza might still be carried out. Since the withdrawal of Mackensen's group from Warsaw on the night of October 20, the bulk of his army had been positioned in the nearly 90 km wide front Bielobrzegi-Rawa-area 15 km south of Lowitsch, to initially intercept the expected Russian assault. On the right flank, the reunited XX Army Corps stood in an extended front behind the broad and often marshy lowlands of the Pilitza, between Nowe-Miasto and Rawa, the Landwehr Corps joined, followed by Mackensen's group, in the middle of which \u2014 flanked by the two divisions of the XVII Army Corps \u2014 was the Frommel Corps. Further left, the nearly 50 km wide area up to the Vistula was covered only by two cavalry divisions and Landsturm. The XI Army Corps was still near Radom and westward.\nAlready on October 20, the Russians had begun to follow General v. Mackensen's troops in a broad front. How the German High Command assessed the situation in the following days is shown by an entry in the war diary from October 23: \"According to the reports of the corps and the numerous intercepted Russian radio messages, it can be assumed with some certainty that the Russians are army-like weak south of Warsaw, but very strong at the Rawa and Pilitza. Either they fear an encirclement of their right flank from Thorn \u2014 or, more likely given their strength, they intend an offensive encircling the German left flank while simultaneously holding the allied forces in front of Ivangorod. \u2014 Despite today's success in front of Ivangorod, the situation of the German army\n</body>\n<footer>1) See p. 472 and the overview on p. 550. \u2014 2) p. 471.</footer>\n", "037": "\n<pageno>412</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>\nLudendorff in Neu-Sandez, as he reported to the Supreme Army Command, maintained a \"thoroughly confident outlook\" despite heavy losses. However, the impression he gained of the allied army's combat readiness was not favorable, and yet it did not even show the full extent of this army's weakness.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Army (2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 1st Army, the latter including the German Landwehr Corps) had reached the western San River bank with 48\u00b9) infantry divisions (including 8\u00bd Landsturm divisions\u00b2) and 11 cavalry divisions. Its front was thus compressed to a width of about 150 km from south of Przemysl to the Vistula above Sandomir. Further east, small Landsturm forces (equivalent to German Landwehr) held the Carpathian passes. North of the Vistula, there were only weak border and railway protection units, but no combat-ready formations, not even cavalry. The enemy initially did not press forward. However, General v. Conrad expected that the Russians would soon resume their offensive toward Krakow. Meanwhile, due to his armies' reduced combat strength, he wanted to disengage from the enemy to resume fighting only where \"direct battle support\" through Imperial German reinforcements was secured. This meant leaving the large fortress of Przemysl in front of the lines. The 2nd Army was to withdraw southward into the Carpathians, while the three armies of the left wing had to retreat behind the Biala and the Dunajec to the naturally strong position Gryb\u00f3w\u2014Tarnow, which was only about 50 km wide. This very tight concentration of three entire armies for a retreat movement astonished the German general. General v. Conrad justified it with the extraordinarily large gaps in the troops: the \"combat strength\" of the army in Galicia totaled only 400,000 men\u00b3).\nRegarding the Russians, it was known that they were following slowly. They cautiously approached the outer works of the Przemysl fortress and the San bridgeheads of Jaroslaw and Sieniawa, but further downstream, where no resistance was attempted, they had already crossed the river on September 15 after the withdrawal of the Austrians and Hungarians. General v. Conrad assumed that to the right (southeast) of the Vistula, a total of five Russian armies had reached the general line Kalusz\u2014San mouth, beginning from the southeastern wing with the 7th, 8th, 3rd, 5th, and 4th Armies, while the 9th Army was positioned in the second line behind them in the area southeast\n</body>\n<footer>\n\u00b9) Every 2 individual brigades are counted as 1 division.\n\u00b2) The Austro-Hungarian Landsturm corresponded to German Landwehr.\n\u00b3) Conrad IV, p. 805.\n</footer>\n", "254": "\n<pageno>629</pageno>\n<header>Index of Persons.</header>\n<body>\nSchabel, Major General 226.\nSchar, Major General, Commander of the 72nd Infantry Brigade 442. 449. 452.\nBaron von Scheffer-Boyadel, General of Infantry, Commanding General of the XXV Reserve Corps 464. 531. 533. 534. 541.\nScheremann, Russian General of Cavalry, Commander-in-Chief of the 2nd Army 460. 461. 492. 495. 522.\nvon Schenck, General of Infantry, Commanding General of the XVIII Army Corps 43. 90. 193.\nvon Schlichtius and Neidorff, Commander of the 6th Reserve Division 222. 301.\nCount Schlieffen, Field Marshal, Chief of the General Staff of the Army 8. 565. 567. 581.\nCount von Schmettow, Lieutenant General, Commander of the 6th Cavalry Division 307.\nSchmidt von Knobelsdorf, Lieutenant General, Chief of the General Staff of the 5th Army 25. 65. 66. 74. 93. 105. 118. 328.\nvon Scholtz, General of Artillery, Commanding General of the XX Army Corps 450. 456.\nvon Schr\u00f6der, Admiral, Leader of the Marine Division 222.\nvon Schubert, General of Artillery, Commander-in-Chief of the 8th Army, later Commanding General of the XXVII Reserve Corps 323. 408. 409. 410. 501. 504. 505. 506. 507. 508. 509. 510. 512. 513. 514. 515. 516. 517. 518. 519. 520. 521. 525. 526. 527. 528. 536. 547. 548.\nvon der Schulenburg, Colonel, Commander of the 11th Landwehr Brigade 209. 325.\nSieger, Lieutenant General, Chief of the Field Ammunition Service 102. 147.\nSiewers, Russian General of Infantry, Commander-in-Chief of the 10th Army 544. 545. 546. 547.\nSlameczka, Austro-Hungarian Colonel in the General Staff 436.\nSmith Dorrien, British General, Leader of the II Corps 363.\nSontag, Major General, Commander of the 41st Infantry Division 444.\nSuchon, Vice Admiral, Leader of the Mediterranean Division 554. 562.\nvon Stein, Lieutenant General, Commanding General at the XIV Reserve Corps, former Quartermaster General 20. 22. 28. 143. 165. 169.\nSteinmetz, Lieutenant General, General of Foot Artillery at the A.

Falkenhayn and Major General Ludendorff, Colonel Tappen and Major Rundmann also participated\"), the situation in Poland was first discussed. Here, Major Rundmann expressed, based on his written instructions, that according to General v. Conrad's view, a quick success in the West was no longer to be expected; therefore, it was now a matter of seeking the decision in the East. The Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff considered German reinforcements of about 30 divisions necessary. General v. Falkenhayn described the transfer of such strong forces from the West to the East as impossible, as then \"any success in the West would be excluded. Transport, deployment, etc., would take so long that in the end the front in the West would collapse before one could still fight in the East. That would be no relief. The German decision must proceed in the West; in the East, it must be held out as long as possible.\" To Major Rundmann's question of how long this could last, General v. Falkenhayn replied that he could not answer that now, perhaps six weeks. The leadership of the operations planned on the eastern theater of war was then discussed in more detail, with Major General Ludendorff stating that the plans were not yet fully developed. The question of whether \"the Russian advance had indeed stalled\" and the German 9th Army \"had regained its freedom of movement\" was not yet fully clarified. The certainty of this, however, would be the prerequisite for a new German offensive. In the further course of the conversation, General v. Falkenhayn insisted on his view that \"the decision must continue to be sought in the West.\" Major General Ludendorff believed, as he reported\"), the decision of</body>\n<footer>1) How firmly General v. Falkenhayn believed in a great success in the newly initiated offensive in Flanders is also evident from a statement he made on the same day to the Chief of the Ottoman General Staff, General Bronsart v. Schellendorff, who had arrived from Constantinople to give a lecture in Berlin, regarding his views on the difficulties of ammunition supply in Turkey: \"In 14 days, Turkey will have as much ammunition as it wants.\" He expected Romania to join the Central Powers in the spring with all certainty. This remark indicated an imminent great success in the West, as otherwise, at this time, one could hardly expect Romania to switch sides.\n2) The representative of Army High Command 8 could not arrive in time.\n3) Letter from General Ludendorff to the Reichsarchiv dated February 6, 1927.</footer>\n", "255": "\n<pageno>630</pageno>\n<header>Index of Persons.</header>\n<body>\nWahnschaffe, Major General, Commander of the 41st Landwehr Brigade 209. 231.\nvon Wandel, Lieutenant General, Deputy Minister of War 5. 273.\nWaldorf, Lieutenant General, Commander of the 52nd Reserve Division 321. 322.\nBaron von Wangenheim, German Ambassador in Constantinople 14. 563.\nBaron von Watter, Lieutenant General, Commanding General of the XIV Army Corps 97. 100.\nWeddigen, Captain 11.\nvon Wegerer, Lieutenant General, Commander of the 4th Landwehr Division 441.\nWeide, Colonel 32. 36. 37. 40.\nKnight von Wenninger, Lieutenant General, Bavarian Military Plenipotentiary at the Great Headquarters 76. 84. 284. 286.\nvon Werder, Lieutenant General, Commander of the 5th Army Replacement Division 228. 239. 242.\nWielemans, Belgian General, Chief of the General Staff 384. 387.\nWilhelm II, German Emperor, King of Prussia 1. 10. 79. 105. 148. 184. 185. 187. 218. 274. 276. 288. 340. 341. 394. 395. 406. 407. 409. 410. 467. 468. 527. 528.558. 559. 560.\nWilhelm, Crown Prince of the German Empire and of Prussia, Lieutenant General, Commander-in-Chief of the 5th Army 17. 49. 94. 348. 355. 356.\nWilson, British General 393.\nvon Windler, Lieutenant General, Commander of the 2nd Guards Infantry Division 202.\nvon Woyrsch, General of Infantry, Commanding General of the Landwehr Corps 411.\nvon Wrisberg, Chief of the Army Department in the Ministry of War 273.\nvon Wrochem, Lieutenant General, Commander of the 21st Landwehr Brigade 451. 457.\nKnight von Xylander, General of Infantry, Commanding General of the I Bavarian Army Corps 87. 89.\nZieten, Major General 226.\nZimmermann, Undersecretary in the Foreign Office 12. 559.\nvon Zweyl, General of Infantry, Commanding General of the VII Reserve Corps 71.\n</body>\n", "038": "\n<pageno>413</pageno>\n<header>Discussion in Neu-Sandez, 18 September.</header>\n<body>from Iwangorod gathered. All in all, he counted on 57 to 58 Russian\ninfantry divisions, six of which were tied up by Przemysl, so that in\ntotal 51 to 52 divisions would continue the advance). The\nRussians could thereby invade Hungary via the Carpathian passes\nor turn towards Krakow and Silesia. The former seemed\nto General Ludendorff not unlikely for the further shaping of the military\noverall situation in the East, but it was the less likely. On the left bank of the Vistula, General v. Conrad\nassumed about one Russian corps northwest of the San estuary as well as three to\nfour cavalry divisions border detachments in western Poland;\nlarge rail transports from Warsaw to the south, in the direction\nof Kielzy, were to take place. An immediate threat to the Austro-\nHungarian northern flank no longer existed in view of the approach of the German\n9th Army.\nIf the enemy continued to follow the allied army, it had to come to a\nbattle at the Dunajec. Then the German 9th Army could bring about the decision on\nthe northern flank through encirclement. If the enemy halted his advance beforehand or turned towards\nHungary, then General v. Conrad wanted to proceed with the Hindenburg army\nto attack. In any case, a strong\nnorthern flank was necessary to deliver a decisive blow.\nGeneral Ludendorff therefore suggested the extension of the Austro-Hungarian\narmy from Tarnow northwards to the Vistula and the reinforcement of this northern flank\nby parts of the 2nd Army from the Carpathians.\nHe also urgently needed to send Austro-Hungarian cavalry to the left\nbank of the Vistula to conceal the German deployment there.\nThe discussion finally resulted in agreement on the overall\nassessment of the situation as well as the next intentions; the following\nagreement was reached: 1. If the Russians press, the Austro-\nHungarian armies with the northern flank along the Vistula will retreat towards\nKrakow. Austro-Hungarian cavalry will be advanced from the south to\nKielzy. \u2014 2. The German 9th Army gathers north of\nKrakow. \u2014 3. Both armies immediately take the offensive after the\nassembly of the 9th Army.\nWhile General Ludendorff was negotiating in Neu-Sandez,\nColonel General v. Hindenburg had arrived in Breslau. After clarity about\nthe cooperation with the Austro-Hungarian army was achieved,</body>\n", "111": "\n<pageno>486</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>due to the conditions on the left flank and the increasing numerical superiority, the situation did not improve. Furthermore, the Army High Command believed it could hardly count on Austrian cooperation for the upcoming decision. \"Whether the planned thrust over the lower Pilitza towards Warsaw\" was still possible had therefore become increasingly questionable. The XI Army Corps, intended for cooperation, had to be set in motion towards the threatened extreme left flank, and General v. Mackensen had received orders to prepare the further withdrawal of this flank.\nOn October 24, when the enemy had not reached the positions of the Mackensen group, it withdrew, with its outer flank to Kolaszyn, south of Lontschitz. Further north, the cavalry corps and landsturm, repelling the Russians, retreated westward. Only near the city of Rawa, where the enemy's pressure had already been most felt the day before, did an incident occur: parts of the 21st Landwehr Brigade were inserted into the front of the 35th Infantry Division. Due to discrepancies in command transmission, the Landwehr infantry withdrew, while batteries of the active division remained; eleven guns fell into the hands of the sharply pressing Russian I Corps.\nThe enemy appeared in places as early as October 25 before the new positions of General v. Mackensen. Against them and the Landwehr Corps adjoining on the right, he undertook fierce but unsystematic attacks. In the process, parts of the Russian 22nd Infantry Division from I Corps, near Gluchow, west of Rawa, managed to penetrate deep into the position in the morning fog on the border between the German 35th Infantry Division and the 21st Landwehr Brigade; a counterattack led by the commander of the 87th Infantry Brigade, Major General v. Hahn, with limited reserves, cut off the intruding Russians; their remnants were captured. At the same time, however, Russian forces from the counter-move north of Lodz also threatened the western flank of the Mackensen group. Here, in the meantime, the German XI Army Corps under General v. Pl\u00fcskow was advancing. Its forward, 38th Infantry Division under Lieutenant General Wagner attacked at Strykow and defeated the enemy; the 22nd Infantry Division was even further back.</body>\n<footer>At the Army High Command, reports about the growth of the Russian right wing had meanwhile become more and more consolidated.

Falkenhayn \"could not contradict\" because he had just recently, in a private conversation, presented \"the success in the West at Ypres as within reach and assured.\" \"Since the Supreme Army Command sought the decision in the West,\" it is stated in General Ludendorff's communication, \"I declined to do everything to hold the Eastern Front.\" He pointed out to General v. Falkenhayn that according to the war situation \"fights must develop along the entire eastern border of the Kingdom of Prussia, which are closely interconnected; a unified and strict leadership is therefore a necessity\"1).\nAs a result of this discussion, the Kaiser appointed Generaloberst v. Hindenburg on November 1, relieving him from his position as leader of the 9th Army, to \"Commander-in-Chief of all forces in the East of the Reich.\" Major General Ludendorff remained his Chief of Staff. The 8th and 9th Armies and the Deputy General Commands of the I., II., V., VI., XVII., and XX. Army Corps, along with their fortresses, were subordinated to him.\nWhen General v. Conrad learned of Falkenhayn's decision regarding the further conduct of the two-front war, he believed he could not be reassured. On October 31, he telegraphed again to the German Supreme Army Command: \"Telegram received from Berlin that deployment of strong forces in the East was rejected. Can only emphasize again, referring to the local telegram of October 28, that in the event of such deployment, success would be achievable and thus the overall situation would be considered favorable both militarily and politically...\"\nA final attempt by Emperor Franz Josef to win the German Emperor for the Eastern decision also failed. Following a suggestion from General v. Conrad, Emperor Franz Josef sent a telegram to Emperor Wilhelm, which concluded with the words: \"In the highest interest of our common cause, I must urgently ask you, dear friend, for those appropriate measures that make us strong enough together to defeat the Russians and thoroughly prevent any further advance by them.\" In the German Emperor's response on November 1, it was stated: \"... As much as I must agree with you that only the deployment of very ample forces to the East can make our allied armies strong enough to decisively defeat the Russians, I am nevertheless not</body>\n", "184": "\n<pageno>559</pageno>\n<header>Attempt by Emperor Franz Josef to win the Emperor over to the offensive decision.</header>\n<body>\nto my deep regret, to allow that postponement, apart from stronger cavalry, to take place now. Unless I succeed in defeating our enemies on the western front so that their offensive power is crippled, withdrawing strong German forces from the western front would not only result in a certain failure in the west but also likely no success in the east, as the arrival of these German reinforcements in the east can only occur very late for purely technical reasons, and the Russians would initially evade the counterattack. We would not come any closer to our ultimate goal. Only by delaying action on the eastern front until the necessary decision in the west, even if only partially, is achieved, can our common goal be reached...\u201c In conclusion, Emperor Wilhelm suggested placing all Austrian-Hungarian forces gathered and yet to be deployed on the left bank of the Vistula under the command of Generaloberst von Hindenburg in operational matters. However, Emperor Franz Josef refused such subordination.\nGeneral von Falkenhayn was by no means unclear about having put everything on one card with his decision to continue the offensive in the west. He watched the outcome of the battles in Flanders, which had resumed with the deployment of Army Group Fabeck on October 30, with understandable tension. But even the first days of fighting made it clear, despite some local progress, that a greater success could no longer be achieved here, since the Belgians had managed to flood large areas along the Yser Canal up to Dixmude by opening the sluices at Nieuport, making any further successful operations by the 4th Army fighting here impossible. In Emperor Wilhelm's response to Emperor Franz Josef on November 1, doubt about the decisive success of the campaign in Flanders had already been expressed; now they were apparently only counting on a \"partial\" success. But even this last weak hope was finally destroyed by the unfavorable news about the course of the battles of Group Fabeck. It became increasingly clear that the long-desired breakthrough of the enemy front was no longer to be hoped for. This was a severe and bitter disappointment for General von Falkenhayn, which shook his confidence in his military fortune.\n</body>\n", "039": "\n<pageno>414</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>The task was to coordinate the overall war strategy of the two German Eastern armies. The 9th Army had just begun unloading the Guard Reserve Corps west of Kattowitz, the XX Army Corps was moving towards Tschenstochau, and the remaining parts of the army were to follow. On September 19, the main reserve Posen received orders to advance from Kalisch to Sieradz, while the Polish border guards were to be pushed forward towards the Warthe. The next day, the 35th Reserve Division (main reserve Thorn) of the 8th Army, which was still south of Mlawa, was designated for transport to Thorn to advance from there behind the Vistula-Narew via Wlozlawek towards Warsaw. However, it seemed necessary to continue exerting \"as strong a pressure as possible towards Warsaw\" from East Prussia. Therefore, the 8th Army was to prepare to \"lead strong parts \u2014 perhaps one to two divisions \u2014 into the area of Mlawa to become offensive from there.\" Whether it would be possible to protect East Prussia from new Russian incursions in the long term with such a weakening of the 8th Army for the benefit of the operation in Poland was uncertain. Therefore, defensive installations were to be prepared here more sustainably.\nSimultaneously with this local leadership measure, the Supreme Army Command was also concerned with easing the situation on the Eastern Front. At the suggestion of Lieutenant General v. Falkenhayn, a larger naval operation against the Russian Baltic coast was prepared to bind forces at this \u2014 as was known \u2014 particularly sensitive point for the Russians, which would then be absent from the land battlefront\u00b9).\nOn September 21, the German 9th Army's high command was relocated to Beuthen in the deployment area of the advancing troops. It became increasingly clear that the Russians had ceased the immediate pursuit of the Austro-Hungarian army at the San; only hesitantly had parts advanced further. Thus, the only reason that \u2014 quite contrary to the intentions of the German leadership in the East \u2014 had triggered the decision to move the 9th Army with the right wing near Krakow was eliminated. However, even now, there was still the possibility to initiate the operation from a more northern direction. Thus, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg wired on September 21 to the Austro-Hungarian high command: \"It is of decisive importance for the continuation of operations that strong Austrian army</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) p. 11, 505 and 520f.</footer>\n", "112": "\n<pageno>487</pageno>\n<header>9th Army, Operations Southwest of Warsaw</header>\n<body>was established by October 25 between Rawka and the Vistula with at least ten infantry divisions: I., IV., XXIII., II. Corps, 50th Infantry Division, and 79th Reserve Division. Thus, the large numerical superiority of the enemy on this flank was already clearly established; furthermore, additional forces were on the march there: the VI Corps, which had previously stood north of Nowogeorgiewsk, and the II Siberian Corps. Finally, it was stated in one of the particularly numerous intercepted Russian radio messages these days, which was addressed as \"very urgent\" to the II Corps: \"from October 25 to 26, parts of the new Renown Army, the staff at the 6th Siberian Division, V Siberian Corps, will advance to the lower Vistula\"\u00b9). Even if this radio message \u2014 which was considered possible by the army command at the time \u2014 was a \"bluff,\" the situation on the German western flank had become so serious that it was untenable without a quick success of the Austro-Hungarian army. The hope for such a turn was barely existent. On the other hand, a retreat to the west, which would have denied the enemy the next path into the heart of the German homeland, was no longer possible. One could only evade in a westerly direction, moving further away from the direction towards Berlin, which then remained on the left flank, with each step. As the first preparation for such a retreat, the order had already been given to the Deputy General Command of the VI Army Corps in Breslau on October 20 to repair the roads leading south from the Kielzy\u2014Noworadomsk line. When it became doubtful on October 25 whether the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army could continue to hold its ground, instructions followed to the same General Command and to the Stage Inspection in Noworadomsk for the immediate construction of a position by pioneers and civilians along the Noworadomsk\u2014Wieslun line.\nThe German 9th Army had held out to the limit of what was possible. For them, the decision came with the retreat of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army from Jangrodor on October 26. The German army, without the prospect of an imminent turn, could no longer be held responsible for exposing itself to the dangers of encirclement. What was to happen next was initially unclear.

Perhaps the thought weighed on the leader of the German operations that his reputation as a commander might be impaired by the great successes of the leaders in the East; his operational decisions were not influenced by this. He did not conceal from himself that if the struggle for decision in the West ended without result, the successful conduct of the two-front war was indeed called into question. What was to happen if the weak forces in the East could no longer withstand the Russian superiority and the Eastern Army was forced to retreat to the Danube, Silesia, Posen, and West Prussia? This danger was all the more serious as the condition of the allied army had repeatedly been judged very unfavorably by both Generaloberst v. Hindenburg and Generalleutnant v. Freytag. These were pressing concerns that filled the soul of the German leader. The tension between the demands of the two theaters of war had reached its peak. Under their influence and with the absence of successes in the West despite utmost efforts, General v. Falkenhayn's self-confidence was severely shaken in those days\u00b9), although his severe mental strain remained generally hidden from his surroundings; for \"never, even in the most severe crises, did he lose his composure,\" as reported by his later associate, General Freiherr v. Freytag\u00b2).\nOn November 3, General v. Falkenhayn was finally appointed Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army while retaining his position as Minister of War. Besides the concern about the course of operations, he was at this time also burdened by the almost more serious concern about the ammunition situation. How much the lack of ammunition had called into question the success of all operations in the West and partly also in the East had often painfully come to his awareness.\nThe mobilization reserves accumulated in peacetime had been depleted, although all munitions suitable for field use from fortresses, depots, surplus stocks, etc., had been drawn upon for their replenishment. In the battles in Flanders, these last reserves were consumed. Thus, the ammunition supply was now almost exclusively dependent on new production.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Communications from the then Chief of the Central Department in the General Staff, Lieutenant Colonel S.

The desire to launch a new strike during this pause inspired the army leadership, as they still felt victorious and superior to the enemy, provided the numerical ratio was not too unfavorable.\nHow seriously the situation was taken is shown by the following report, which was sent to the Supreme Army Command at 1 p.m. on October 26, just as it had been learned that the allied 1st Army intended to retreat the following day\u201c): \u201cAustrians retreat from Ivangorod on October 27. German offensive over Pilitza therefore excluded. 9th Army will have to retreat. \u2014 8th Army instructed to send all available units to Thorn. All formations still in the country requested to move to Posen. In front of the 9th Army, 14 Russian corps, of which 4 to 5 outflank our left wing. Advance of these against the German border cannot be prevented by the army. \u2014 Nothing to expect from the Austrian army. Own Landwehr partially retreats.\u201d When it became clear on the afternoon of October 26 that the allied 1st Army had already yielded to Russian pressure that day, the situation appeared even more threatening. The Supreme Army Command was further informed at 7:30 p.m.: \u201cOwn army repelled all Russian attacks today. Austrian army at Ivangorod broken through and thrown back by Russians. 9th Army must therefore begin retreat on the right wing. Where the Austrian army can be brought to a halt is still unclear\u201c). Through telephone, it was inquired at the Supreme Army Command whether and when reinforcements for the East could be expected. It was especially important to replenish the garrisons of the eastern fortresses, after they had given up their most capable units, the main reserves, and the heavy artillery for use in the open field\u201c), where they could not be spared in the future.\nAt this time, the German offensive in Flanders) was still in full swing.

Right wing of the German army approximately over Kielzy. \u2014 South of the Vistula, offensive of the other Austrian armies with a staggered right wing.\" However, General v. Conrad did not yet believe he could agree to such a plan. The Austro-Hungarian army had just reached the Wis\u0142oka, and the retreat was to continue two more days' marches to the Bia\u0142a and the lower Dunajec. Only west of the Dunajec estuary did the Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff initially want to push a cavalry division, with infantry as a reserve, onto the northern Vistula bank. Otherwise, the armies were to bring in reinforcements and await the arrival of the German 9th Army. From the upcoming joint operation, General v. Conrad hoped \u2014 as he had already written to Colonel General v. Moltke on September 20 \u2014 for the \"campaign decision in the East.\" He had therefore simultaneously requested the deployment of further German forces, even if only second or third line, for the offensive into Poland.\nIn contrast, Colonel General v. Hindenburg insisted on September 22 that \"the decision must be made now and executed, to bring a strong Austro-Hungarian army onto the northern Vistula bank during the retreat.\" He sent the Quartermaster General of the army, Colonel v. Sauerzweig, to Neu-Sandez and also explained to the Austro-Hungarian Captain v. Fleischmann that the German 9th Army must already advance so far north that a major success over the Russians through encirclement is ensured. \"If Austria does not push strong forces over the Vistula, only weaker parts can be used for the encirclement.</body>\n<footer>1) Count Conrad later wrote about this (Conrad IV, p. 832): \"For Colonel General v. Hindenburg, it was obvious to use the strongest possible forces on the left Vistula bank, especially since this provided the cover for Prussian Silesia. However, I had to reckon with the possibility that the Russians would only advance a group from the left Vistula bank, but would lead the main thrust south of the Vistula, which, if successful, would be of serious significance. Moreover, an independent offensive to the right of the Vistula was a threat to the Russians for us. I therefore had to wait for the gradual clarification before I could decide whether the Austro-Hungarian forces should be moved to the northern bank.\"\n2) Conrad, IV, p. 818.

The importance of providing the eastern fortifications with garrisons will be clear to Army Command 9. From here, the 5th Cavalry Division departs in about three days by rail transport towards Posen. Maintaining close relations with Austria is of utmost political importance. Otherwise, instructions for local measures cannot be given from here, as they are in the best hands.\" The following day, General v. Falkenhayn made \"around 40,000 trained men without officers and with few non-commissioned officers\" available for the east; they were designated by the Army Command for the replenishment of the departing troops and the fortress garrisons.\nOn October 27 at 9 a.m., Generaloberst v. Hindenburg ordered the retreat. He had to begin with the most threatened right wing of the army, while the left had to hold near Lodz. Here, General v. Pl\u00fcskow, the commanding general of the XI Army Corps, pushed his third 22nd Infantry Division westward after the success at Strykow and thus also held the area north of Lodz until October 28. Meanwhile, the right wing of the army gradually joined the retreat of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army and the Guard Reserve Corps. On the night of October 28, the Landwehr Corps and the Mackensen Group also withdrew, followed a day later by the XI Army Corps as the last unit. The enemy did not press.\nThe German retreat, in conjunction with the allied 1st Army, initially led the Guard Reserve Corps, the XX Army Corps, and the Landwehr Corps into the Kielzy\u2014Noworadomsk line, while the Mackensen Group, now comprising the XVII Army Corps, Frommel Corps, XI Army Corps, and Korda Cavalry Corps, was to retreat to the prepared position Noworadomsk\u2014Wielun. On the left flank, border protection was advanced northward by the Deputy General Command of the V and II Army Corps against the upper Warthe; it consisted almost entirely of Landsturm with very weak artillery and was to obscure and retreat to the border in the over 160 km gap between Wielun and the outer section of the Thorn fortress near Wloclawek on the Vistula.

Fleischmann personally went to Neu-Sandez to represent this view and added that on the German side, the possibility had also been discussed of undertaking an independent operation with the 9th Army against Iwangorod\u2014Warsaw, if Austro-Hungarian forces were not sent to the left bank of the Vistula. In response, General v. Conrad agreed on September 23 to send five, provisionally even six, Austro-Hungarian divisions of the 1st Army to the northern bank of the Vistula. However, he refused to deploy the entire 1st Army north of the Vistula, as the main Russian forces were still south of the river, where the terrain and their own lack of artillery necessitated numerous narrow divisional sectors. On the left bank of the Vistula, where General v. Conrad now assumed strong Russian forces, probably the Russian 9th Army, were assembling\u00b9), the Austro-Hungarian divisions were to be ready behind the Dunajec estuary\u2014Pintschow line by September 30 to participate in the advance to encircle the Russian northern flank. \u201cThis,\u201d as stated in the response, \u201cunder the strict condition that the German 9th Army conducts this operation in direct cooperation with Austrian forces, with the aim of the entire operation being to achieve success by encircling the main Russian forces advancing against Austrian armies. In line with the advance north of the Vistula, the Austrian armies will also advance on the southern Vistula bank against these Russian forces.\u201d\nThe advance of the German 9th Army was regulated according to these intentions so that the right wing reached the area of Pintschow by September 30. For this, the corps had to be moved from their unloading points in a northeasterly direction, with the XI Army Corps from Krakow initially even moved in an almost northerly direction. In this way, all other possibilities of the situation were also taken into account, as was still possible with the once fixed railway deployment. At the same time, the need arose for the wide-ranging offensive to immediately protect the open northern flank of the advance through deeper echeloning. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg therefore decided to assign the 35th Reserve Division (main reserve from Thorn), which according to the order of the Supreme Army Command of September 17 was to take over border security in the forefield of its fortress, to the 8th Army</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Austro-Hungarian Army Order of September 23, 1914. \u2014 Conrad IV, p. 840.</footer>\n", "186": "\n<pageno>561</pageno>\n<header>Serious State of Artillery Ammunition Supply.</header>\n<body>\nThe domestic industry was relied upon1). Thanks to the measures initiated by the military administration, such as the expansion of state and private enterprises, the involvement of a larger number of private factories in ammunition production, simplifications in shell design, approval of all permissible facilitations in shell acceptance, retention of furloughed skilled workers in munitions factories, etc., it was possible to increase the production of field artillery ammunition significantly beyond the maximum planned delivery quantities. As a result, although not immediately, a relief in supply for the field artillery was expected in the near future, but the ammunition situation for the foot artillery remained extraordinarily serious. The number of factories suitable for the production of the difficult-to-manufacture foot artillery ammunition was as low as their production capacity at the time. It was only at the beginning of October 1914 that the preliminary work for the design of simplified foot artillery shells was completed. Before the industrial plants could transition to mass production, even of these easier and faster to produce shells, months had to pass. In any case, the demand for foot artillery ammunition, depending on caliber and type of gun, was many times higher at the beginning of November than the deliverable, actually delivered quantities. To at least supply the main gun of the foot artillery, the heavy field howitzer, with a certain amount of ammunition, the production of ammunition for other heavy calibers had to be more or less restricted. In addition, initial raw material difficulties were already reported; among other things, the shortage of saltpeter became noticeable due to the increased demand for gunpowder.\nOverall, the artillery ammunition available at the beginning of November was far from sufficient to cover the ongoing minimum needs of the other combat fronts, in addition to the enormous amounts of ammunition consumed solely by the battles in Flanders. The possibility of accumulating sufficient ammunition reserves for future larger combat operations was not conceivable at the time. Therefore, the serious state of artillery ammunition supply had to gain increasingly decisive importance in the operational considerations of the Supreme Army Command.\nIn this difficult situation, a bright spot appeared on the military-political horizon: Turkey had sided with the Central Powers.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) The difficulties of ammunition supply and production are extensively discussed in \"War Armament and War Economy\", Volume II.\n1 World War.

The assignment of replacement troops and the return of part of their horse-drawn artillery located with the field army increased their defensive strength as much as possible. The Vistula above Thorn was to be blocked by mines.\nThe 8th Army in East Prussia had not yet been informed of the full seriousness of the situation in Poland. For their small forces, there was initially no immediate danger; with the railway, parts also over the spit and by waterway, they could be withdrawn at the last moment if necessary. The longer General v. Francois held out, the more he relieved the front of the 9th Army. No response had been received to the request sent to him by Generaloberst v. Hindenburg by October 26 to send all available forces to Thorn. On October 28, General v. Francois reported to the Supreme Army Command in response to a direct inquiry from there that he was in an advancing attack against a superior entrenched enemy. A decision was expected in about eight days. After a military success, transport of parts to Thorn for the 9th Army. The extent of the contributions to the 9th Army depends on the scope of the success. The rest remains on Russian soil to protect East Prussia. In view of the overall situation, these intentions aroused strong concerns in General v. Falkenhayn. When he informed Generaloberst v. Hindenburg, who had not yet been informed by the 8th Army, of them, he had a telegram sent to General v. Francois on the evening of October 28: \"The situation will soon require the deployment of strong forces of the 8th Army to protect West Prussia. Request a detailed report on the situation with the 8th Army.\" General v. Francois replied on October 29 that it was still unclear when the decision would be made; after military success, the transport of one to two army corps to Thorn was planned. If the attack must be abandoned prematurely due to West Prussia, a gradual retreat and then release of East Prussian territory will likely be necessary. Please keep the 8th Army continuously informed of local intentions and positions.\" In this response, the Army Command 9 saw another evasion and asked the Supreme Army Command to intervene. Then General v. Francois reported on October 30 that he could not continue the attack due to a lack of ammunition. Only then did the question of retreat behind the lakes and the transfer of troops to Thorn come into flow on the East Prussian front.\nMeanwhile, the German 9th Army</body>\n<footer>1) Cf. p. 540.</footer>\n", "258": "\n<pageno>635</pageno>\n<header>Troop Directory.</header>\n<body>\nXIV.

A proposal by General v. Mackensen, which aimed primarily at quickly resuming action with regard to his own troops and also corresponded to the views of General v. Gallwitz, had been rejected by Colonel General v. Hindenburg. Only by distancing themselves far from the enemy could they regain operational freedom. Thus, the army approached the borders of Silesia in the last days of October. Following them, the 1st Army of the Austro-Hungarian forces was slowly retreating, while on the right at the Vistula, the allied front still stood. Their prospects had even slightly improved since October 27; the Carpathian railway was restored up to Chyrow. Supplies to the 2nd Army stationed there flowed abundantly. However, General v. B\u00f6hm-Ermolli was able to resume the attack on October 28. He achieved local successes, but they could no longer change the overall situation decisively.</body>\n<header>b) The Russian Operations and Assessment of the October Campaign.</header>\n<body>For this, see maps 14 to 17.\nAfter the setbacks of October 10 and 11\u00b9), General Ivanov suggested a new personal discussion with the Grand Duke in Cholm\u00b2); it took place on October 12. On this occasion, General Ivanov pointed out how much the reinforcement of the Northwestern Front to Warsaw was delayed. These complaints, the previous development of the situation, and a certain understandable mistrust of General Ivanov's leadership\u00b3) after the failures on the Vistula line, but especially the concern for Warsaw, which was believed to be seriously threatened at this time, prompted the Supreme Commander to take the lead of the major offensive himself. The Grand Duke was of the opinion that the fate of the entire first war period had to be decided on the Vistula, which is why achieving success here required the utmost effort. Under these circumstances, it was no longer acceptable to continue in the role of an observer\u2074). On October 13, the Supreme Army Command ordered that General Ruzski, who now commanded the Narew Group (= former Warsaw Division), the 2nd Army, the Cavalry Corps Nowikov, and also the 5th Army, should lead the main attack from Warsaw against the German left flank,</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) See page 462. \u2014 \u00b2) Korolilow, Overview, p. 52; Danilow, p. 315 ff.\n\u00b3) Ibid., p. 317. \u2014 \u2074) Ibid.</footer>\n", "187": "\n<pageno>562</pageno>\n<header>A Crisis of the Two-Front War.</header>\n<body>positioned. On October 29, the Ottoman fleet encountered a Russian mine-laying ship disguised as a merchant steamer in the Black Sea, near the entrance to the Bosporus. The ship was apparently about to lay mines within Turkish territorial waters. This hostile act prompted Admiral Souchon to seize the Russian mine ship and, in retaliation, to bombard Russian war ports and engage Russian naval forces. On November 2, Russia declared war on the High Porte.\nAccording to agreements between the German and Ottoman military leadership, the main forces of the Turkish army, six army corps, were to assemble at Constantinople to protect the capital against possible landings and to engage Russia on European soil. To tie down strong Russian forces on the Caucasus front, three additional Turkish corps were ready in the Armenian border area. For an advance against Egypt, a corps was assembled in southern Palestine. The overall operations were directed by War Minister Enver Pasha, who staffed many key command and administrative positions with officers from the German military mission.\nWith Turkey's entry into the war, new prospects opened up for conducting war against England and Russia. The possibility of completely defeating the eastern enemy came closer. With the final closure of the Dardanelles, whose effective blockade for international traffic had already been ordered by the Porte on September 27, Russia not only lost the shortest connection to its allies, but also faced the threat of being cut off from all supplies from the Mediterranean Sea. If it succeeded in bringing Romania and Bulgaria to the side of the Central Powers through superior force deployment and successful operations on the eastern theater of war, the fate of Russia and Serbia could be sealed.\nIn this decisive hour, General von Falkenhayn received a telegram from Generaloberst von Hindenburg on November 4, urging the regrouping of the main German forces to the east: \"It is intended to unite three army corps of the 9th Army in the Posen-Thorn area to launch an offensive from there with forces of the 8th Army.\" This operation, planned in the most effective direction, promised great success if conducted with strong force. However, the Eastern Army alone was too weak for this; its reinforcement by troops from the west was therefore necessary.\n</body>\n", "043": "\n<pageno>418</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>had been signed \"Moltke\". Colonel General v. Hindenburg responded thus: \"Colonel General v. Moltke: Supreme Army Command holds me accountable for drawing the main reserve of Thorn to the left wing of the 9th Army and not leaving it at Thorn.\" The reasons for the withdrawal followed. The telegram concluded: \"I intend to maintain my issued order and request Your Excellency to grant me the necessary independence in directing the new campaign, just as in my previous operations.\" \u2014 An approving and clarifying response from General v. Falkenhayn followed, but could not completely eliminate the tension that had now developed between the two high command authorities. This tension also transferred to the relationship between the 9th Army High Command and General v. Freytag, who had particularly strongly advocated for the use of German troops in direct connection with the allied armies.\n<header>c) Beginning of Movements and Battle at Opatow, September 30 to October 5.</header>\nSee Map 14 and Sketch 7.\nSeptember 30.     On September 30, the Austro-Hungarian army stood with the 2nd Army under General v. B\u00f6hm-Ermolli in the Carpathians, with the 3rd under General v. Boroevi\u0107, the 4th under General Archduke Josef Ferdinand, and the 1st under General Dankl adjoining them at the Biala and the Dunajec. The cavalry, which had suffered particularly heavily and needed rest, was positioned with its main force \u2014 seven divisions \u2014 initially behind the center, partly also behind the right wing of the army front. The left wing of the 1st Army (5\u00bd infantry and 2 cavalry divisions) had been pushed to the northern bank of the Vistula and had reached the Nida section south of Pintschow. The fortress of Przemysl, whose garrison included three infantry divisions (including four Landsturm brigades), lay 90 km in front of the army's front. At the Carpathian passes and north of the Vistula, here only when approaching the Nida section, there had been insignificant encounters with the enemy; otherwise, the troops, as far as they had not moved to the northern bank of the Vistula, had about a week's rest and time to organize and replenish their units. This was disrupted by the simultaneous need for comprehensive medical preventive measures against dysentery and cholera; the 2nd Army alone had more than 2000 cholera patients, of whom more than half died. To create combat-ready units again, a Landsturm division and the march brigades and regiments that at</body>\n", "042": "\n<pageno>417</pageno>\n<header>9th Army and Supreme Army Command.</header>\n<body>to continue entirely, to draw them directly to the northern flank of the 9th Army. However, the idea of an advance by parts of the 8th Army from Mlawa to Warsaw had to be temporarily abandoned. This army initially used its limited forces entirely for defense on the East Prussian eastern border. Through them, it was hoped that if they were led on Russian soil and offensively, they would bind equally strong, perhaps even stronger Russian forces than by an advance of weaker parts from Mlawa to Warsaw.\nWhen the German Supreme Army Command learned of the new agreements made with General v. Conrad, it wished to adapt the railway march of the 9th Army, ordered under different conditions and already completed, to the new situation as far as possible. Perhaps at least the XI Army Corps, destined for Krakow, whose transport was to begin on September 23 at Insterburg, could still be redirected and unloaded further north. In this sense, General v. Falkenhayn wired on September 24 to the Army High Command 9; he added: \"It is assumed that appropriate agreements with Austrians have already been made for this situation with the enemy.\" This intention of the Supreme Army Command probably also corresponded to the original wishes of the High Command 9, with which it had not agreed. Now the change of the Supreme Army Command came too late, because the transports had been accelerated at the instigation of Generaloberst v. Hindenburg, so that the unloading of the XI Army Corps at Krakow was already in full swing. Thus, the telegram from the Supreme Army Command only caused discontent at the High Command 9. It replied: \"Unloading in Krakow is against our intention, only on the explicit order of the Great Headquarters. Unloading can no longer be changed now, as it is in progress. The army will be moved north after unloading to gain the base that has always been recognized as correct here.\"\nOn the same September 24, however, a telegram signed \"Supreme Army Command\" also requested clarification about the deployment of the 35th Reserve Division (main reserve Thorn) to the 9th Army. This decision, not yet reported by the High Command 9, had become known to the Supreme Army Command through official channels via the field railway authorities. Their intervention here caused dismay among the victors of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes, who were accustomed to complete independence. That Generaloberst v. Moltke had been sidelined was not known; for the incoming wires were still</body>\n", "189": "\n<pageno>564</pageno>\n<header>A Crisis of the Two-Front War.</header>\n<body>The war of movement arbitrarily arose and was unsuitable for a sustainable defense by weaker forces, to clear, as well as to order extensive straightening of protruding arcs for the conservation of forces, even at the cost of surrendering significant parts of conquered enemy territory. However, he believed he could not take responsibility for such a grave decision, as a wide withdrawal of large parts of the Western Front \"would be tantamount to a defeat.\"\nOn November 4, the German Chief of General Staff issued new directives: In Flanders, a new effort was to be demanded to get the key point of all battles, Ypres, into German hands.\nThus, the decision was made to continue the desperate struggle for a tactical success in the West, while in the East the tangible prospects for the success of a major strategic strike were greatly diminished, if not entirely abandoned.</body>\n", "188": "\n<pageno>563</pageno>\n<header>The German Leadership Faces a Significant Turning Point.</header>\n<body>most urgent command; this was done immediately, so the planned operation could effectively prepare the final campaign decision in the East. The management of the two-front war was at a significant turning point.\nGeneral v. Falkenhayn became uncertain; according to his own words, he was already aware at this point that in Flanders \"against the continuously strengthening enemy, another decisive success... could no longer be achieved.\" With the arrival of the report from the Commander-in-Chief East about the intended new operation, the final impetus for the decision on whether the attack in the West should be abandoned and the focus of the war effort shifted to the eastern theater of war had indeed come for him. Such a decision was urged not only by the slim prospects for greater successes in the West and the serious ammunition situation but also by the development of the situation in the Southeast, particularly the events on the Serbian theater of war, where the Austro-Hungarian troops had launched a new attack against the Serbs at the end of October and forced them to retreat. These successes, if corresponding ones on the Russian theater of war were added, could become decisive for Bulgaria's stance, \"for whose armed intervention,\" according to a report from the German ambassador in Constantinople at that time, \"a German-Austrian success in the East was a prerequisite.\" Thus, the opportunity arose to gain a new, valuable ally, perhaps even beyond that through the union of Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania to form the Balkan bloc against Russia and Serbia that had been sought from the beginning.\nGeneral v. Falkenhayn struggled with the decision; the responsibility weighed heavily on him. Indeed, the cessation of operations in Flanders and the dispatch of the last dispensable soldier to the East before forcing a visible success in the West meant a high degree of self-reflection. The French and their allies were completely exhausted by the months-long, extraordinarily heavy fighting and were hardly capable of a major offensive in the near future; however, this could change in the foreseeable future. General v. Falkenhayn was also not clear that with the continuous fortification of the Western Front, it was necessary to secure all the positions that resulted from the consolidation of the be-</body>\n<footer>1) v.

Due to the small number of trained personnel, it was not possible to bring the infantry units back to full strength through this measure; in the cavalry, they had to settle for a squadron strength of 100 riders. The artillery losses were replaced except for 14 cannons still missing from the 2nd Army, and the ammunition was replenished. Thus, by October 1st, the Austro-Hungarian field army on the Russian front had reached a strength of 477,000 infantry, 27,000 cavalry, and 1,578 guns, but still remained almost a quarter behind the level at the beginning of the war. In total, 42 infantry divisions (including 1 division and 9 separate brigades of Landsturm) and 11 cavalry divisions were ready to advance1).\nGeneral v. Conrad had not requested to reinforce this army by withdrawing from the Serbian front; he would hardly have succeeded in Vienna with this. Although a stalemate had occurred in operations against Serbia, about 16 Austro-Hungarian divisions (including 3 brigades of Landsturm) now faced an enemy of hardly equal strength2).\nThe deployment of German forces in close contact with the Austro-Hungarian northern flank had restored confidence and aggressiveness in the allied command as well as in the troops. The commander-in-chief, Archduke Friedrich, expressed his confident mood in the army order of September 30th with the words: \"Hardened in the fire of battles and filled with confidence, you will achieve the final victory and drive the enemy beyond the borders of our homeland. Your bravery and indomitable perseverance guarantee success3).\" Such hope gave the Austro-Hungarian commander the strength to lead his troops back to the attack despite the previous severe shocks. The decision to do so must be highly credited to him.\nIn the German 9th Army, the prospects of the upcoming campaign were not estimated as highly as in the allied army. Even now, the goal of the campaign in the East could initially only be to gain time.

The date for the general offensive was set for October 18.\nMeanwhile, the previously described local battles near Warsaw and Ivangorod continued.\nSouth of Warsaw(1), the Russian 2nd Army, still in assembly, initially did not realize that General v. Mackensen's troops had switched to defense since the evening of October 11. On October 14, a map with the positions of the German forces between Sochaczew and Ivangorod was captured from a downed Russian aircraft. Nevertheless, the intervention of the 36th Infantry Division on the same day at Blonie and the advance of the 21st Landwehr Brigade and the Landsturm Brigade Hofmann gave General Scheidemann the impression of a major German encirclement attack against his own western flank, as intelligence repeatedly reported the deployment of two new German corps at Thorn. Thus, the Russian attacks on this front section initially served only defense, while further north the VI and I Turkestan Corps, previously belonging to the 10th Army, covered the flank and rear against East Prussia(2). General Scheidemann moved the XXIII Corps, the 50th Infantry, the 13th Siberian Rifle Division, and the Cavalry Corps Nowikow (5th, 8th, 14th Cavalry Division), which arrived in the Warsaw fortress area on October 14, as reinforcements behind his right wing. On October 16, the previous right wing corps, II Siberian, had to be supported by the 1st Rifle Brigade of the XXIII Corps in the face of German counterattacks, and the adjoining IV Corps to the east could only hold its positions with difficulty, although now south and west of Warsaw 12 1/2 Russian infantry and 5 cavalry divisions faced only 5 1/2 German infantry and 1 cavalry division(3). General Scheidemann ordered stubborn defense. Even on October 18, the Russian right wing remained on the offensive and \"could hardly hold on.\" The Cavalry Corps Nowikow and cavalry of the 2nd Army fell on German infantry at the lower Bzura; to support them, the 79th Reserve Division, main reserve of Nowogeorgiewsk, was set in motion, while a brigade of the XXIII Corps remained as a garrison in the fortress.

Retrospective.</header>\n<body>At the beginning of November 1914, the successful outcome of the two-front war was seriously in question. The full extent of the crisis can only be assessed when the connections of the operations on the various theaters of war in their previous development and in their interrelations are clarified.\nThe purpose of the German operational plan for the two-front war was to defeat Germany's opponents one after the other. \"The entire endeavor of Germany,\" as stated in the memorandum of Generaloberst v. Moltke on the military-political situation of Germany at the end of November 1911, \"must be directed towards ending the war with a few major blows at least on one side as soon as possible.\" Such a campaign decision could be achieved most quickly and securely against the western opponent; this was also the \"stronger and more dangerous, against whom one must first turn in such a situation\"). Therefore, the bulk of the German army was to be transferred to the western theater of war; \"in the fight against France, according to the view of Generaloberst v. Moltke, \"lay the decision of the war\"). Only as many forces were to be allocated to the eastern theater of war as were required for the rear protection of the German western army and the task of defending the border area. The force ratio between the two theaters of war was about 1:8. At the beginning of the operations, around 80 German divisions were deployed against 83 French, English, and Belgian in the West, and in East Prussia, 9 German against more than 30 Russian; on the entire Eastern front, 60 divisions of the Central Powers faced 110 Russian and Serbian3). This distribution of forces was most carefully adapted to the special tasks of the two theaters of war. It required a rapid decision in the West and for its implementation also a war-</body>\n<footer>1) Memorandum of the then General of the Cavalry Count v.

From these perspectives, the German Supreme Army Command and Generaloberst v. Hindenburg assessed the upcoming operations against the Russians. Nevertheless, they hoped to succeed in delivering an effective blow to the armies standing directly in front of the Austro-Hungarian front. Only by a stroke of luck could more be achieved with the available own forces and the Austro-Hungarian forces weakened by losses.\nOn September 30, the German 9th Army, with its mass \u2014 in the front line XI Army Corps, Guard Reserve Corps, and XX Army Corps, behind the XI Army Corps in the second line the Landwehr Corps \u2014 had reached the area of Chmielnik\u2014Kielzy and northwest of these places, slightly ahead of the Austro-Hungarian northern wing. To protect the northern flank, the XVII Army Corps had fallen back to west of Konsk, the \"Drum Corps\" had reached Petrikau and westward. This corps \u2014 initially consisting only of the main reserve Posen, known as \"Division Bredow,\" and the 8th Cavalry Division \u2014 had been reinforced by the 21st Landwehr Brigade (main reserve Breslau) by the advancing 35th Reserve Division. These forces were to form the northern wing of the advance. The area between them and the border protection of the Thorn fortress was covered by the Landsturm of the Deputy General Commands of the V and II Army Corps from Sieradz to the Vistula. The forces prepared for the advance of the 9th Army totaled: 12 1/2 infantry divisions (including 4 1/2 Landwehr divisions) and 1 cavalry division with a strength of 133,000 infantrymen, 8,000 cavalrymen, and 837 guns.\nThe advance led through an area whose population only endured Russian rule under compulsion. A proclamation from the Russian side, promising greater freedoms as a reward for loyal cooperation in the common Slavic cause, had faded without effect. But the hope of the Central Powers to incite a rebellion against Russian rule had not yet been fulfilled. Even the Austrian troops used in Russian Poland had found no sympathy for their \"liberation skills.\" Those with them</body>\n", "118": "\n<pageno>493</pageno>\n<header>Attack Plan and Preparations of the Russians</header>\n<body>The bridgehead gained on the Vistula bank was further expanded under constant fighting. New troops moved across the river. Opposite Kosienice, the XVII Corps had established itself, further south the III Caucasian, with them were the 61st and the 1\u00bd 75th Reserve Division. Apart from the artillery of the fortress Ivangorod (34 heavy guns), about 350 Russian guns faced about 170 German ones. Nevertheless, all further Russian attack attempts were stifled by the superior German artillery fire. General Gwert had to remind to economize on ammunition. On October 17, the situation escalated into a serious crisis due to the swelling of the Vistula; the bridge at Pawlowice threatened to break.\nThe general attack of the 2nd, 5th, and 9th Army was set for October 18; however, this day could not be adhered to. The assembly of the troops took more time than had been anticipated. The fact that the railway traffic Lublin\u2014Ivangorod\u2014Warsaw was disrupted, perhaps even completely interrupted, by German artillery fire for several days at Nowo-Alexandria seems to have increased the difficulties. However, shifts to the north placed extraordinary efforts and deprivations on the 5th, 4th, and 9th Army. The 5th Army, which was largely transported by rail and then from the area south of Warsaw, is said to have been without bread for six days. It was necessary to decide to postpone the general attack; meanwhile, at least the left wing of the 2nd Army was to advance further to open the crossing over the Vistula for the 5th Army. Thus, on October 18, the I Corps and the I Siberian Corps, further reinforced by the 13th Siberian Rifle Division, advanced along the river to attack southwards. Behind their front, the XIX Corps, the northernmost of the 5th Army, began to cross to the left bank at Karstchen. The Russian attack, which met \"stubborn resistance\" from the German 87th Infantry Brigade, found \"stubborn resistance\" and advanced only a few kilometers that day.

The German operational plan was not executable by just any military instrument. Regarding training and offensive power, the German army of 1914 was at a peak that could not easily be surpassed; however, in all other areas of armament, its further expansion in the last two decades until the outbreak of the First Balkan War had undoubtedly not been promoted to the extent that would have been possible and necessary in view of the impending world war. The feverish efforts of the last two years before the outbreak of war were able to close some gaps in the armament of the German army, but could not fully make up for what had been neglected over many years; above all, it was no longer possible to balance the unfavorable numerical ratio of Germany's own forces to the enemy's as would have been possible with a steady armament policy. Here, the aggressive spirit living in the army, which was nurtured with deliberate one-sidedness in peacetime, had to create the balance. Thus, the operational plan and military instrument stood in a healthy interrelationship with the intrinsic value of the army at the beginning of the war.\nOf decisive importance for the success of the German war plan was to keep the operations mobile; a stagnation of the offensive in trench warfare ruled out rapid decisions; according to Generaloberst v. Moltke's view, it was necessary to \"take away the momentum and initiative from the army, which we need all the more, the greater the number of enemies we have to reckon with.\" Generaloberst Moltke believed that the mobility of the overall operations in the West could only be ensured by a wide sweep of the right wing of the army through Belgium, and only in this way could it succeed in defeating the enemy in open field. \"At the outbreak of war, this offered the Germans the opportunity to leave their 'front of entrenchment.' When, after the completed deployment at the mutual national borders, the armies took the offensive on all fronts, it actually came to the clash 'in open field' so eagerly sought by Generaloberst v. Moltke, where the Germans on their decision-seeking right wing of the army</body>\n<footer>*) For more details, see \"War Armament and War Economy,\" Volume I.\n2) Generaloberst v.

The political reliability of this legion was as questionable as its combat value; its request for recognition was not rejected by the command of the German 9th Army for political reasons. It seemed, however, unlikely that the legion, in accordance with its incentives, would be useful in the intelligence service during a successful advance by undertaking actions against the Russians' rear connections, perhaps even helping to promote an uprising in the largest cities, especially in Warsaw itself. Resistance from the population was hardly to be expected during the advance; the August incidents in Kalisch and Tschenstochau remained isolated cases for which a sufficient explanation was still lacking.\nA vast and, by German standards, road-poor area had to be traversed; for the Polish land west of the Vistula had been deliberately neglected by the Russians in terms of road and railway construction with regard to national defense. Not a single continuous road with a solid substructure led to the 90 km wide river stretch from the San estuary to Iwangorod. Thus, one was almost exclusively dependent on the roads common in Russia, which were very wide but not paved. They had turned into bottomless mud due to the rain, which continued into early October, on the tough clay soil of the advance area. Motor vehicle traffic was therefore limited to a few roads, mostly running crosswise or obliquely to the front. As a substitute for the heavy German field vehicles, the combined army command had already early on requested the provision of local Galician carts with native drivers and horses. More than 3000 such \"Panje\" vehicles, drawn by small, undemanding horses, were needed to maintain supplies. It could also rely on the strategic railway Radom-Kielzy-Radom-Iwangorod, which, however, first had to be converted to the German gauge and made passable by removing the found destructions. Above all, clearing the tunnel from Miechow, destroyed by the Russians and then more thoroughly by the Austrians during their retreat, required much work. Nevertheless, it was possible to overcome all difficulties so that traffic could be resumed beyond the tunnel as early as the first week of October.</body>\n<footer>1) Volume II, p. 253, note 1. \u2014 2) Volume II, p. 49. \u2014 3) See \"The German Field Railway System\", Volume I, p. 155 ff.</footer>\n", "119": "\n<pageno>494</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>had arrived late from the San and could not advance on impassable \nroads; by the evening of the day, only infantry and twelve guns from the XIX Corps \ncould be transferred. \nHowever, the movement of Austro-Hungarian forces \nnorthward to the area of Ivangorod caused concerns for the Russian Supreme \nArmy Command. The possibility of enemy reinforcements arriving was also considered again; the transport of newly formed reserve corps in Germany may have triggered this. \nA new major attack by the enemy seemed imminent. The Grand \nDuke decided not to wait any longer; he set the Russian \ngeneral attack for October 20. Although \nnot everything could be ready for this at that time, the advance \nbegan as ordered.\nThe evasion of the Mackensen Group on the night of the 20th and \nthe Guard Reserve Corps on the night of the 21st of October was a complete surprise for the Russians.

Further east, the advance at the Pilitza came to a halt. With the 2nd Army, General Scheidemann pursued vigorously and appeared in places by the evening of the day before the new positions of the Madenius group and the Landwehr Corps, which moved from Koluszki south past the Rawka to the Pilitza. When the Russians launched an attack against these positions on October 26, they were repelled with significant losses. Meanwhile, the events at Iwangorod had begun to affect the situation south of Warsaw.\nAt Iwangorod, the 4th Army, following the Grand Duke's order for a general attack, resumed the offensive on the morning of October 20 at Kozienice and south with the XVII and III Caucasian Corps with a total strength of 5\u00bd divisions\u00b9) and soon realized that the Germans had partially vacated their previous positions; the German artillery fire seemed weaker; by evening, they could approach within a few hundred yards of their positions. Thus, the commander of the Southwestern Front already gained the impression on the evening of October 20 that the Germans were withdrawing. He was eager to expedite the river crossing of his troops. 5 Russian divisions followed the withdrawing allies from Kozienice and Iwangorod as early as October 21, albeit without pressing. In the evening, the XVII Corps reached the Walbrand line east of Pyscha-Jedlnia, south of which the III Caucasian Corps was still behind; a larger gap had arisen between the two corps. Only the lead gained by the night march of the German Guard Reserve Corps separated friend and foe. On October 22, the Russian advance was to be continued with all forces; the Ural Cossack Division and behind it the XVI Corps were to follow over the bridge at Pawlowice, the Grenadier Corps and the Transbaikal Cossack Brigade were to cross the river further north at Tarnow. The counterattack of the Dankl Army brought the Russian advance to a halt and led to serious setbacks, although the Russians were in the majority at Jedlnia. When the German Guard Reserve Corps then pushed forward from Radom over Glowno\u00dfachow just against the night of the two army groups between the 5th and 4th Army, the Russian Supreme Command became concerned, as the left wing of the 5th Army, V Corps, positioned at Gora-Kalwaria, was still behind due to the delayed crossing of the Vistula.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) See p. 477.</footer>\n", "047": "\n<pageno>422</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>\ncould. The wish expressed by the allied side to take over the rear area \nin southern Poland behind the German front could not be fulfilled, as it was \nincompatible with German interests.\nThe transmission of orders and messages proved to be much more difficult \ncompared to the conditions in East Prussia. Only a few wire lines \nwere available, almost everything had to be newly created. In view of the \nRussian cavalry roaming everywhere and the already described condition \nof the roads, motor vehicles and dispatch riders were also hindered \nand often had to take large detours. Radio stations, with which the \narmy had meanwhile been more richly equipped (almost every \ngeneral command had a station), often offered the only possibility \nto quickly bring messages and orders to their destination.\nNorth of the Vistula, the advance was to begin on October 1, \nsouth of the river, the bulk of the Austro-Hungarian army was to follow on October 3; \nits right wing army \u2014 the 2nd \u2014 was to advance from the Carpathians against the left \nflank of the Russians south of Przemysl. The forward movement thus initially aimed \nat a double encirclement of the Russian forces assumed to be on the left San and \nVistula banks from Przemysl to south of Ivangorod. The plan was based on the \nagreements made with the Austro-Hungarian army command on September 18 and 23. \nMeanwhile, the picture of the situation with the enemy began to clear up.\nThe measures of the Russians were unusually well informed. Although they \nonly sent encrypted radio messages since the Battle of Tannenberg, it was \nthanks to the archaeologist, Professor Deubner, and interpreters of the Difftront as well \nas the Austro-Hungarian general staff, through tireless efforts, that the keys to the \nRussian encryptions were discovered. Thus, Russian radio messages, as far as they \ncould be intercepted, were no longer a secret for the German and Austro-Hungarian \ncommand. Only when the Russians changed the keys, there was a short pause \nuntil the new key was also determined. In addition, in Poland, in the wide areas \nfree of troops and the population little inclined towards the Russians, \nthe intelligence service proved to be more fruitful than on other fronts. Such favorable \ncircumstances compensated for the relatively small number of German and Austro-Hungarian \ncavalry and air forces available on the left of the Vistula compared to the extent of the area \nand the strength of the enemy.\n</body>\n", "192": "\n<pageno>567</pageno>\n<header>Retrospective.</header>\n<body>possessed a strong superiority in numbers and offensive power. All prerequisites for the full success of the campaign plan seemed fulfilled. However, the supreme command did not possess the decisive energy to exploit the favorable situation; the hoped-for great and decisive success was denied; only an \"ordinary\" victory was achieved.\nThe immediately ensuing pursuit resumed the original campaign plan; by advancing the German right wing towards Paris, the enemy's western flank was to be enveloped. In the ensuing pursuit battles, the allies suffered significant blows at the lower Somme, where the impetuous Oise pressed for attack, but even these were not enough to render them incapable of fighting. Three circumstances were responsible for the lack of success in the pursuit campaign: the stalling of the left wing in Lorraine during the attack ordered by the supreme command against the French fortress front, the pivoting of the right wing southwards in conjunction with the independent turning of the 1st Army against the Oise to pursue the enemy defeated by the 2nd Army at St. Quentin, and finally the weakening of the decisive right wing by prematurely transferring two army corps to the east. This shifted the balance of power between the two theaters of war in favor of the west, without the east gaining a decisive increase in strength. The result of all these events was the difficult operational situation in which the Germans found themselves during the march past Paris, which the enemy skillfully exploited by decisively transitioning from retreat to attack. At the Marne, there was a third major clash, where the advantage of the operational situation no longer lay with the Germans but with the enemy, and during which the enemy command succeeded in seizing the initiative. It almost seemed as if the admirable strength and sharpness of the German military instrument could compensate for the inadequacy of the supreme command. However, this very advantage was destroyed by clumsy interference in the battle decision; the army was forced to retreat at the moment when, after unspeakable efforts and sacrifices, it had just seized victory. The campaign in the west, based on the Schlieffen operational plan, was mishandled! The danger and possibility arose, as at the same time on the eastern theater of war, the setbacks of the Austro-Hungarian army in Galicia had made the situation extremely tense.

Nevertheless, the aviation units of the German 9th Army, thanks to the tireless work of Major Thomsen\u00b9, were reinforced by new formations at the urging of the Army High Command. Thus, the defense against the Sch\u00fctte-Lanz airship \"Liegnitz\" on the Western Front was of little consequence; however, the weather conditions of the Polish autumn limited the use of air forces.\nThe German deployment north of the upper Vistula could not remain hidden from the Russians, as it was not reinforced by any Austro-Hungarian troops. Already on September 25, the enemy, as learned from their radio messages, had numerous reports about the \"advance of the Germans from Silesia to the east.\" They then learned from a captured German rider about the arrival of the Guard Reserve Corps from East Prussia. The German 9th Army's High Command suspected that perhaps this was why the Russian advance had not crossed the Vistula. About four Russian corps were held at Przemysl, and another had been marching back east from the Vistula since September 25. On September 28, an intelligence report indicated that Russian supplies had been stalled for about a week due to poor roads. At the same time, it became clear that large shifts to the north were taking place, with the Russian 9th Army forming a new front on the Vistula west of Krasnik with at least three corps (Guard Corps, XIV, and XVIII Corps), initially appearing to be for defense. However, there was no doubt, given the overall situation of the Entente, that the ultimate goal of these enemy movements had to be a new major offensive; the only question was the timing of its start and the extent of its expansion to the north. On the other hand, it was certain that at least eight Russian corps had fallen out before the Austro-Hungarian army to the right of the Vistula. It also emerged that on the left bank of the Vistula in southern Poland, as the German 9th Army's High Command had previously suspected, the Russian cavalry had initially been pushed back by two divisions of the border axis; only on September 25 did an infantry brigade appear to have crossed to the northern bank of the Vistula just below its mouth. There, a cavalry corps of 5\u00bd divisions under General Nowikow was united.

It would therefore have been sufficient if each of the two army groups continued the pursuit on their own, especially since a gap had already formed between them due to the lagging of the V and the Grenadier Corps.\" Initially, they wanted to \"await the outcome against Austria\" and strike the enemy at Radom, with the left wing of the 5th Army pushing into their rear over the Piliza, while the Grenadier Corps, the right wing of the 4th Army, attacked over the Vistula between Piliza and Radomta. This attempt failed due to the resistance of the German XX Army Corps and the counterattack of the Guard Reserve Corps. Meanwhile, the Russian XVI Corps and the Guard Corps had followed over the Vistula at Pawlowice and Iwangorod, and at Nowo-Alexandria, the XXV Corps began the crossing, followed by the XIV. By October 26, Russian forces on the left bank of the Vistula south of the Piliza had grown to 17 1/2 divisions, gaining an overwhelming superiority against 2 1/2 German and 7 artillery-weak Austro-Hungarian divisions. The Dankl Army had to retreat.\nOn the same October 26, the attack of the right army wing (2nd Army) was repelled before the German positions east of Lodz. It was initially not resumed. Thus, a standstill occurred on the decisive wing intended for encirclement at the moment when the enemy retreated before Iwangorod; the wing was to be reinforced first.

Conrad, Moltke had expressed the hope of being finished with France \"six weeks after the start of operations,\" or at least to the extent that he could shift the main forces to the East. It was now clear that this hope could no longer be fulfilled. Essential prerequisites for the successful execution of the two-front war had thus become obsolete.\nThese disadvantages were compensated by the great success achieved by the small German army in East Prussia. From the beginning, it had faced a difficult situation against an almost twice as strong opponent. Nevertheless, it strove to solve its task of protecting the national borders through offense. In the first encounter with the enemy at Gumbinnen, it was on the verge of securing victory under its banners when it was withdrawn by the leadership before completion. A change in command had become necessary. The new leaders faced a difficult situation. Their first act after taking command was a trip to the front lines to learn about the conditions there firsthand, particularly the state of the sword they were to wield. Thus, the new decisions were built on a sound foundation. Free from any rigidity, adapting with astonishing agility to the constant changes in the situation, the leadership proved itself in the truest sense of the word in a rarely fortunate establishment of secure execution \"from case to case.\" The operational goal, the successive destruction of the two Russian armies, was pursued and achieved with consistency and determination despite all obstacles and frictions. Despite the great numerical inferiority, the German leaders in the East succeeded in surprising the enemy with superior combat power, especially artillery, wherever they sought the decision. No demand was made on the troops that they could not fully meet. The leadership had shown sound judgment for what the troops were capable of achieving in any situation. Operation and military instrument were in constant, most fortunate interaction with each other; from this arose a firm trust between leadership and troops that withstood even the most severe tests. On this basis rested the incomparable military successes at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes, which not only freed East Prussia from the enemy in a few weeks but \u2014 what was much more significant \u2014 provided the opportunity to supply the severely shaken units there with significant forces for support and thus to have a meaningful impact on the setbacks at the Marne and in Galicia.</body>\n", "265": "\n<pageno>640</pageno>\n<header>Troop Directory.</header>\n<body>\nIntermediate Position de Chenay 111.\nSoul 16. 24. 50. 96. 100f. 104. 121. 131. 153. 356f.\nVerdun 16. 19. 24f. 50. 65. 68. 82. 93f. 96. 101. 127. 153. 276. 328. 349. 355f. 400. 576.\nFort Douaumont 68.\nGrand Couronn\u00e9 133.\nFortifications on the Middle Meuse 24f. 121. 143f. 150.\nCamp de Romains 19. 24f. 50. 64f. 68f. 95. 97f. 100f. 136. 139.\nGironville 95.\nLionville 95. 101.\nLes Paroches 19. 24f. 50. 64f. 68f. 95. 97f. 100.\nTroyon 19. 24f. 50. 64f. 68f. 95. 97f. 101.\nCommander of the 1st Region 138.\nNavy Minister 367.\nFleet 367. 371.\nBelgium.\nArmy Command 177. 221. 229. 234. 265. 268. 270. 358ff. 364ff. 370. 373. 377f. 380ff. 384. 387. 393.\nArmy 18. 139. 210. 219. 221f. 225. 229f. 232ff. 238ff. 242ff. 246. 261. 263. 265. 267. 270. 280ff. 283. 289. 291. 295f. 297ff. 303. 306. 311. 313. 357ff. 371ff. 387ff. 393. 396. 400. 578.\n1st Inf.

For the pursuit, the Supreme Army Command repeated the goal already given on October 22: Kutno\u2014Tomaschow\u2014Sandomir. The 2nd Army had already reached this line; thus, the order initially only realigned the lagging front in the middle. Only the numerous reports arriving on October 27 and 28 at the Northwestern Front about German withdrawal movements even before the right flank prompted General Russki to set this flank in motion again on the 29th. The Russian front barely extended beyond the line Kutno\u2014Lodz\u2014Tomaschow\u2014Sandomir by October 31. The engagement with the enemy was lost, \"even the cavalry failed to catch up with them\"\u00b9).\nThe Russian Supreme Army Command faced new decisions. In the direction of the lower Vistula, there was apparently a large gap in the enemy's overall front, but they did not dare to boldly push into it. Destructions hampered the forward movement, the supply lines could not keep up, but above all, the flanks of their own army front in East Prussia and Galicia did not seem too far back. Thus, the opportunity for a major strategic breakthrough remained unused. General Ivanov urged a swing against Galicia, where the enemy, it seemed, held; while the Southwestern Front cleared the table here, the Northwestern Front could conquer East Prussia by repeating the procedure attempted in August. But then doubts arose: the troops of General v. Hindenburg, just driven from the middle Vistula, regained full freedom of movement and could use the German railway network. This concern led to the armies of the center (2nd, 5th, 4th, and 9th) being set in motion again on October 31; but even this time, they were only assigned targets about 20 km forward. On November 2, the pursuit movement came to an end. While the attack continued in East Prussia and Galicia, in Russian Poland, railways and roads had to be restored before they could advance again.\nThe October campaign in the Vistula bend did not bring a major decision and probably could not bring one.

The German leaders in the East had not only fulfilled the promise given in peacetime to the Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff by Generaloberst v. Moltke, they had not only tied down 22 1/2 Russian divisions, but 34 1/2, and partially destroyed them. Thus, it was primarily the great successes of the 8th Army that saved the overall situation; the German supreme army command regained the freedom of operational decision-making; despite the initial failure of the campaign in the West, the basic idea of the original war plan for the two-front war could be maintained. The critical tension between the two theaters of war was initially resolved by mid-September. Time was gained, and the Western army thus had freedom of movement again for a considerable time.\nGeneral v. Falkenhayn immediately recognized the relaxation of the overall situation upon taking over the leadership of operations; he was determined to make a second attempt in the West to bring about a decision in the campaign. This decision was perhaps made easier for him because, as a previously one-sided observer of operations on the western theater of war, he had constantly devoted his full attention to it and was therefore inclined from the outset to underestimate the difficulties of the situation in the East.\nIt was a difficult task that the new leader of the German operations faced in mid-September in the West; from the just completed retreat movement of the German Western army, it was necessary for him to achieve a new decisive offensive operation. The belligerents faced each other at the Aisne in frontal combat at this time, while on the French Maas and Mosel, the battle was in full swing. The bold hopes that the French supreme commander had placed on the subsequent pursuit operation in the first days after the unexpected successes at the Marne had given way to a more sober assessment of the situation. \"The Germans have apparently completely preserved the strength to continue the fight,\" reported the Russian ambassador from Paris to St. Petersburg on September 17. However, the enemy leadership's intention to encircle the German right wing was already apparent.\nApparently, General v.

Further north, the Caucasian Cavalry Division was identified in the area west of Lodz.\nSince the Russians were south of the upper Vistula crossing, the attack task of the Austro-Hungarian army was facilitated, provided the enemy did not evade the blow intended for him. In this case, however, the German forces advancing north of the Vistula also had to reckon with the possibility that the turn to the south would not occur initially, that the battle would rather ignite at the Vistula below the San estuary. For this, a total of 5\u00bd Austro-Hungarian and 12\u00bd German divisions were available, parts of which had been withdrawn for flank protection against Warsaw. This German perception of the situation coincided with the intention of General v. Conrad. He wanted, as he later wrote, to proceed with concentrated striking power of around 330,000 rifles in the center, initially \u2014 as stated in his army order of October 1 \u2014 \"to attack the enemy advanced in the area west, southwest, and south of Przemysl.\" His further intention was, \"to push over the San at and below Przemysl, while the German 9th and the northern wing of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army would engage comprehensively or covering.\" For his 4th and, if possible, also the 3rd Army, he envisioned the \"later advance northward\" as a goal.\nThe attitude of Romania had to be of utmost importance for the upcoming operations. Just now, when the Russian advance had come to a halt and the armies of the Central Powers jointly launched new attacks, the leaders in the East seemed to see the moment to win over the renegade ally. It was precisely because of Romania that the Austro-Hungarian army command had demanded immediate German support in Galicia, and so Generaloberst v. Hindenburg had also wired the Supreme Army Command on September 28 that influence on Romania was urgent</body>\n", "268": "\n<pageno>643</pageno>\n<header>Troop Directory.</header>\n<body>\nTransbaikal Cossack Brigade 495f.\nUssuri Cossack Brigade 424. 433.\nSiberian Rifle Regiment 444.\nFortresses:\nGrodno 501. 504ff. 522.\nIvangorod 422. 431ff. 435f. 438ff.\n445f. 448f. 453ff. 458ff. 462. 465ff.\n475ff. 484ff. 492ff. 497ff.\nFort Wannowski 447.\nNovogeorgievsk 431. 438. 445ff. 458.\n492. 522f.\nOsowiec 404. 501f. 503ff. 508. 522f. 532.\nWarsaw 413f. 421. 424. 431f. 437ff.\n442ff. 448. 450f. 456. 458. 460ff.\n472. 477. 482. 484ff. 491ff. 498ff.\n504ff. 523. 549.\nFleet 562.\n</body>\n<footer>Ernst Siegfried Mittler and Son, Printing House G.m.b.H., Berlin SW 68, Kochstra\u00dfe 68\u201371.</footer>\n", "050": "\n<pageno>425</pageno>\n<header>Advance of the 9th Army.</header>\n<body>\nOn October 1, the Allies in southern Poland began their advance with a force of a total of 18 infantry divisions and 3 cavalry divisions. The reports from the enemy seemed to bring further clarification of their intentions. By the afternoon, it was learned from intercepted radio messages that the Russian Guard Rifle Brigade had crossed the Vistula at Sandomir to advance towards Opatow. Further forces were on the march to Sandomir; among them, the 2nd Rifle Brigade as the vanguard of the XIV Corps was to cross the river on October 2, while the Russian Guard Corps marched north on the eastern Vistula bank over the San.\nFrom these movements, perhaps also from other reports that can no longer be verified today, the German 9th Army's high command gained the impression that the new Russian offensive was now beginning. This seemed to fulfill the hopes that had been entertained. In the army order of October 1, the troops were informed that the Russian 9th Army intended \"to cross the Vistula between the mouth of the San and Ivangorod and to become offensive against the Austro-German armies north of the Vistula.\" The order further stated its own intention to \"attack the enemy army during the Vistula crossing. Quick action is required and of decisive importance.\" The advance, which had previously been directed roughly parallel to the upper Vistula towards the northeast, was now turned more southwards. For the Austro-Hungarian forces advancing on the left Vistula bank and the southern flank of the German 9th Army, it became necessary to move the marching columns closer together. On the northern flank of this army, the Frommel Corps was to continue advancing along the Pilitza, and further rear detachments were to be prepared to secure the unprotected flank.\nOn October 2, the reconnaissance of the German high command seemed to be confirmed: General Nowitnow had ordered his two cavalry groups to bring up reinforcements and, if possible, to hold them \"to give the riflemen time to strengthen their position at Opatow and to facilitate the crossing of the vanguard to the left Vistula bank.\" It was learned that the Russian 5th Army was also moving\n</body>\n", "266": "\n<pageno>641</pageno>\n<header>Troop Directory.</header>\n<body>\n1st Cav.

The campaign was therefore already ailing at the first assembly: the mass of the Austro-Hungarian army had concentrated in the narrow space between the Carpathians and the upper Vistula, but the German 9th Army had to march in immediate proximity against the will of its leaders. Political reasons had decisively influenced this. As the campaign progressed, the great numerical superiority of the Russian army on one hand, and the reduced striking power of the Austro-Hungarian army on the other, were decisive. The San and Vistula, swollen by rain, offered the Russians secure protection for any regrouping of their forces, and the fortified bridgeheads of Ivangorod and Warsaw facilitated their renewed attacks. In the area immediately east of the middle Vistula, the Russians had a relatively well-developed railway and road network, while the \"Vistula Borderland\" on the other side of the river had been deliberately neglected in every respect to create difficulties for an invading enemy. Thus, all the advantages of the theater of war in Poland fell to the Russians, and all the disadvantages to the troops of the Central Powers.\nWhen Major General Ludendorff discussed the joint operational plan with General v. Conrad on September 13, both hoped that an opportunity would arise for a strike against the right flank of the Russians. However, based on the experiences of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes, the Russians, as far as German troops were facing them, had become even more cautious than they had already been. They withdrew in time from the strike intended for them west of the San and Vistula; thus, the German attack at Opatow was a futile effort. Cautious evasion and numerical superiority enabled the Russians, despite the slowness of their movements, to build a new overwhelming attack front with a strong right wing behind the Vistula River. However, the Grand Duke from Galicia had drawn relatively strong forces, so that the roles of the German 9th Army and the Austro-Hungarian army were exchanged. This was unfavorable. General v. Freytag reported on October 19: \"The offensive initiated by the Imperial and Royal Army together with our 9th Army had to take into account the tireless resistance in the front association, that it led the Vistula for our 9th Army and parts of the Austrian 1st Army, while the main forces of the Imperial and Royal Army located on the right bank of the Vistula, through pressure on the Russian forces opposite, gave the enemy a</body>\n", "195": "\n<pageno>570</pageno>\n<header>Retrospective.</header>\n<body>tember clearly shows. \"The great and brilliant successes of the current campaign,\" it was said here, \"are primarily based on the unrestrained drive forward, which inspires everyone, from the first to the last, and which our opponents were nowhere able to withstand. This unparalleled offensive spirit will continue to enable our army to achieve the highest, to face all the contingencies of war, to impose our will on the enemy.\"\nDoubts as to whether the heavily exhausted army, after the enormous exertions and sacrifices of recent weeks, especially after the setback at the Marne and the provision of fresh strength for a new attack, were apparently not present in it. The only basis for assessing the troops was the brief report from Colonel Tappen upon his return from the front in the early morning of September 15, stating that their fighting strength was still unbroken. That was undoubtedly correct. The troops, unparalleled in heroism and discipline, had survived the severe setback at the Marne without having suffered damage to their internal structure. It was entirely different circumstances that adversely affected the combat value of the Western Army at this time. Above all, it was after the unimaginable exertions during the weeks-long marches and battles without a day of rest and without adequate supplies \u2014 as was only natural \u2014 physically severely exhausted; this was also clearly expressed in the report of the Army High Command 1 to the Supreme Army Command on the evening of September 15, which, however, only reached General v. Falkenhayn on September 16. \"Since the army,\" it was said here, \"has set out from the assembly area, it has continuously advanced in strong marches, fought almost daily, and fought several large, multi-day battles. It has not had a single day of rest until now...\" The army's units were \"completely mixed and the army exhausted\" after the last heavy fighting; it urgently needed \"a short rest and strong reinforcements,\" which until-\nTo raise the offensive power and combat readiness of the Western Army, it was absolutely necessary to provide replacements, especially of officers, due to the severe weakening of its units \u2014 individual units had lost up to 50% of their strength due to combat losses and march attrition; the infantry particularly lacked experienced platoon and company leaders. One of the most proven commanding generals of the time assessed the situation at the front based on his own extensive experience</body>\n", "196": "\n<pageno>571</pageno>\n<header>Retrospective.</header>\n<body>valuable diary entries in a letter to the Reichsarchiv as follows: \"... Without sufficient artillery effect and with infantry stretched out like a rubber band, there was no prospect of success. It is no wonder that all attacks fizzled out. The attack orders from above did not take into account the actual conditions. They were probably not known, and as far as I know, nothing was done to learn about them. This type of command from above and the setting of demands that could not be met even with the best will were quite incomprehensible. They damaged trust in the highest leadership and were more suitable for creating discontent and damaging the desire to attack. This must, as painful as it is, be stated if one is to learn from the events of that time; and for this, it is primarily necessary to show how important it is, after setbacks, to maintain close contact with the troops, to orient oneself about their combat strength and capabilities, and to show them a great goal again, for which they are willing to give their best. Energetic leadership is of course also necessary in such times; but if it overextends, and not just once, but repeatedly, its effect fizzles out just like the ordered actions. It must first learn about the sword it wants to wield and sharpen it again. I believe that my experiences will generally align with those on other fronts. ...\"\nAnd in valuable addition to this judgment, an experienced chief of staff of an active army corps from that time writes: \"... The reasons why the victorious advance up to the Marne was followed by a setback are quite simple and natural. What was previously demanded of the troops was a lot, but it was within their capabilities and was built on sound premises overall. The operation failed, not through the fault of the troops, and at the same time, their forces were exhausted. What the troops needed was rest, restoration of the partly severely shaken order, refreshing of the partly heavily thinned lines, replacement of the torn leadership personnel, ample ammunition, and trust in the higher leadership. Of all this, they received \u2014 nothing. But if even a part of these demands could be met, the higher leadership could create new healthy foundations for operations, as quickly as possible, then the old striking power would have blossomed again in surprisingly short time in new freshness. Instead, the troops received new orders in the old direction, which far exceeded their forces and which, to them \u2014 not to the leadership \u2014 were recognizable as bearing the character of hopelessness. ...\"</body>\n", "051": "\n<pageno>426</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>North, towards Sandomir, gathering, while the 9th was still assembling further north.\nThe next target for the German 9th Army was thus the Russian forces at Opatow; they expected further reinforcements and anticipated the first clash on October 4th. The Landwehr Corps, the XI Army Corps, and the Guard Reserve Corps, which had meanwhile moved to the front line, were deployed in conjunction with Austria and Hungary in the general direction of Opatow, and the XX Army Corps was also to be ready, with a division against Radom, where stronger resistance was also expected, initially adopting a waiting stance.\nOn October 3rd, the Landwehr Corps, marching in a column, reached the area 20 km southwest of Opatow; to the right, the northern wing of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army connected at about the same level up to the Wis\u0142oka estuary. To the left, ahead of the Landwehr Corps, was the XI Army Corps, with both divisions side by side, having already approached Opatow from the west to about 8 km; it faced fortified Russian positions nearby. The Guard Reserve Corps, also with both divisions side by side, had already reached the area north of Opatow, left wing towards Ostrowiez, and further north the XX Army Corps with the 37th Infantry Division beyond Il\u017ca, while the other division of this corps was staggered more to the rear around the XVII Army Corps. The reports received that day \u2014 as far as we know \u2014 could have evoked a different perception of the enemy. At Sandomir, only the 80th Reserve Division and one to two rifle brigades (Guard and 2nd) had been identified on the left Vistula bank. Flyers had reported a bridge at Sandomir and another north of the San estuary at Annopol, observing Russian columns marching north at the height of this bridge on the eastern Vistula bank. The enemy, perhaps not yet as far as previously assumed, was pushing its right wing further north, with an expected crossing at Josefow and below. Meanwhile, a radio message from the Russian Guard Corps indicated \u2014 as far as deciphering was successful \u2014 \"The crossing at Annopol is to be undertaken. This point is to be secured for the corps crossing.\"\nGeneraloberst v. Hindenburg expected to encounter enemy forces of at least two Russian corps at Opatow on October 4th, but also parts of the 38th Infantry Division of the XIX Corps, and additionally three divisions from the Cavalry Corps Nowotwo.</body>\n", "124": "\n<pageno>499</pageno>\n<header>Assessment of the Campaign against the Vistula.</header>\n<body>\nmaking the prolonged defense of the Vistula line impossible. Thus, \nthe allied army with the lesser striking force was given the main role... \nHow slight this striking force was, the German 9th Army's command \ncould not foresee at the beginning of the operations. It was still full of hope.\nWhen the Central Powers' offensive then stalled around mid-October \nalong the entire front from the Carpathians to Warsaw, while the Russians \nwere strengthening at this city and to the west of it, the German army \ncommand planned the attack over the lower Piliza along the Vistula towards \nWarsaw. This was an extraordinarily bold breakthrough operation, whose \nsuccess could still save the overall situation in Poland by the end of October. \nHowever, it would have required a strike that penetrated quickly and deeply \ninto the enemy front south of Warsaw. Whether the forces of the Imperial \nGerman troops would have sufficed for such a strike in the last third of \nOctober, given everything that had happened, is hard to determine. Since \nGeneral v. Conrad declined participation in the attack north of the Piliza, \nit did not occur. From then on, it essentially involved only a holding action. \nThis task was exemplary solved by the German 9th Army. It was already \nthe third new opponent that Colonel General v. Hindenburg faced repeatedly \nwith the same, numerically inferior, own troops. When finally the Russian \nmasses \u2014 a full five weeks after the major initial offensive in Galicia had \nconcluded \u2014 launched a new decisive attack, the steadfast German attacker \nevaded the impending encirclement at the last moment and brought the \nadvance of the overwhelming Russian front to a halt through systematic \ndestruction of roads and railways. (The Russians therefore did not regard \nthe German retreat as the result of a defeat*). The intended decisive \ndestruction was once again successful for them, as was the small German \narmy\u2019s ability to effectively strike the overwhelming opponent. And yet \nthis army could be proud of what it had achieved against a numerically \nsuperior enemy once again*).\nThe fame of the field, which had surrounded the German leaders since \ntheir victories in East Prussia, had facilitated the task of the German army \nin Poland. This was evident in the almost anxious behavior of the Russian \ncommand during the Vistula crossing and later during the pursuit.

Regarding the battles before Warsaw, the Russian historical account judged: \"Overall, the numerical superiority was on the side of the Russians; by the end of the battle, it was more than double, but due to the extraordinary activity of the Germans, this numerical advantage only led to a balance in combat success.\"\nIt is difficult today to form a satisfactory picture of the difficulties and dangers of the situation of the 9th Army at that time.

We preempted them with colossal audacity, of which history will speak, repelled their vanguards, and now do not let them cross the Vistula... It was probably the hardest time I went through; day and night the excitement and constant agitation and panics... Ludendorff and I felt each other... And then on October 18, full of pride over the achievement: 'It was the most beautiful operation of our campaign.' \u2014 And on the 29th, on the retreat: 'We are not afraid of the Russians, even if they come now in triple numbers.'\"\nThe German 9th Army had multiplied its forces through mobility. Despite the worst connections and greatest expansion, it remained firmly in the hands of the leadership. This achievement is matched by the troops, who fought, bled, and endured in an area that, on the Russian side, was designated for evacuation in the event of war, was fundamentally neglected in all respects, and therefore offered neither accommodation nor roads. Unheard-of efforts and deprivations were endured at that time, especially by the troops deployed before Ivangorod in the deep mud of the Vistula lowlands, while the bloody losses remained almost everywhere within tolerable limits. Overall, the army had lost around 15,000 men in combat in the previous campaigns, of which a substantial third at Ivangorod, somewhat less against Warsaw; however, the total loss was very high due to the extraordinary efforts. The opponent, however, had lost about 20,000 prisoners and 50 guns to the German troops alone, in addition to his bloody losses.</body>\n<footer>1) Rordorf, Warsaw-Ivangorod, p. 146f. \u2014 2) Hoffmann, Records I, p. 57 ff. \u2014 3) Cf. p. 489, note on allocated replacements.</footer>\n", "053": "\n<pageno>428</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>Reserve corps had already been halted and prepared for redeployment to the north. North of the Kamjenna section, the XX Army Corps with its 37th Infantry Division approached the river. The enemy had partly retreated southeast over Sandomir to the right bank of the Vistula, partly over a bridge in the area of Annopol, which he then destroyed. According to Simow reports, numerous Russians were said to have drowned during the crossing here. As spoils from Opatow, about 5000 prisoners and 16 guns were counted; in total, the Russians had lost more than 7000 men\u00b9).\nIn the north, the German XVII Army Corps had meanwhile occupied Radom on October 5. Here too, the enemy \u2014 two battalions of the 75th Reserve Division (main reserve Iwangorod) and two Cossack divisions \u2014 had retreated east without engaging in serious combat. Behind the German northern flank stood the Frommel Corps northwest of Radom up to the Piliza; its 8th Cavalry Division had come north of this river into the area of Rawa and east. The Caucasian cavalry division apparently standing alone opposite here had retreated towards the Vistula.\nThrough the advance of the German right wing over Opatow to Sawichost, the northern wing of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, which had originally been set for Annopol, was pushed south. It had fought back the Russian 80th Reserve Division to Sandomir. This place itself and its bridges, however, remained in enemy hands on October 5.\nSouth of the Vistula, the Austro-Hungarian army had only begun its advance on October 4. Here, Russian advance troops initially retreated without a fight behind the lower Wisloka and the upper San. It was clear that the enemy was moving further forces north behind San and Vistula. General v. Conrad therefore wished that the northern wing of the 1st Army would not be pushed further south\u00b2). On the other hand, he had reports that the enemy was making all preparations for a violent attack on Przemysl. He therefore did not want to give up hope that the Austro-Hungarian main forces would still</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Koroltkow, Warsaw-Iwangorod, p. 66. \u2014 In this official Russian account, it is reported about the events during the retreat of the Russian rifle brigades: \"Since the guarding of some accidentally captured prisoners was difficult, it was ordered to shoot them.\"\n\u00b2) Conrad V, p. 41/42.</footer>\n", "052": "\n<pageno>427</pageno>\n<header>9th Army \u2014 Battle at Opatow.</header>\n<body>and approximately one assigned Infantry Brigade and finally a Guards Cavalry Brigade. The next objective of the German leadership therefore remained unchanged: destruction of these enemy forces positioned at Opatow and to the south with their backs to the river. However, it was already apparent that this would only be a partial task, after which the army would likely need to be deployed in a more northerly direction.\nThe army order for October 4th positioned the Landwehr Corps to pass south of Opatow, the XI Army Corps through Opatow, and the Guards Reserve Corps to the north of it in the direction of the Vistula, to destroy the enemy standing west of the river. It further stated: \"On the other hand, the fighting army units must not crowd together, but their advance northward must be ensured...\" When it was then learned that the enemy was \"in a strongly entrenched position at Opatow,\" the XI Army Corps and the Guards Reserve Corps were instructed that they \"must first destroy the enemy at Opatow in close cooperation\"; only then should the Guards Reserve Corps advance in the direction specified in the army order.\nOn the morning of October 4th, the XI Army Corps alone first encountered the fortified Russian position west of Opatow. To destroy the enemy through encirclement from both sides, General v. Pl\u00fcskow wanted to wait for the approach of the Landwehr Corps, which was still somewhat behind on his right, and also called up the Guards Reserve Corps for immediate support. However, the relatively weak enemy\u00b9) did not wait for the effect of the German encirclement but began to withdraw around noon. Only through sharp wheeling of parts of the Guards Reserve Corps to the south did they manage to cut off stronger elements of the enemy. In the process \u2014 as was hardly avoidable given the course of the battle \u2014 the three German corps in the enveloping attack finally crowded together in the narrowest space and partially intermingled. It is eloquent testimony to the agility of the troops that they nevertheless managed to begin the pursuit without delay on October 5th; it led the foremost elements of the XI Army Corps on this day to the Vistula section Zawichost\u2014Josefow, while the Landwehr Corps and the Guards-</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Guards Rifle Brigade with independent Guards Cavalry Brigade and 2nd Rifle Brigade.

The Battles under General v. Schubert.\na) Situation, Task, and Intentions of the new 8th Army.\nSee Sketches 5 and 11.\nBy the order of the Supreme Army Command on September 17, the composition and command relationships of the German 8th Army remaining in East Prussia were newly regulated1). This army was tasked with the difficult job of holding the successes achieved at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes against the continuously strengthening enemy, with almost half-reduced forces, a total of 9 1/2 infantry divisions \u2014 including only the I Army Corps, the I Reserve Corps, and the 3rd Reserve Division in active and reserve troops \u2014 and a cavalry division. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg intended to solve this task as aggressively as possible. Besides the intention to take the small but important and strong Bobr Fortress Ossowiec, he was also considering advancing against the large fortress Grodno. On September 17, the last army order before his appointment as commander of the 9th Army, the Generaloberst ordered further actions on Ppasn\u00fcsch, preparation for the inspection of Ossowiec, securing the August\u00f3w Forest, and interruption of the Bjelostok-Grodno railway.\nThe new commander, General of Artillery v. Schubert2), arrived at the army headquarters in Insterburg on September 19. Major General Gr\u00fcnert, the chief quartermaster of the former 8th Army, joined him as chief of staff. The new command found the following situation:\nAccording to an instruction from the Supreme Army Command on September 16, \"all means were to be set in motion to sustainably destroy the Russian railways located in the area of the 8th Army\" and furthermore \"to initiate comprehensive railway destructions in Russia through agents.\" The order from\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) See p. 410f. and War Organization (Appendix 1). \u2014 2) Until 1911 Inspector of Field Artillery, then retired, since the beginning of the war commanding general of the XIV Reserve Corps (7th Army) in the Northern Vosges.\n</footer>\n", "127": "\n<pageno>502</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>\nOn September 17, the task of the new 8th Army was explicitly stated again as the \"securing of East and West Prussia against renewed Russian invasion.\" The main reserves from Thorn and Graudenz were to \"take over border security against their fortresses, ready for later offensive action.\"\nThe army's forces were executing the last instructions of Generaloberst von Hindenburg as follows\u00b9):\nOn both sides of the Vistula, the fortress of Thorn had advanced parts of its garrison onto Russian soil.\nThe 35th Reserve Division (main reserve Thorn), the main reserve Graudenz, and the 70th Landwehr Brigade were positioned south of Zychowno and near Przasnysz.\nThe Landwehr Division Goltz had crossed the border from Lyck in the advance against Ossowiec. It was known that in recent years, efforts had been made to rebuild its outdated facilities; the artillery equipment was unknown. The fortress had only a single, 6 km wide front, directed towards the northwest, almost impregnable due to the swampy and completely exposed Bobr lowlands. In the memorandum of the General Staff prepared in peacetime, it was stated: \"An attack over the Bobr is only possible in severe frost or prolonged drought. Otherwise, the fortress can only be taken if a crossing over the Njemen\u2014Bobr\u2014Narew line is successful elsewhere.\" Lieutenant General Freiherr von der Goltz was to demand the surrender of the fortress and prepare the bombardment. Several days had to pass before the opening of fire.\nThe 3rd Reserve Division with the 1st Cavalry Brigade was stationed around August\u00f3w and had orders to advance detachments to the southern edge of the August\u00f3w Forest. The hope of gaining the southern bank of the Bobr and thus the way into the rear of Ossowiec seemed not to be fulfilled according to the latest reports from the division. The Russians were positioned in the forest terrain directly opposite; this, however, was, as Lieutenant General von Morgen reported, \"completely swampy\" and outside the roads \"impassable for all weapons.\" The general recommended bypassing the forest via Sejny.\nThe I Army Corps had reached the area of Kalwarya and west of it in the march from Mariampol to the south, the 1st Cavalry Division (without 1st Brigade) Suwalki.\nThe I Reserve Corps with the Landwehr Division\n</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) See Volume II, pp. 303\u2014305.</footer>\n", "198": "\n<pageno>573</pageno>\n<header>Retrospective.</header>\n<body>on the right wing of the army, the decision previously sought here in vain was to be pursued again with a troop that was severely weakened and not capable of decisive attack without granting a rest period and the addition of fresh combat power. Moreover, the armies were now to attack an enemy who had not only received a strong moral boost from his success at the Marne but also stood in entrenched positions on large parts of his battlefront. Operation and war instrument thus fell into an increasingly sharp imbalance with each other. In the rapid-fire weapon and the machine gun, as well as in the artillery firing from more concealed positions behind protective shields, significant obstacles to the attack had arisen, which hindered the flow of movement in an unprecedented way. In the centuries-old struggle for superiority between attack and defense, the modern weapon effect of the latter seemed to want to give the upper hand. This had already been expressed in the border battles on the Western Front in the ongoing mobile, mostly unjustified complaints of the infantry with enemy and friend about the \"failure of their own artillery\" and in the frequent \"calls for help to the neighbor\" whenever the infantry attack stalled and the artillery effect of their own troops could no longer pave the way. If the cause of this phenomenon had perhaps become less clear in the first weeks of leadership, it was partly because at that time the infantry on both sides had advanced to attack, and the defense, except on the southern flank, had not yet been able to prove the full superiority of its weapon effect. Above all, however, the mental momentum of the German infantry in these initial battles had been so decisive that the power of movement overcame all obstacles of enemy fire effect and remained in flow despite terrible blood sacrifices. A significant contribution to this was, of course, also made by the German artillery, especially the numerically and combat-value superior heavy artillery.\nThis might have changed when the enemy, in the second half of September, also on further stretches of the battlefront, in the center of the army, had switched to defense in entrenched positions and the superior power of his modern weapons fully dominated the battlefield. The physically exhausted and, due to the heavy blood sacrifices, weakened German infantry was now unable to maintain its attack movement in flow, especially since, due to gaps in the ranks of the officers, the experienced leadership and the inspiring example of the youthful leader were missing, and since their own artillery in the</body>\n", "199": "\n<pageno>574</pageno>\n<header>Retrospective.</header>\n<body>was no longer able to support the sword firearm in fulfilling its now considerably more difficult task even approximately adequately due to the great shortage of ammunition. When the German high command, in those days, in view of the great shortage of ammunition and the difficulty of modern combat against a hated enemy, advised the heavily struggling infantry to \"abandon long-range artillery fire in their attacks, overrun the French infantry positions, and capture as much enemy artillery as possible,\" it showed how little the experiences of the preceding battles had penetrated to the high command; apparently, it had no correct idea of the difficulties of the attack against an enemy who understood how to fully exploit the superiority of modern weapon effects in defense. Now, what had already been indicated during the Battle of the Marne on the southern flank in the fight against the French fortress front and meanwhile during the battles at the Aisne on the rest of the front occurred: the offensive movement began to falter against the weapon effects of strong defensive fronts. This was clearly demonstrated by the costly attacks of September 26 and 27. One faced something completely new, the deeper causes of which were initially perhaps recognized by only a few. With the previous means, the offensive movement could no longer be maintained against the insurmountable obstacles of the new temporal weapon effects; new means and forms of attack were needed. It was only natural that the fundamental change in the balance of power between attack and defense became clear to both the leadership and the troops only gradually. The leader of the German operations was also initially surprised by this change, although since his first front experience on September 20/21, he had been constantly striving to incorporate his new insights in close contact with the high command, and for this reason, had also moved the main headquarters far forward.\nIn contrast, the enemy, well-trained in defense due to his peacetime training, was able to recognize the superiority of the defense on the southern front earlier due to his experiences; he decided to exploit it. The strength of his new enemy artillery enabled him, without any risk, to withdraw significant forces from it to direct them to his decision lines from the north. Here, on the outer flank, he set \u2014 just</body>\n", "128": "\n<pageno>503</pageno>\n<header>Situation in East Prussia, September 19.</header>\n<body>K\u00f6nigsberg (main reserve of the fortress) covered both sides of the Kowno railway on Russian soil, protecting the northern flank of the army. The 9th Landwehr Brigade occupied Tilsit; north of it, the Landsturm of the K\u00f6nigsberg fortress secured the Russian border. Behind the front, the 6th Landwehr Brigade was engaged in transporting prisoners and loot at Insterburg. It was to reach Goldap by September 22.\nAs a supplement to the permanent fortifications of East Prussia, the construction of a position for about one army corps at the southern border near Mlawa was ordered, and a similar position was to be created at the eastern border near Wirballen. Above all, work was being done with emphasis on the expanded facilities of L\u00f6tzen.\nThere was nothing to fear from the sea; there, the German fleet had the upper hand.\nFrom the enemy, as far as was known on the German side, the 2nd Army, heavily defeated at Tannenberg, with at least 6\u00bd infantry and 3 cavalry divisions, not counting the corps XIII and XV, which were partly destroyed, partly captured, as well as the reserve divisions that arrived after the battle, had retreated against the Narew.\nThe Russian 10th Army, about 6 infantry divisions and 1 cavalry division, was assumed to be at the upper Bobr, namely the XXII and the III Siberian Corps after unfortunate battles at Ossowjez and before Augustow, the newly arrived II Caucasian Corps behind them at Dombrowo, the 1st Cavalry Division at Sopozkinje. Between the 10th Army and the southern wing of the 1st Army at Olita, there seemed to be a wide gap.\nThe 1st Army, just defeated at the Masurian Lakes, about 8\u00bd infantry, 8 reserve, and 4\u00bd cavalry divisions, was distinguished behind the Niemen. At Olita, the XX Corps was identified, north of it the IV and at Kowno the III Corps, southwest of Olita the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Divisions; at Olita, as was known, the II Corps had also retreated, which had suffered particularly heavily. The 68th Reserve Division was to be added in the area of Tauraggen\u2014Schauten. Presumably, the army also included the 5th Rifle Brigade, seven reserve divisions involved in the last battles (53rd, 54th, 56th, 57th, 72nd, 73rd, and 76th), and the two Guard Cavalry Divisions.\nAgainst 10 German infantry divisions (of which half were Landwehr divisions and 1 cavalry division with the Vistula fleet, about thirty Russian infantry divisions, of which at least 29 infantry divisions (of which only about a third were reserve) and</body>\n", "054": "\n<pageno>429</pageno>\n<header>The 9th Army Reaches the Vistula.</header>\n<body>d) Measures of the Russians and Result of the German Advance.\nSee Map 14, Sketches 5 and 7.\nThe August and September battles had not brought the Russians closer to their great goal of advancing deep into Germany. However, in accordance with the London agreement of September 4, they were determined to continue the war with all emphasis. The Tsar himself said on September 23: \"I will continue the war to the utmost. To wear down Germany, I will exhaust my resources; I will retreat to the Volga if necessary.\"\nDue to the severe defeats in East Prussia and the great losses in Galicia, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, as the Supreme Commander, initially believed he had to wait for reinforcements and replacement troops before resuming the attack. France was also put off until later (in view of its own impending ammunition shortage \u2014 again in mid-September) and requested the earliest possible relocation of military operations to the left bank of the Vistula and a march into Germany. Conversely, the Russian military leadership now demanded from the French that they prevent the transfer of further German forces to the East.\nAll Russian decisions were paralyzed by the fact that East Prussia remained in German hands. The Germans were seen as the more dangerous and mobile opponent and could now, supported by a particularly efficient railway network for eastern conditions, intercept and paralyze any Russian army offensive on the left bank of the Vistula as well as one into Austria-Hungary from the flank and rear. Thus, the Russian successes on the southwestern front were by no means able to compensate for the failure in East Prussia.</body>\n<footer>1) War Archive Vienna, Study of Lieutenant Colonel v. Holy.

These armies suffered on the one hand from the unfavorable grouping of their forces, which had concentrated in the attack against the San, and on the other hand from supply difficulties and heavy losses in men and equipment, which also thinned their ranks. The result of three weeks of fighting was that \"the victors could hardly be distinguished from the vanquished\"2). In total, the Southwest Front was missing 225,000 men from the target strength of 900,000. Roads turned to mud by rain and sudden flooding on the Vistula and San rivers hampered the forward movement. Thus, the pursuit, although it still brought some spoils \u2014 the Russians report since September 14, 1500 prisoners and 100 outdated guns from the San bridgeheads4) \u2014, essentially came to a halt around mid-September at the San. Only in its lower part was this river crossed, and that without a fight by the Russian 9th Army. To the left of the Vistula, apart from border guard detachments, there was initially only the cavalry corps Nowikow with 3\u00bd divisions, which only on September 17 received a brigade of the 75th Reserve Division3) as a reserve. The commander-in-chief of the Southwest Front, General Ivanov, intended to proceed further against Krakow after the completion of the fortress Przemysl. For this, two cavalry divisions were to reinforce the cavalry corps Nowikow and during the operations, 9 to 10 corps were to cross to the left bank of the Vistula. However, since the encirclement of Przemysl would take until September 30 and since the replenishment of the troops, where the new replacements often arrived without weapons, could only be completed by mid-October, considerable time had to pass before the start of the advance. Meanwhile, the Grand Duke issued a proclamation to the peoples of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, urging them to shake off the yoke of the Habsburgs and realize their national claims5).

Nevertheless, the new commander of the German 8th Army agreed with the view presented to him by his chief of staff, an expert on the situation. It suggested that the enemy, after his heavy defeats, would not be capable of new undertakings soon; he had never carried out a systematic, powerful infantry attack, even when he was still unweakened, and his defensive resilience was still considered low.\nGeneral v. Schubert saw it as his task to conceal the withdrawal of his own forces and to keep the enemy believing that he still had the 8th Army in its previous strength before him. This also had to benefit the operations of the new 9th Army in southern Poland. He wanted to continue expanding the victories in East Prussia, as long as it was still possible, in the spirit of his predecessor. Such achievements could only be reached through bold and swift action; consideration for the troops' need for rest to boost their combat strength, almost as urgently needed as the Russians, had to be set aside; the already initiated operations should be vigorously continued.\nThese intentions were reflected in the army order of September 20. The basic idea was: attack on the right flank and in the center, defense in the north. The idea was to bring about the fall of the fortress Ossowiec by advancing the 3rd Reserve Division from August\u00f3w over the upper Bobr. To open the difficult path through the swampy terrain of the August\u00f3w Forest, the I Army Corps was to bypass these woods eastward from Suwalki via Seiny\u2014Sopockinie. The possibility of capturing the fortress Grodno by surprise attack was not ruled out by the army command. The 1st Cavalry Division was tasked with interrupting the railways leading from Grodno and Kowno to Vilna.\nIn the following days, the high command faced new decisions. On the evening of September 21, the order from Generaloberst v. Hindenburg arrived, which designated the 35th Reserve Division from Mlawa to advance over Neidenburg and operate on the left bank of the Vistula1). According to this order, the 8th Army was also to exert as strong a pressure as possible in the direction of Warsaw and, following the advance against the Warsaw\u2014Grodno railway, an advance of two to three divisions from the area of Mlawa to the south was to be undertaken.</body>\n<footer>1) See p. 414.</footer>\n", "056": "\n<pageno>431</pageno>\n<header>Measures of the Russians until September 19.</header>\n<body>\nso that it occupies Transylvania and together with Russian troops the Bukovina).\nAt the \"Northwest Front\" there were a total of 32\u00bd infantry and 10\u00bd cavalry divisions available). By September 17 at the latest, General Ruzki, the new commander-in-chief, had learned that the German pursuit against the Njemen had been halted; earlier German forces had been observed retreating there. At Mlawa, however, an enemy reinforcement was reported. Since then, General Ruzki was certain that the Germans would now continue their attack from East Prussia southward. Here, alongside the Russian 2nd Army, which had not yet recovered from the blow at Tannenberg, there was only the also depleted and not yet fully assembled 1st Army. Thus, the commander-in-chief of the Northwest Front decided, to prevent the danger of a new defeat, to retreat with the left wing to Bjelst (40 km south of Bjelostok), abandoning the Narew line. West of this, only the \"Warsaw Detachment\" (3 reserve and 1\u00be cavalry divisions) was to hold the area around this city and the fortress of Nowogeorgiewsk. \"Under strong enemy pressure,\" however, General Ruzki also wanted to abandon Warsaw and then strengthen the garrison of Nowogeorgiewsk with one of the two divisions there to two divisions, and with the other to retreat to Inwangorod. The Russian supreme command agreed with these intentions; the Grand Duke himself was with his general staff on September 19 in Bjelostok with General Ruzki. The movement was already underway when finally the commander-in-chief of the Southwest Front raised serious concerns about such an exposure of his flank. General Iwanow was concerned that his planned advance on Krakow would pose a threat to his rear. This may have been influenced by reports of the appearance of German infantry on the Warthe near Kolo and Sjerads and the arrival of \"37 troop trains daily\" in Tschenstochau).

Falkenhayn had considered similar thoughts; however, he felt compelled to reject them, as \"beside the front,\" in his view, \"due to the advantage and the good connections the enemy possessed, it was exposed from the outset to renewed outflanking\"; it also seemed \"possible to him, if the current enemy front held, to bring the northern French coast and thus control over the English Channel into German hands\"\u00b9). However, the decisive factor for him was the concern that continuing the retreat would shake the internal structure of the army. Mainly for this reason, the right wing of the 1st Army was fixed in the area around Noyon. Whether and to what extent General v. Falkenhayn's fears were justified is not to be decided here. If they were indeed justified, there was still another remedy: The deployment of the 6th Army, already assembled in and around Metz, together with the army detachment Strantz being formed in the area south of Verdun for an immediate, surprising attack across the Meuse. Here, as the German army command was aware, only weak and inferior French forces were present at that time. A simultaneous attack west of Verdun with the 5th Army, reinforced by all dispensable forces of the 3rd and 4th Armies, especially artillery, through the Argonne and west of it, offered favorable prospects. This operation required no time-consuming troop movements and was the quickest and most effective, especially since the enemy, due to regrouping to his left wing, weakened his forces elsewhere. A shielding of Verdun and a breakthrough of the enemy front were within the realm of possibility. Whether and to what extent such success would have operational effects remains to be seen here. In any case, it could be assumed with certainty that a breakthrough of the enemy front at this sensitive point thwarted all encirclement attempts by the enemy and the right German wing, which was meanwhile reinforced by the IX Reserve Corps and the I Bavarian Army marching in-</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Erich v. Falkenhayn, a. a. D. C. 11 ff.</footer>\n", "202": "\n<pageno>577</pageno>\n<header>Review.</header>\n<body>Despite being supported, it was relieved as quickly and effectively as possible. The supreme German leadership was then given the time to prepare a new decisive operation based on the changed situation and a different grouping of forces.\nThe German leadership's endeavor to hold every foot of conquered ground even under tactically unfavorable conditions had to lead over time to a stagnation of the army front already engaged in battle, without it being possible under the prevailing conditions to keep operations mobile on the outer flank and to regain the initiative. In view of both sides' efforts to make a decision on the outer flank, the German leadership could not succeed, due to the limited capacity of the persistently destroyed and so far only provisionally restored railways, in bringing superior forces to significant deployment at the decision point while rigidly holding the army front from Noyon to Verdun. General v. Falkenhayn had initially calculated that, due to the greatest performance conditions of the railway network remaining in enemy hands, a real deployment of the 6th Army in a decisive operational direction would not occur; from the beginning, he believed that the German leadership might be forced by the course of events to a gradual deployment of this army. The hope that the inner superiority of the German troops would prevail even under unfavorable circumstances could hardly be fulfilled as long as nothing was done to restore their former striking power. The newly flaring battles on the open right army flank, under continued gradual deployment of hastily drawn forces, finally led to the stubborn, sacrificial struggle for the flank and on the other army fronts to trench warfare, which then gradually also spread to the decision flank.\nThe entire Western Front threatened to stagnate indecisively in trench warfare. The terrible danger this posed for the leadership of the two-front war was by no means lost on General v. Falkenhayn; he was determined to leave no means untried to avert this danger. He saw a last saving way out of the predicament in the accelerated deployment of his last army reserve, the newly formed, still unfinished reserve corps at home on the narrow strip of \"free</body>\n", "057": "\n<pageno>432</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>Iwanow, that the army group of the Northwest Front not only remained standing, but that it supported the attack of the Southwest Front on Krakow by simultaneously advancing on Warsaw and Breslau.\nNow the Russian Supreme Military Command saw itself compelled to intervene. The 2nd Army had already retreated with its main forces to the line Lomsha\u2013Malkin, the II Siberian Corps, which had been annulled to the army, began unloading in Kle\u00dftschel, and on the lower Narew, only one infantry regiment remained in the bridgeheads of Ostrolenka, Rosh\u00e1n, and Pultusk. On September 22, the Grand Duke traveled with his advisors to a meeting with the commanders-in-chief of both army groups in Cholm, the headquarters of the Southwest Front. He looked with concern at the situation on the border against East Prussia. Against General Iwanow's intention to now advance strong forces on the left bank of the Vistula, he had reservations due to the high water, as there were no solid bridges above Warsaw. However, he complied with the wishes of the Southwest Front insofar as he ordered the retreat of the Northwest Front to be halted in view of the likelihood of a German operation \"against the middle Vistula\" and envisaged strengthening its left wing near Warsaw with two other Siberian corps. At the same time, the Southwest Front was to move an army of three corps and a cavalry division to Iwangorod. Thus, everything was initially set for defense on the Vistula.\nGeneral Iwanow designated three corps (Grenadier Corps, XVI, and III Caucasian) already pushed into the second line by the San high water to Iwangorod and initiated their shift on the eastern bank of the Vistula by foot march and rail northward, while the Ural Cossack Division took the same from the south west of the river. Among the tasks of this new 4th Army was the cover of Sandomir and the support of the Southwest Front against the north (Lomsha\u2013Ziechomow) mentioned first. Meanwhile, reconnaissance by the evening of September 24 revealed the appearance of considerable German forces in the line Sieradz\u2013Noworadomsk\u2013Miechow. General Iwanow now reckoned with the possibility of a German attack from this direction against the middle Vistula, where they \u2013 as he thought \u2013 had already been on September 29.</body>\n<footer>1) Danilow, p. 281/82. \u2013 2) Ibid, p. 296.\n3) Korol\u00edow, above, p. 22.

Schubert.</header>\n<body>to be prepared; the associated weakening of the East Prussian eastern front was to be compensated by the ongoing expansion of fortified positions. In the event of a \"still possible renewed incursion\" by the Russians, the railways from M\u0142awa to Warsaw and from Lyck to Ostrowo were to be thoroughly destroyed. On the other hand, the Supreme Army Command had suggested a naval operation against the Russian coast, which could also ease the situation in East Prussia).\nGeneral v. Schubert decided to conduct border protection at Soldau-Neidenburg initially purely defensively, but he wanted to continue trying to gain the Bobr section. On September 22, the army headquarters was moved behind the right wing to Lyck.\nIn the meantime, greater difficulties had arisen in the advance against the upper Bobr than General v. Schubert had initially assumed.\nBefore Dislowiez, the Landwehr Division Goltz had pushed the enemy back so far by September 21 that the artillery deployment could begin. Two batteries of mortars (21 cm), eleven batteries of heavy field howitzers (15 cm), and two batteries of 10 cm cannons, a total of about 60 guns, were available; they mostly rolled in by rail from K\u00f6nigsberg.\nEast of Dislowiez, however, the 3rd Reserve Division, intended for the advance through the Augustower Forest, could no longer move forward, and the hope that the impact of the I Army Corps would open the way for them dwindled more and more. The idea of reaching the rear of Dislowiez via the upper Bobr had to be abandoned. Against this fortress, it could only be a feint operation from then on. The Landwehr Division Goltz was assigned the 1st Cavalry Brigade to protect its right flank threatened from Lomsha, for which there was no longer any use in the Augustower Forest.\nThe I Army Corps had received orders from the Army High Command on September 20, while marching from Kalwaria to Augustow, to turn southeast, over Seiny to Sopoziniec, to bypass the Augustower Forest. However, in this order, General v. Fran\u00e7ois felt that the importance of the Grodno fortress was not sufficiently appreciated. He was of the opinion that a feint attack against the fortress was pointless, but a decisive attack with the available means was \"almost impossible,\" as aerial reconnaissance, apart from the permanent works</body>\n<footer>1) See p. 414 and 520f.</footer>\n", "203": "\n<pageno>578</pageno>\n<header>Retrospective.</header>\n<body>Field\" between the sea and the rest of the army front. By achieving a decisive success at this point, he hoped to break the entire remaining German front from its stagnation and also to return to a war of movement here. At the beginning of the battle in Flanders, 96 German divisions fought against 89 1/2 French-British divisions on the Western Front, excluding the remnants of the Belgian army rescued from Antwerp, whose operational capacity at that time was at most equivalent to one or two divisions; on the decisive wing at the front of the 4th Army, the Germans at that time had a superiority of six to seven divisions with very heavy artillery in terms of number and caliber, while in Artois, opposite the 6th Army, the enemy had a superiority of about five divisions. The success of the new operation was only assured if it was possible, by exploiting the initial numerical superiority in Flanders, to quickly break the enemy resistance and strike deep into the enemy's flank. The force of this attack had to be so powerful that the rest of the Allied army front, if possible, was shaken up to the Somme and began to waver. This again required a troop that was not only filled with high morale but also particularly thoroughly trained for the difficult and unique combat tasks that awaited them in sectioned and water-rich terrain against a war-experienced enemy. Such particularly demanding performance would have been just good enough for the battle-tested units of the Western Front after prior rest and preparation. It was therefore obvious to distribute the newly established reserve corps across the entire Western Front instead of deploying their battle-experienced units for the execution of the new operation, utilizing rail transport and land march uniformly, especially since, according to the head of the field railway system, the railways of the occupied territories were at that time fully capable of quickly executing such a large transport movement. A greater loss of time would hardly have occurred with appropriate measures. General v. Falkenhayn, however, determined that the newly established reserve corps would mainly carry out the decisive operation in Flanders. The responsible leader of the operations and simultaneous Minister of War could thus remain unclear about the deficiencies in training, consolidation, and equipment inherent in the young formations. He hoped, however, that surprise of the enemy and unified and powerful deployment of the</body>\n<footer>1) The German Field Railway System, Volume I, p. 133.</footer>\n", "131": "\n<pageno>506</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>\nhad established extensive field installations. The commanding general \ntherefore did not want to march on Seiny, but more to the west, on Suwalki, \nto be used from there \"depending on the situation against the enemy advancing \nagain over the Njemen.\" This intention was only reported to the army \nhigh command on September 21, when the 1st Infantry Division was already \nmarching towards Suwalki. General v. Schubert reluctantly gave his consent. \nHe abandoned the idea of using the I Army Corps to gain the southern \nBobr bank and approach the Warsaw-Grodno railway, but insisted on \nan \"advance with a strong vanguard to Sopockinie.\" The I Army Corps \ncould then be deployed against the Grodno-Wilna railway. Insofar as \nRussian security was already north of the Njemen, it was assumed by the \narmy high command that there were only troops in this direction that had \njust been heavily defeated at the Masurian Lakes; an advance over the \nNjemen seemed feasible.\nWith this plan, General v. Schubert arrived on September 22 \nat Suwalki at the headquarters of the I Army Corps. The corps had \nreached Suwalki on September 21, partly in a very strenuous march on \npoor roads, with the 1st Infantry Division, with advance troops of the \n2nd Infantry Division reaching Seiny; the troops urgently needed rest. \nGeneral v. Fran\u00e7ois raised serious concerns about the intentions of the \ncommander-in-chief; he believed that it was more appropriate for the \ncondition of the troops to let the enemy run into a position to be expanded \nin the Suwalki-Wilkowischki line, which the Russians would hardly be \nable to muster the necessary strength for. After thorough discussion, \nhowever, the commander-in-chief stuck to his decision. The I Army \nCorps, to which the 1st Cavalry Division was subordinated, was to reach \nDruskieniki on the Njemen on September 24 and \"thoroughly destroy\" \nthe Grodno-Wilna railway east of the river. A division was to cross over \nand the headquarters was to show its flag on the right bank of the Njemen. \nThe right flank seemed secured from Augustow by the 3rd Reserve Division, \nthe left had to remain open. General v. Schubert consciously accepted \nthis disadvantage. He countered, as he reported to Generaloberst v. \nHindenburg on September 24, the \"hope that the enemy might be tempted \nby this undertaking to launch a premature offensive from Olita, even from \nKowno, and that the opportunity might arise to break through with his \nright wing in the area south of Ralow.\" At Wirballen, the I Reserve Corps \nwas to be ready to engage in the battle. If the thrust over the Njemen did \nnot bring the hoped-for opportunity for a profitable...\n</body>\n", "058": "\n<pageno>433</pageno>\n<header>Russian Southwest Front until October 5.</header>\n<body>could begin, while the Austro-Hungarian army from Tarnow-Jas\u0142o could launch its attack by October 1st at the latest. The Russian Supreme Army Command initially held a different view. That strong German forces were actually present at the Silesian-Polish border did not seem proven to the Grand Duke, and even less so that the appearance of these forces was connected to a weakening of the German armies in East Prussia. Even on September 25, he still primarily expected a German offensive from East Prussia towards the south. There, General Russki had meanwhile withdrawn his 2nd Army further east despite the directives issued in Cholm, but now wanted to proceed with an attack using the 1st and 10th Armies, the right wing of his army group, to halt the German offensive feared by the Grand Duke.\nIn this situation, General Ivanov emphasized his completely divergent view by reporting to the Supreme Army Command his intention to timely evade any potential enemy advance in order to regain operational freedom. For this purpose, he wanted to withdraw behind the river sections of Vistula, San, and Tanew, and in Galicia only hold Lemberg, to either defend or to break out in a general attack after regrouping forces. These extensive withdrawal intentions met with \"the most unfavorable reception imaginable\"\u00b9) from the Grand Duke; in his view, they did not correspond to the situation, as he was now certain through observation of German railway movements that no stronger German forces had been transferred from the French to the Russian front. Above all, a withdrawal at the Southwest front was highly undesirable to him for political reasons. To prevent it, the Supreme Commander went to Cholm again on September 26. The immediate effects of the discussion there\u00b2) were that General Ivanov now pushed half of the 9th Army behind the new 4th Army northward on the eastern bank of the Vistula. The encirclement of Przemy\u015bl remained in place, and the defense along the Vistula line was to be conducted actively. It could primarily rely on the small fortress of Ivangorod, which, although abandoned, had been restored to a defensive state and equipped with artillery since August 28. As support for General Novikov's cavalry, strengthened to 5\u00bd divisions (5th, 8th, and 14th Cavalry Division, 4th, 5th Don Cossack Division, and Turkestan Cossack Brigade), the Supreme Commander therefore</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Danilov, p. 299.\n\u00b2) The decisions made here regarding the continuation of major operations will be discussed later.

Schubert wanted to withdraw the I Army Corps again and wait for the Russian advance in the Suwalki\u2013Wilkowischki line.\nThese plans assumed that the already barely sufficient forces of the army would not be further weakened. The later requested transfer of one to two divisions to Warsaw by Generaloberst v. Hindenburg would completely change the situation. General v. Schubert therefore expressed in the mentioned report of September 24 to the Generaloberst the hope \"that for the next eight days the necessity of this deployment would not arise, but only after successes against the enemy advancing from the Njemen had been achieved.\"\nIn the response from Generaloberst v. Hindenburg received on September 26, it stated: \"With the current enemy measures, it is primarily about protecting the province of East Prussia against an attack from the Grodno\u2013Kowno line for the 8th Army. A weakening of the army by deployment to Warsaw does not seem feasible to me at this time either. Therefore, Your Excellency, I have to solve your task with all the forces available to you. A use of parts of the 8th Army towards Warsaw can only occur after further clarification of the situation in front of the 8th Army's front.\" The Generaloberst again pointed out \"terrain reinforcements to the greatest possible extent\" at W\u00fcrzballen and thorough railway destructions on enemy and also on own territory, if the 8th Army had to retreat. \"In the planned destruction of the railways\" \u2014 it was added for clarification \u2014 \"I see a very essential means to decisively influence a new superior Russian offensive.\"\nGeneral v. Schubert could thus dispose of his troops unhindered for the time being. He also brought the last field troop, the 70th Landwehr Brigade, from Prasnysz to the army near Grajewo and took over the immediate protection of the border against the Russian 2nd Army from Thorn to south of Lyck with fortress troops and Landsturm.\nThe small but battle-tested and victory-conscious German 8th Army guaranteed that everything humanly possible would be done against the numerically far superior enemy. However, how long it would succeed in keeping him in check was difficult to foresee. The own ranks were \u2014 especially among officers \u2014 thinned; the enormous efforts of three battles had exhausted the forces</body>\n", "204": "\n<pageno>579</pageno>\n<header>Review.</header>\n<body>\nnew army in an operationally favorable direction, but above all the incomparable\nspirit of the young troops would compensate for their other deficiencies.\nInstead, they bled themselves dry despite all dedication in futile\nattempts against an enemy who, just a few days after the start of the\nattack, received ever-increasing reinforcements from his other\nfronts and had the experience of months of fighting on his side; he understood\nhow to use the superior effect of his now greatly increased\nartillery and machine guns to excellent effect in the terrain that made the attack so\nextraordinarily difficult. Once again, operation and military instrument\nwere out of proportion to each other. It was psychologically\nunderstandable that General v. Falkenhayn initially closed himself off to this bitter realization.\nAfter all, a failure in the West seriously called into question the\nvictorious continuation of the two-front war. In addition,\nhe was heavily burdened by the oppressive feeling of not only the setback\nat the Marne due to the stagnation of the entire German army\nfront in trench warfare into a severe operational failure,\nbut also of having exhausted the forces, whose deployment a few days after\nmobilization had been his own particular achievement, in an insoluble task\nand unsuccessfully. A major military success on the western\ntheater of war seemed all the more necessary to him, as only in this way\ncould the troops regain their former self-confidence and the feeling of absolute superiority\nover the enemy. Despite all the repeated attempts, with\nconsiderable blood sacrifices, to bring movement back into the stagnant front,\nthe circumstances proved stronger than the will to victory of the German leader. Only when,\nafter long bloody struggles, the flower of German youth in Flanders\nhad sunk down and through the floods on the decisive wing as well as the futile deployment of Group Fabel the last\nhopes, to which the German leadership clung, were destroyed,\ndid they recognize their error. The struggle for the campaign\ndecision on the Western Front remained temporarily\nundecided. This result also meant the final\nfailure of the original operational plan for the two-\nfront war.\nThe crisis in the West was exacerbated by the fact that at the same\ntime the tension on the eastern theater of war also reached its\n</body>\n", "059": "\n<pageno>434</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>the 9th Army forces in the total strength of a corps (Guard and 2nd Rifle Brigade, 80th Reserve Division and independent Guard Cavalry Brigade) were advanced to the left bank of the Vistula, where west of Ivangorod also stood half of the 75th Reserve Division and the Ural Cossack Division. Thus, apart from the Caucasian Cavalry Division of the Northwest Front stationed at Lodz, by the end of September, a total of 2\u00bd Russian infantry divisions and 7 cavalry divisions were on the left of the Vistula. They were to offer stubborn resistance to the enemy with the rifle brigades united at Opatow. It was not until October 3rd that they were ordered by the army group to retreat in view of the great enemy superiority. However, the local commander did not yet consider the situation so serious. But when he began the retreat around noon on October 4th, a costly partial defeat could no longer be avoided. All other troops stationed on the left of the Vistula could be withdrawn across the river without loss.\nThe danger that the Austro-Hungarian army feared from immediate Russian pursuit, especially from the Russians' overtaking advance on the left bank of the Vistula, had actually not existed since mid-September. The heavy losses suffered by the Russians in Galicia, the slowness of their movements, the high water of the Vistula and San, but above all the German victories in East Prussia, had decisively relieved the allied army. A German operation from East Prussia on Siedlce, as initially intended by the Hindenburg-Audendorff High Command, could not only have cleared the way in the second half of September but also had great consequences; it could have brought Warsaw and the middle Vistula probably into the hands of the Central Powers. The view of General v. Conrad that the effect of such an operation would have come too late can no longer be considered correct today.\nThe transfer of German troops from East Prussia to the Austro-Hungarian front came as a surprise to the Russians; what purpose was associated with it remained \"initially a mystery,\" as General Danilow, the then Quartermaster General and Chief of the Operations Department in the Russian field army, writes1).

It added to the fact that the German territory with its good roads and accommodations had now been left behind, and the fight had to be continued on Russian soil, with sparse and poor roads, impoverished villages, large swamp and forest areas. However, the enemy's forces had to grow from day to day. His armies, defeated in East Prussia, could organize themselves behind fortified river sections, replenish troops and equipment without being hindered; fresh troops from the Caucasus, Turkestan, and Siberia began to arrive. Thus, the success of further operations on the German side depended above all on the skill and determination of the leadership.</body>\n<header>h) The Battles from the End of September to October 3, 1914.

On September 24, the airship \"Z IV\" determined that the fortress Ossowiec was currently completely surrounded by water and swamp. Troops and horses of the Landwehr had to help bring the siege batteries and their ammunition into position. On September 26, Lieutenant General Freiherr v. der Goltz opened fire against the fortress, and on September 27, it was continued from more advanced positions. An advance by the Russians deep into the left flank of the division, against the road Grajewo\u2013Augustow, was repelled on the same day, but it showed the entire danger of the undertaking; it was all the greater as the heavy batteries on the rain-soaked roads could only be withdrawn again with great effort of auxiliary forces and time.

The success at Opatow, though welcome, was of little significance for the overall situation and remained the only outwardly prominent result of this campaign phase. Nevertheless, the Russian advance was initially halted, and thus time was gained for the German supreme command in the East without deploying new forces. The political impression made by the advance of German troops deep into Poland was also noteworthy.\n2. The Shift Northward until October 13th.\na) The Battles before Ivangorod and Warsaw until October 10th.\nSee Maps 14 and 15.\nThe battle of Opatow had eliminated uncertainty. It was clear that the enemy could no longer be grasped west of the Vistula. The German 9th Army's high command considered how to proceed with the operations. Continuing the attack across the rain-swollen river was out of the question given the strong enemy. To engage them, the impact of the Austro-Hungarian armies advancing on the right bank towards the San had to be awaited. Meanwhile, the 9th Army's high command had already initiated a shift northward several days earlier, as a counter-move against the increasingly apparent parallel Russian movement. They aimed to outflank the enemy if possible. However, whether they would still be strong enough to attack if successful was questionable. Perhaps they had to be content if they managed to draw as many Russian forces as possible to the northern flank, thereby easing the impending attack of the Austro-Hungarian army. General v. Conrad hoped to force a decision by swinging his 2nd and 3rd Armies northward, with the German 9th Army serving only as flank cover or as a \"pivot\" according to his view).\nBased on the early reports available by October 5th, the German 9th Army's high command assumed that the Russian 9th Army, with at least three corps (XIV, XVIII, and Guard Corps), was positioned behind the Vistula line Sandomir\u2014Josefow; further north, however, up to and including Kasimierz, parts of the Russian 4th Army (XVI and Grenadier Corps) had been newly identified. It appeared that this army</body>\n<footer>1) Conrad V, G. 21, 22 and 41.</footer>\n", "134": "\n<pageno>509</pageno>\n<header>The Landwehr before Ossowjez.</header>\n<body>tember, several Russian columns advanced from the Narew towards Schtschuschin; the 1st Cavalry Brigade stationed at Stawischki had to retreat. General v. der Goltz was tasked with covering the right flank of the army southwest of Grajewo.\nOn September 30th at noon, the enemy attacked the Landwehr at Grajewo. As reports of the continued march of Russian columns from Schtschuschin northwards were received, General v. der Goltz intended to retreat to Lyk. However, the commander-in-chief did not agree; he ordered a counterattack to repel the Russians and sent his First General Staff Officer, Major Englein, to Grajewo. The counterattack could not be carried out. Since the enemy from Schtschuschin must have already had a lead towards Lyk, General v. der Goltz, in agreement with Major Englein, decided to retreat eastwards over the Lyk River to Raigrod; they might then be able to engage in the battle at Augustow the next day. As the divisional staff was about to leave Grajewo as the last part at nightfall, to follow their troops over the only provisionally restored bridges of the Lyk River, they were caught in a heavy fire attack in the town. The staff narrowly escaped; motor vehicles, a gun, and other vehicles were lost in the rather disorganized retreat.\nOn the night of October 1st, the Landwehr rested at Raigrod and to the west; the 1st Cavalry Brigade had retreated over the Lyk River at Prostken to the northeast. The road Grajewo\u2014Lyk, and thus the way into the rear of the army, was open to the enemy.</body>\n<header>The Advance against the Njemen.</header>\n<body>See Map 18.\nAccording to the orders given by the army high command, the I Army Corps was to reach the Njemen at Druskeniki on September 24th; this was almost 50 kilometers of march from Seiny, where the foremost parts of the 2nd Infantry Division were located, over partly the worst roads through difficult terrain. Then the corps was to force the crossing and interrupt the railway another 18 kilometers away; at the same time, a strong detachment of all arms was to advance against Sopockinie to distract the enemy. The I Army Corps still had serious concerns about such an extensive undertaking. In view of the extraordinary efforts made previously, General v. Fran\u00e7ois requested that</body>\n", "061": "\n<pageno>436</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>\nstill north of the 9th; it then had to reach Ivangorod. This, except for two works on the western front, outdated military site was indeed abandoned as a fortress before the war, but not yet dismantled. It could still offer the enemy a strong base and secure river crossing.\nGeneraloberst v. Hindenburg decided to block the Vistula south of Ivangorod with weaker forces, hoping that the advance of the Austrians and Hungarians would soon enable the crossing there. They had, including the garrison of Przemysl, at that time 45\u00bd infantry divisions (including 1 division and 14 brigades of Landsturm), which, as was assumed at the time, still faced about 47 to 48 Russian divisions south of the San estuary. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg wanted to direct the main focus of the German operation against Ivangorod or further downstream.\nOn October 6, the corps of the German 9th Army were moved northwards from the general line San estuary\u2014Radom, while from the southern adjoining group of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, four infantry and one cavalry division moved in almost the opposite direction at Sandomir behind the retreating enemy to the southeast across the Vistula to meet with the main forces of their army.\nThe Austro-Hungarian military leadership was continuously informed about the events at the German 9th Army by Captain v. Fleischmann. Furthermore, the continuation of operations on October 6 was thoroughly discussed with Colonel Slameczka, sent by General v. Conrad. The colonel reported that the mass of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army intended to defeat the \"enemy (Russian XIV Corps) pinned in the San-Vistula angle\" and that the other Austro-Hungarian armies were also advancing. Based on new reports about the enemy, General v. Conrad, however, already considered the possibility of a timely Russian retreat behind the San later that day. In this case, the main forces of the 1st Army were to advance over the lower San towards Lublin, for which German cooperation in a comprehensive approach on both sides was requested; \"an extensive movement downwards Ivangorod, as planned by the German Army Command 9 for three corps,\" was desired for this.\n</body>\n<footer>1) Conrad V, p. 53.</footer>\n", "062": "\n<pageno>437</pageno>\n<header>9th Army \u2014 Shift to the North.</header>\n<body>There was full agreement between the German and Austro-Hungarian leadership in their understanding and intentions. Initially, however, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg had to decide, albeit with a heavy heart, to grant his troops a day of rest, as they were extremely strained by an uninterrupted, four-day rapid advance, partly with combat. Only on October 8 could the new movements begin, whose first goal was to expel the Russian forces still west of the Vistula and to attack Ivangorod.\nThe necessary expansion of the German operation to the north also required stronger measures to protect the open left flank of the army. The Frommel Corps alone was no longer sufficient for the tasks to be solved there. New, apparently Siberian troops seemed to be gathering south of Warsaw; they had to be dispersed before they could become threatening. Moreover, Warsaw itself posed a constant source of danger. This city had also been abandoned as a fortress; the works, which enclosed it in a double row with a shorter circumference of over 50 km, were outdated and mostly closed, but according to reliable reports, they had recently been partially re-established for defense. The capital of Russian Poland, with its three solid Vistula bridges, was of even greater military importance, as only a few days' marches north of the city stood the Russian 2nd Army, and good railway connections favored the rapid deployment of additional forces from the interior of the empire as well as from all parts of the Russian front directly to Warsaw. Thus, the question arose of how to deal with this place in the continuation of operations. It was known that the northern Russian armies had resumed their attack against East Prussia since the beginning of October; their forces seemed initially tied there. From the situation at Warsaw itself, reconnaissance and agent reports by October 8 had shown that Gora-Kalwaria, Grojez, Skierniewice were temporarily only weakly occupied. Also, in the city of Warsaw itself, there were supposed to be no strong forces, but only many thousands of wounded and sick, allegedly 80,000 men1); the command of the Russian 2nd Army had been from Warsaw since October 6.</body>\n<footer>1) The map of the enemy situation on October 5\" at Conrad V, Annex 2, shows more troops between Radom and Warsaw and in the city, including \"parts of the I Corps\". Whether the assessment changed by October 8 or whether it was a different evaluation of existing reports could not be determined.</footer>\n", "135": "\n<pageno>510</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>The Army High Command on the evening of September 22 again considered \"whether it is advisable to continue advancing with the army corps in an easterly direction and thereby give the enemy the possibility of a flanking maneuver from the direction of Dombrowo and Olita,\" thus from the south and north simultaneously. He considered it more prudent to lure the Russians out and then attack them. Despite these renewed objections, General v. Schubert maintained his order. General v. Francois, however, decided to allow his corps to rest initially on September 23.\nBy the evening of September 23, General v. Francois had received reports that made the fulfillment of his mission appear quite difficult. On the right flank of the ordered advance, Russian security forces were stationed at the August\u00f3w Canal, and behind them, on the August\u00f3w\u2013Grodno road, a gathering of strong troops, estimated to be a corps, was reported, along with strong cavalry north of Sopozinije. Already west of the Njemen, the raiding detachments of the 1st Cavalry Division had been repelled with losses, and halfway between Seiny and the river, mixed enemy detachments were expected to be stationed on the main roads. At Druskeniki itself, a tethered balloon indicated a stronger enemy presence. North of there, the enemy was positioned in Mere\u010d, northeast of Serje and Simno. At Olita, an enemy corps and two cavalry divisions were expected. In light of this situation, General v. Francois again suggested to the commander-in-chief to refrain from advancing over the Njemen, thus deep into the enemy's formation, and to only initiate partial advances on Druskeniki and Sopozinije. General v. Schubert, however, adhered to his orders on this day as well; he assessed the strength, combat power, and fighting spirit of the enemy as less significant than General v. Francois. He pointed out that the railway interruption was of utmost importance; \"sufficient forces\" should be deployed for this purpose, and if no ford was available, a bridge should be constructed. He considered it necessary to designate the bulk of the forward division for the crossing. As a reserve, the 3rd Reserve Division would be moved from August\u00f3w to Seiny. If the enemy were provoked into a counterattack by the thrust of the I Army Corps, it would be desirable.\nOn September 24, the I Army Corps began its advance from Seiny and secured Druskeniki up to about 20 km; it was the day when the corps, according to the first order it had received, should have already reached this location. On the left flank, the 1st Cavalry Division (without the 1st Brigade) had been securing the area near Serje for two days;</body>\n", "205": "\n<pageno>580</pageno>\n<header>Review.</header>\n<body>reached the highest degree. Due to the decisive victories in East Prussia, significant forces were freed here by mid-September. Thus, at this time, the German Supreme Army Command could also dispose of a valuable army reserve of eight infantry divisions and one cavalry division on the eastern border. Opinions differed between the German leadership in East Prussia and the allies regarding their deployment. The German Supreme Army Command decided in accordance with the Chief of the General Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army, who, strongly impressed by the defeat in Galicia, wished for the deployment of the new German army in direct conjunction with the allies, \u2014 contrary to the original proposal of the German leaders in the East, who aimed to achieve a rapid relief of the heavily shaken allied army by advancing the freed forces from East Prussia over the Narew to Siedlce in an effective operational direction. This resulted in an unfavorable starting position for the allies. Nevertheless, thanks to their operational mobility, the German leadership and troops managed to divert massive enemy forces from the allied army. The Russians turned with far superior force against the German 9th Army and gradually pushed it into defense. The decisive offensive task thus passed to the numerically superior Austro-Hungarian army in Galicia, where the focus of the overall operation now lay. However, the allied army was no longer up to the new task; its offensive power was exhausted, and the hoped-for successes in Galicia were denied.\nIn view of the overwhelming superiority of the Russians at Ivangorod and Warsaw and the impending encirclement of the German left flank, the entire operation had to be abandoned. The retreat of the 9th Army became necessary. However, for the regaining of the initiative, no sacrifice was too great for the German leaders in the East. Without any hesitation and without regard for the \"moods\" of the troops, they voluntarily relinquished almost all of Poland and large areas of recaptured territory in East Prussia. The large retreat movement was carried out in a timely manner and with a skill that did great honor to the foresight of the leadership and left the solid structure of the German officer corps unshaken.\nThe German leadership and the troops in the East had achieved the humanly possible against overwhelming superiority; on their own, they not only tied down overwhelming enemy forces but also relieved the front of the allies beyond expectations, and furthermore, they managed to keep the enemy away from their own national borders.</body>\n", "206": "\n<pageno>581</pageno>\n<header>Retrospective.</header>\n<body>\nto hold out and thereby provide the Western army with full freedom of movement for three months. Including the Landwehr, there were around 24 German divisions in the East by the end of October against about 50 Russian, with 11 in East Prussia against 20, and 12\u00bd in Poland against 30. On the entire Eastern front, there were around 92 divisions of the Central Powers against about 1201) Russian and Serbian. Considering the low combat strength of the Austro-Hungarian divisions, the ratio was even more unfavorable for the Central Powers.\nThe overall situation in the East now gave cause for serious concern. The border area in Silesia, Posen, and East Prussia was in danger of being overrun by Russian masses; the previously only threatening specter of the \"Russian steamroller\" seemed to be becoming a reality around the turn of October/November. The freedom of movement of the Western army was seriously endangered. Count Schlieffen had already stated during a war game in 1905 that the German military leadership could not calmly \"watch\" if the Russians \"marched over the Vistula, Oder, Elbe\"; then we could not \"continue the war in France\"; that was \"completely out of the question.\"\nThe main focus of the German army was clearly in the West; four-fifths of it were stationed there, only one-fifth in the East. However, the total forces of the Central Powers were almost evenly distributed in terms of division numbers between East and Southeast on one side and West on the other (92 vs. 96 divisions), only the higher combat value of the German divisions gave the West an advantage. If a unified will had stood over a unified army, perhaps a more appropriate distribution of tasks and forces across all theaters of war would have been achieved. However, it was a matter of the power resources of two independent states with different goals standing side by side. As a result, the forces were now insufficient for the tasks set in both the East and the West. \"We would,\" as Count Schlieffen had already outlined the consequences of such division more than 20 years ago, \"never be strong enough to defend, but not to achieve a decisive victory.\" The two-front war threatened to develop into a path leading to indecisive warfare in the East and West.\n\"By moving German forces back and forth from one theater of war to another, pushing back the enemy here and there, then advancing again...\" was, according to Count Schlieffen's view\n</body>\n<footer>1) Including the reserves within the interior of the Russian Empire, excluding Landwehr.</footer>\n", "207": "\n<pageno>582</pageno>\n<header>Retrospective.</header>\n<body>for the Germans, the multi-front war was not to be won. \"Such a war on two fronts cannot be ended by repelling one or the other part, but only by the possible destruction first of one, then of the other opponent.\" Generaloberst v. Moltke also saw great danger in the indecisive conduct of war on both theaters of war in the aforementioned memorandum of 1913. This would mean Germany would forgo any initiative and offensive and limit itself to a defensive battle on both fronts in a war that had to decide about its survival or downfall.\nThe failure of operations at the Marne left no doubt that the operation in the West had hopelessly stalled in trench warfare. A crisis\u2014far more serious than that of September\u2014had arisen. The extremely tense situation urged a quick decision. Considerations of the most serious kind stormed upon the leader of the German operations. Even now, there could hardly be any doubt that the two-front war could only be successfully concluded if the basic idea of the war plan, to defeat Germany's enemies one after the other, was adhered to. Now, where in the West for the foreseeable future the impossibility of achieving this goal was proven, it had to be attempted to create complete freedom of action in the East by destroying the Russians. Here the situation had changed significantly compared to the beginning of the war, as the Russians had meanwhile brought their masses from the depths of their empire to their western border and were about to launch their own decisive offensive. Evading a German flanking operation was now much more difficult for them; it was tantamount to a defeat in its effect and was therefore far less likely than at the beginning of the war. The previous operations on the eastern theater of war had taught that the Russian leadership and the Russian army were inferior to the Germans; here, the German leadership was promised the quickest campaign-deciding success, especially since the Russians were currently in a strategically unfavorable grouping. After regaining freedom of action, the more difficult task of subduing the western opponents could be resumed\u2014but then, after eliminating the danger in the East, presumably with sufficient strength.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 565.</footer>\n", "063": "\n<pageno>438</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>had been moved to the large fortress of Nowogeorgiewsk. Difficulties from the population were hardly expected in Warsaw; rather, it was believed that their assistance could be counted on. Thus, a coup against the large city seemed promising; something similar had succeeded against Li\u00e8ge at the outbreak of the war. If Warsaw was in hand, the northern flank of the army was secured, and a relief of the German 8th Army struggling against superior forces in East Prussia was expected, and finally, the capture of the old Polish capital with its 800,000 inhabitants and extensive administrative, commercial, and transport connections was also of political and economic significance.\nGeneral v. Mackensen received the order on the afternoon of October 8 to \"seize Warsaw through a rapid advance.\" His XVII Army Corps and the Frommel Corps were made available to him; at least one infantry brigade of the XX Army Corps was to follow these forces. Whether the rest of this corps could be deployed in the same direction was not entirely certain given the unclear situation on the Vistula below Iwangorod. In total, at least 4\u00bd infantry and 1 cavalry division could be counted on against Warsaw, while the 21st Landwehr Brigade and the Landsturm Brigade Hoffmann, advanced by the Border Guard of the Deputy V Army Corps, covered the northern flank of the operation at Sieniewicze and Lowitsch.\nThus, in the following days, almost half of the German 9th Army turned against Warsaw, about a quarter against the Vistula at Iwangorod, while the rest blocked the river south of this city to later join the expected advance of the allies.\nThe Austro-Hungarian armies had meanwhile continued to follow the retreating enemy everywhere. The brave garrison of Przemysl under Field Marshal Lieutenant v. Kusmanek had bloodily repelled three days of desperate attempts by the Russians to capture the fortress before the approaching relief. In the Austro-Hungarian army report, the losses of the attackers were estimated at 40,000 men. For October 10, General v. Conrad set the attack of his right wing (2nd and 3rd Army) against the enemy still standing before the fortress, the 4th and 1st Army were to take the San line below the fortress.\nThe operations of the German 9th Army led to battles before Iwangorod as well as before Warsaw.</body>\n", "208": "\n<pageno>583</pageno>\n<header>Retrospective.</header>\n<body>The conditions had fundamentally changed compared to the situation at the beginning of the war. On the western front, a solid iron wall had been erected before the German army. In the east, there was still more room to maneuver, things were still in flux, and there were still opportunities to deliver powerful blows with superior forces against weak parts of the enemy's front. Trench warfare had not yet become the all-dominant form of warfare.\nSuch considerations had to impose themselves on the German Supreme Army Command, especially when, in the last days of October, the Chief of Staff of the Austro-Hungarian army increasingly urged a shift of the focus of warfare to the east, and the development of the situation on the eastern front offered a rare opportunity in the first days of November. The German leaders in the east had unexpectedly regained their operational freedom despite the enemy's great superiority; with a sense of responsibility and determination, they were resolved to immediately seize the initiative again. Based on the repeated and firm assurances of General v. Falkenhayn at the Berlin conference, they firmly believed in an imminent campaign decision on the western front; in conscious selfless renunciation of any reinforcement from the west, they made a decision of untouched audacity. In a combination of operational mobility, the small German 9th Army was to be unexpectedly thrown against the northern flank of the Russian main army. The purpose of the new operation was to halt the threatening Russian offensive. Once again, the leaders in the east wanted to attempt to master the situation with their own strength and to win the necessary time for the western army to achieve a decision. In the east, the missing battalions now had to be replaced in the truest sense of the word by bold leadership, whose boldest example, however, included the heaviest escort losses. The risk was justified because the leadership had managed to maintain the military instrument with hardly diminished striking power despite all the bloody sacrifices.\nIn the early morning of November 4, the intentions of the commanders in the east came to the attention of the Supreme Army Command. November 4 could become a significant turning point in the conduct of the two-front war. From this day on, there could no longer be any doubt for the leader of the German overall operations that the next campaign decision had to be sought in the east.

The 3rd Reserve Division (without a regiment that remained in August\u00f3w) reached the area south of Seiny and pushed parts forward to Kopziowo.\nOn September 25, the 2nd Infantry Division found that the enemy was in a reinforced position on the eastern bank of the Njemen at Druskeniki. General v. Francois set the attack for the next day and moved the rear, 1st Infantry Division to the left next to the 2nd Division at Serje. The 1st Cavalry Division advanced south from there to be ready for the advance against the railway. A reconnaissance of the division against Mereczh led to fighting; the enemy seemed to have established a wide bridgehead on the western bank of the Njemen bend, from which he could advance at any time.\nWhen General v. Francois finally wanted to give the order to attack Druskeniki on September 26 at noon after final preparations, an air report reached him stating that the main road on the eastern bank of the Njemen from Olita via Mereczh almost to Druskeniki was covered by a column of all arms marching southwards and estimated to be an army corps. General v. Francois decided to forgo crossing the Njemen. From the south, the enemy pressed against the canal crossings at August\u00f3w and the lake narrows south of Seiny. The army command still did not consider the situation of the I Army Corps at the Njemen to be critical. The operation against the railway was to be abandoned, but the corps was to feign crossing intentions at the Njemen on September 27 to hinder the enemy from any planned evacuations. To protect the flanks, the 6th Landwehr Brigade, which had meanwhile arrived in Suwalki, was deployed to August\u00f3w, and the 1st Reserve Division of the I Reserve Corps from Kalvaria to Simno. At the I Army Corps, General v. Francois ordered feigned attacks for the 2nd Infantry Division against Sopozkinje and Druskeniki, for the 1st Cavalry Division against the bridgehead west of Mereczh. The 1st Infantry Division was to support the cavalry from Serje and probe with weak elements against the enemy positions on the road to Olita.\nThese orders led to minor skirmishes on September 27 at Druskeniki, west of Mereczh, and southwest of Olita, where the enemy retreated from the 1st Reserve Division. Meanwhile, there was no cause for concern on the Njemen front itself. However, the enemy pressed sharply against August\u00f3w, where he established a firm foothold south of the town on the western bank of the canal and advanced against the road August\u00f3w\u2014Grajevo.</body>\n", "137": "\n<pageno>512</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>rose. To keep the important crossings of Augustow in hand, the 3rd Reserve Division was to move from Seiny on the straight road through the forest back there. Meanwhile, the enemy had destroyed the bridges on this road. Late in the evening, the order had to be changed; the division was to reach Augustow on September 28 via the detour through Suwalki, a march of 60 instead of 42 km. However, with the release of Seiny, the I Army Corps lost the flank protection against the large forest area, where it suspected three Russian corps. Thus, General v. Schubert had to decide on the evening of September 27 to withdraw the I Army Corps; he hoped that the enemy would follow and that there would be an opportunity to attack his right flank.\nWhen the army order: \"I Army Corps is gradually to retreat to the line Seiny\u2014northern end of Galadus Lake\" arrived at General v. Fran\u00e7ois on the evening of September 27, he had already ordered the continuation of operations against Sopockinie, Druskieniki, and Meretisch for the 28th. He initially adhered to this order and only moved parts of his corps back to Seiny for the defensive 3rd Reserve Division.\nIn the early morning of September 28, the German troops deployed for the defense of Augustow \u2014 a regiment of the 3rd Reserve Division and the 6th Landwehr Brigade \u2014 evacuated the place before the Russians advancing from the south and east and retreated northwards. General v. Schubert sent the 36th Reserve Division of the I Reserve Corps to reinforce the southern wing towards Suwalki. He ordered the I Army Corps to return \"as soon as possible\" to the line ordered the day before. General v. Fran\u00e7ois ordered the withdrawal for the 2nd Infantry Division in two columns via Kopciowo and northwards to Seiny, for the 1st Infantry Division even further north from Sereje to the west. The 1st Cavalry Division was to conceal the movement. The retreat was difficult on partially poor and muddy roads. From the large forest in the south, the enemy made advances over the southern retreat road of the corps leading through Kopciowo, losses occurred. They had to turn north onto pathless field roads, which led over inadequate, often collapsing bridges under the vehicles between swamp and lakes to the west. In pouring rain, the corps only reached behind the Galadus Lake on September 29. The 1st Cavalry Division held in front of the left wing of the corps.\nThe operation against the Njemen thus reached its conclusion.

Gallwitz had been deployed, reinforced by the 3rd Landwehr Division of the Landwehr Corps behind the right, the reinforced 72nd Infantry Brigade of the XX Army Corps (including six batteries) on the left wing. Furthermore, seven heavy mortar batteries (30.5 cm) were promised by the Austro-Hungarian military command, but could only arrive in a few days. The Guard Reserve Corps was instructed on October 8 to \"initially advance as close as possible to Nowo-Alexandria\u2014Ivangorod.\" However, General v. Gallwitz stated in his order for October 9, \"no serious attack is intended on this day, neither on Nowo-Alexandria nor on Ivangorod, but it is merely a matter of repelling the enemy's advance troops and reconnoitering the foreland.\" For this purpose, the two Guard Divisions and the 72nd Infantry Brigade were given a line as a target, which was about 8 km from Nowo-Alexandria and about 10 km from Ivangorod from the Vistula. Northern wing on the Radom\u2014Ivangorod railway. Behind the southern wing, the 3rd Landwehr Division was to follow up.\nMeanwhile, new reports reached the Army High Command: In Warsaw, significantly stronger forces seemed to be gathering than previously assumed; at least two fresh Siberian corps had to be reckoned with there. According to another report, the III Caucasian Corps, previously used in Galicia, was to be unloaded in Ivangorod and 20 km northwest of it, at Sobolew. In view of such strength and distribution of enemy forces in the Ivangorod\u2014Warsaw section, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg decided to first concentrate all available forces against the stronger group of the enemy, i.e., against Warsaw, to force a decision there, while smaller forces were to block Ivangorod until the heavy batteries arrived and the attack could begin. According to a corresponding, apparently verbal instruction, a General Staff officer of the Army High Command arrived at the Guard Reserve Corps on October 9 at about 8:30 a.m.; there, the following was recorded about the instruction1): \"Guard Reserve Corps should soon close sharply with all means against Nowo-Alexandria\u2014Ivangorod and also against Kozienice, so that no Russian can come out here.

When, how, and where this should be conducted was not yet foreseeable. Initially, it was important to fundamentally shift the focus of warfare to the East and take all necessary measures to make the strike now planned by the Commander-in-Chief East so powerful through the immediate transfer of some combat-ready corps from the West that the German military leadership would retain the freedom of action for a long time and the meanwhile enriched and time-consuming preparations for the decisive campaign in the East could be made. This required the cessation of all attacks in the West and the transition to defense. The enemy was so weakened by the months of bloody battles that no new major enemy offensive was to be feared for the foreseeable future; according to the available reports, the Allies also lacked troops and war material. Before significant new English reinforcements could be transferred to the field, many months had to pass. This time of weakening of the western opponents had to be used to finally defeat the enemy in the East. All reports from the Western Front also left no doubt that the troops felt superior to the enemy in defense. Even on the Flanders front, the situation was completely secure at this time, as clearly emerges from a letter from an objective, not directly involved observer, Field Marshal Baron von der Goltz, to General von Falkenhayn in those days: \"I was often enough,\" it says in this report, \"in the front trenches before the Yser position, to be able to judge how things really are there. It is less bad than is often told and assumed. I found a confident, often downright cheerful mood everywhere during my visits to the troops. Now it also comes that the enemy no longer possesses any significant offensive power. His counterattacks ... can usually only be recognized by somewhat livelier infantry fire, which soon subsides again. The height of the losses is explained less by the duration of the battles than by the length of the front lines, where earlier troop parts usually come evenly to the enemy. Despite these losses and the many other departures, we are still strong enough in the first line to easily hold off the enemy where he intended to advance. In my opinion, even often on many troops of him could stronger parts backwards grant a temporary rest.\"</body>\n", "138": "\n<pageno>513</pageno>\n<header>8th Army \u2014 The Retreat from the Njemen.</header>\n<body>superiority over the enemy and a frequent overestimation of the importance of individual railway interruptions at the beginning of the war. It demanded maximum mobility from the troops. However, their strength was no longer the same as at the beginning of the war, even if they willingly gave their all. Added to this were ammunition shortages and rainy weather! The commanding general and his staff officers saw the advance over the Njemen as a \"cavalry raid,\" in whose successful outcome they had no confidence from the outset. Only two days later, as anticipated by the high command, did the foremost parts of the corps reach the Njemen at Druskeniki; thus, the advantage of surprise was called into question. The resistance of the Russians had meanwhile stiffened, and the undertaking had become more difficult and dangerous. The pressure of the Russians against August\u00f3w finally brought the I Army Corps into a rather difficult situation.\nThe losses at the Njemen and during the retreat were not light and gave cause for concern; the threat to the flanks had put nerves to a severe test. The fighting strength and spirit of the troops were not encouraged by the retreat on muddy roads in rainy weather\u00b2).\nThe Battles at August\u00f3w\u2014Suwalki from September 29 to October 3.\nSee Sketch 11 and Map 18.\nThe advance of the I Army Corps did not bring the hoped-for opportunity for a blow against the enemy. Since it remained calm in the north and the 36th Reserve Division was already marching south towards Suwalki, General v. Schubert wanted to take advantage of the opportunity now presented to attack the enemy, who seemed to be advancing far at August\u00f3w.\nOn September 29, the 36th Reserve Division, marching southwest over Suwalki, reached the beginning of Ratschki. In Suwalki, Lieutenant General v. Morgen was with half of the 3rd Reserve Division, a regiment held together with the 6th Landwehr Brigade halfway between Suwalki and August\u00f3w at Olschanka, the last regiment was with the I Army Corps. During the day, signs increased that the enemy, for his part, wanted to continue attacking north from August\u00f3w: according to intercepted radio messages, they were supposed to</body>\n<footer>1) Reliable information on the extent of the losses has not yet been determined. \u2014 2) Regarding the enemy, see p. 522 ff.</footer>\n", "065": "\n<pageno>440</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>From October 10, large marches over the Warta could be undertaken1). These troops from the Guard Reserve Corps should take, if possible, the active Guard Division; then deploy at the Vistula from the Landwehr Corps. Aircraft and 10 cm cannons were to target the unloading stations of the III Caucasian Corps.\nThis directive no longer influenced the actions of the Guard Reserve Corps for October 9. Movements were already in full swing. The idea of now immediately moving closer to the Vistula was prohibited at Iwangorod due to the counteraction of the long-range Russian fortress guns; an extension of the relief over the railway north to the Vistula also seemed impractical, as there was a lack of forces for this section, which was still more than 6 km wide. The 3rd Guard Infantry Division was set for Nowo-Alexandria, which was to march back northwest the next day. This march was questioned if they were pushed further forward on October 9 and perhaps involved in serious fighting. However, the 3rd Landwehr Division was still so far away that its deployment was only considered on October 10. These considerations prompted General v. Gallwitz to leave the previous orders for October 9 unchanged. For October 10, he ordered the relief of the 3rd Guard Infantry Division by the 3rd Landwehr Division in the closing position west of Nowo-Alexandria and the preparation of the former for the march north. He refrained from shifting other forces down the Vistula, as his troops were already spread over a good 20 km; their northern wing was to remain at the Radom\u2014Iwangorod railway.\nOn October 10 at 4:30 a.m., General v. Gallwitz received another \"oral directive from Generaloberst v. Hindenburg,\" stating that the corps should \"not expose itself to heavy losses, not attack, but close the Vistula crossing against offensives from Nowo-Alexandria, Iwangorod, Kotsienice. Concealment in this area. \u2014 Mass of the march north! Prepare all dispensable parts at the middle Vistula bend east of Kotsienice,\" where the high command expected transition attempts with an intercepted radio message. Also, the first Austro-Hungarian mortar batteries expected from October 10 onwards were to continue marching north; whether and when to expect such batteries against Iwangorod remained questionable.

Utilizing the diverse experiences and lessons from previous battles in trench warfare, all means of modern technology had to be employed in the service of defense. It was also an urgent requirement to train the troops in the west for the special and unique tasks of trench warfare according to uniform principles. The defense had to be structured in depth, and the positions made as impregnable as possible. To strengthen the Western Front, one should not shy away from giving up all those positions that had arbitrarily arisen from the halting of the war of movement, were unsuitable for sustainable defense by weaker forces, and hindered the full utilization of weapon effectiveness. Beyond such local position corrections, there was a need to straighten protruding curves on a large scale through front shortenings. However, General v. Falkenhayn rejected this demand on fundamental grounds. In his reply to Field Marshal Freiherr v. der Goltz on November 16, 1914, he said: \"Even if many lessons from this campaign may remain unproven, one is beyond any doubt, namely: Hold what you have, and never give up a foot of what you have gained. I will act according to this doctrine and, as said, do not intend to voluntarily give up any foot of land in the west.\" It was primarily such an attitude that prevented him from stripping the Western Front of personnel forces in favor of a decisive offensive in the east. After strengthening the defensive power of the Western Front, it would have been appropriate to deploy any dispensable industry and artillery in the east to make the front there as powerful as possible. Of decisive importance for any successful continuation of the two-front war was finally the immediate establishment and realization of a new, generous armament program. In a completely different way than before, the creative forces of the homeland also had to be put into the service of defending the fatherland. The goal of the new armament program should not merely be to remedy the ammunition shortage,</body>\n", "139": "\n<pageno>514</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>\nabout 1\u00bd Russian corps to advance on Suwalki, infantry with cavalry was already in the woods just south of the Seiny\u2014Suwalki road in the flank of the exhausted troops of the I Army Corps. General v. Schubert therefore wanted to withdraw the troops standing with the front to the east at Seiny\u2014Simno to the Suwalki\u2014Kalvaria road on September 30. General v. Morgen, however, was to attack the enemy at August\u00f3w with the two reserve divisions (3rd and 36th) united at Suwalki.\nFor September 30, General v. Morgen positioned the 36th Reserve Division (without a regiment\u00b9) west of the Rospuda section from Ratschki to August\u00f3w, the 3rd Reserve Division (without the regiment with the I Army Corps) was to follow behind. This allowed them to face west again and take the enemy's flank from an effective direction; the 6th Landwehr Brigade now had to defend its position at Olchanta on the Suwalki\u2014August\u00f3w road alone. The 36th Reserve Division under Major General Kruse encountered the enemy 8 km northwest of August\u00f3w; General v. Morgen turned the beginning of the 3rd Reserve Division southwest to extend the 36th to the right. Russian artillery then opened fire on the end of the marching column at Ratschki; the enemy was also advancing, east of the Rospuda towards Suwalki. Quickly deciding, General v. Morgen turned the 3rd Reserve Division east to attack the enemy at Ratschki; the 36th Reserve Division was to form a defensive front against August\u00f3w. A fierce battle erupted around the Rospuda section on both sides of Ratschki, but it remained undecided until the evening of September 30; the enemy west of August\u00f3w remained calm. On October 1, the battle at Ratschki continued. It was possible to repel Russian encirclement attempts north of the place and cross the Rospuda here. But even on this second day of fighting, it was not possible to drive the enemy, supported by concealed artillery, from his naturally strong positions.\nMeanwhile, the I Army Corps from Suwalki had also joined the battle. Its retreat on September 30 had been extremely difficult again. When General v. Francois arrived in Suwalki, he received a report from the 6th Landwehr Brigade that they were holding at Olchanta \"against strong superiority,\" but had already exhausted all reserves. He had therefore initially...\n</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) A regiment had remained with the I Reserve Corps.</footer>\n", "140": "\n<pageno>515</pageno>\n<header>8th Army \u2014 The Battle at Ratschki.</header>\n<body>the regiment of the 3rd Reserve Division, the Landwehr, was sent to assist. At the same time, there was concern for the 2nd Infantry Division, which, with exhausted troops and horses, was moving westward on the only available road through swamps and lakes, constantly threatened by the enemy in the south, who occasionally harassed their march with artillery fire. Although General v. Fran\u00e7ois was determined to repel this enemy by attack if necessary, it was noted \u2014 as stated in the corps' war diary \u2014 \"after passing through the narrowness of Tartak, there was a feeling of overall relief.\" The enemy did not press from the east. The I Army Corps halted at Suwalki and northeast of it. According to the instructions of the army high command, it was to remain there the following day, as it urgently needed rest after the previous exertions. \"Great, extraordinary marching achievements for Russian road conditions\" \u2014 as further noted in the war diary \u2014 \"combined with short night rest and poor accommodation placed higher demands on the troops than during the pursuit days of Tannenberg and Goldap. The unfavorable weather made the initially passable roads almost unusable. Special efforts must be demanded from the 2nd Division, which was set for the Niemen crossing.\" The most affected was the 1st Cavalry Division; it reported on September 30: \"Three rain bivouacs without oats, land exhausted. Due to the lack of supplies and oats for days and deep roads, artillery is now inoperative. Only step on road possible.\"\nIn such a state of the troops, a report came in on the night of October 1 at 2:30 that the 6th Landwehr Brigade was retreating north from Olschanka \"in dissolution.\" General v. Fran\u00e7ois alerted the 2nd Infantry Division and set it from Suwalki southward for a counterattack. Between the roads leading to Ratschki and Augustow, fighting occurred south of Olschanka; no decision was reached by evening. Half of the 1st Infantry Division was moved to Suwalki, the other half of this division had to bend its northern flank to the southern tip of Lake Selment\u00b9) as enemy infantry was reported advancing from the east. The 1st Cavalry Division secured the left flank at the road junction halfway between Lake Suwalki and Kalvaria.\nGeneral v.

The German high command also had to quickly come to fundamental new decisions regarding this problem. However, in the depressing feeling of sacrifices made in vain, despite all passionate and fervent will, General von Falkenhayn no longer found the strength in those gloomy November days to place the conduct of the two-front war on completely new foundations. He persisted in the old paths. Despite the clear realization of the impossibility of an early decision in the West, his gaze was still strongly directed at Ypres; his entire thinking and striving turned to more limited goals, which were extremely difficult to achieve militarily on the one hand, and on the other hand, even if achieved, had no influence on the overall operational situation of the multi-front war. Before the conclusion of the battles in Flanders, a visible success of the German arms was to be achieved through the fall of Ypres. Thus, the two-front war threatened to degenerate into a conduct of war that, according to Schlieffen's view, \"could lead to the complete attrition of the German army in the long run.\" This meant defeat and downfall sooner or later.\nTo what clear understanding of the conditions for successfully conducting the two-front war had the responsible men come in serious peace training, and what had become of it in the harsh reality, in the aggravating element of war, where will and action weigh more than insights!\nThe reasons for the indecisive conduct of the war in the West were, besides the errors of leadership, mainly to be found in the ultimately equally surprising superiority of the defense to both enemy and friend, which everywhere, where it was in the hands of a war-experienced defender, understood how to fully bring the effect of modern weapons to bear, had proven to be the stronger form of combat. With the previous means of combat, the attacker was all the less able to subdue them, as \"the German army ... had not had a fundamental peace training for positional warfare\" (The new means and ways had been found that returned to the attack its previous superiority, above all the momentum and the power of movement, which was only natural, that both opponents sought to primarily use the initially stronger form of combat, the defense. From this</body>\n", "212": "\n<pageno>587</pageno>\n<header>Retrospective.</header>\n<body>\nA trench warfare had developed along the entire Western Front; it imposed its laws imperiously on the conduct of war on both sides. It was clear that it took considerable time for leadership and troops to become familiar with the laws of this new warfare.\nIt was tragic that the strong relationship of trust between leadership and troops, which had grown in the East from the consciousness of great shared experiences and achievements, could not develop in the West as circumstances were. Leadership and troops were faced with tasks here that, after the setback at the Marne, could only be solved with an immediate and completely fundamental adjustment to the changed combat conditions if the supreme command demonstrated a similar operational flexibility in mid-September as the leaders in the East. In the tenacious defense of every foot of conquered ground, the troops in the West had to make heavy bloody sacrifices. In fierce struggles, they had performed acts of the highest self-sacrifice. Just as the army in the East, they too experienced their highest ambition in fulfilling every demand of the leadership, enduring even the hardest, on lost posts. The self-evidence with which the German soldier went into battle and death at the command of the leadership revealed the spirit of utmost dedication that filled the entire army of 1914. Nevertheless, the set goal in the West was not achieved.\nThe further development of the operational situation now depended primarily on the outcome of the struggle for Opera and the impending battles in the East.\n</body>\n", "067": "\n<pageno>442</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>West of Ivangorod, the Russians held back. Here, the 1st Guard Reserve Division had extended with the northern wing up to the railway, while the 72nd Infantry Brigade of the XX Army Corps had been moved north to counter expected enemy crossing attempts at Krosniew. The radio message, through which the Army High Command had knowledge of them, had already been intercepted on the evening of October 9 and stated that the III Caucasian Corps had received orders that morning to transfer a regiment and a battery to Krosniew. Consequently, by 7:30 p.m., the telephone order had been issued to the Guard Reserve Corps to occupy the place immediately. However, this order did not reach the General Command until the morning of October 10 for unclear reasons. Thus, the departure of the 72nd Infantry Brigade could only be ordered on that day at 5:45 a.m., and its commander, Major General Schaar, finally set out with the foremost infantry at 8:45 a.m., more than 13 hours after the departure of the radio message ordering the movement from the Army High Command. At noon, the brigade engaged in battle at Samowoshe against an opponent who had already entrenched himself in a bridgehead-like position here\u00b9). The battle remained undecided until the evening.\nFor the operation against Warsaw, the German Army High Command had recommended to General v. Mackensen on October 8 to deploy his troops \u2014 initially only the XVII Army Corps and the Frommel Corps with the 8th Cavalry Division \u2014 north of the Pilitza on October 9, so that on the 10th, with very strong marching performance in several columns, they could reach the line Piaseczno-Nadarzyn (about 13 km from the outer fortifications and 20 km from the center of the city of Warsaw) and begin the attack on the city itself on the 11th. If the operation did not succeed as expected, Warsaw should be sealed off on the south side, the railways leading from Skierniewice and Lowitsch should be sustainably destroyed, and as strong forces as possible should be prepared for crossing the Vistula at Gora-Kalwaria. But shortly after the departure of this order, a Russian radio message came into the hands of the Army High Command on October 8 at 9:00 p.m., which already</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) According to Russian sources, a Caucasian infantry brigade.

The enemy had advanced from Kazimjerz across the river to Janowice and simultaneously attacked the 3rd Guard Infantry Division on the road leading west north of Nowo-Alexandria. Parts of the 4th Landwehr Division of Lieutenant General v. B\u0153gener, which was adjacent to the south, turned against the Russians at Janowice, but failed to drive the enemy back here. The Russian attack was repelled early in the morning by the 3rd Guard Division. Since the division was to be withdrawn and a forward movement of the closing line was not intended, the division commander, Lieutenant General v. Bornin, left at the request of General v. Gallwitz, who was himself present on the battlefield, approved this decision; he deployed the incoming 3rd Landwehr Division to attack the southern flank of the Russians west of Nowo-Alexandria and determined that the 3rd Guard Division should only engage in combat with artillery and parts of its right wing as the situation required.\nUpon receiving news of the enemy's attack near Nowo-Alexandria, the army command issued the order at 12:00 noon: \"The main thing is to throw the enemy into the Vistula today and clear the western bank. For this, if necessary, the 3rd Guard Division can remain there and does not need to be relieved.\" Immediately afterward, the commander-in-chief inquired why the 3rd Guard Division was not attacking; everything else must now take a back seat. When this inquiry reached General v. Gallwitz, who was directing the battle separated from his staff, he decided to deploy the division without restriction. However, it was 2:30 in the afternoon before the division commander could issue the attack order; only 2\u00bd hours remained until dark, but 8 km had to be covered in the attack to reach the Vistula. Meanwhile, the pressure from the 3rd Landwehr Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Baron v. K\u00f6nig, against the Russian southern flank had already forced the enemy to retreat. In a costly battle that continued deep into the night, Landwehr men, as well as grenadiers and fusiliers of the 3rd Guard Division, supported on the northern flank by the 15th Reserve Brigade of the 1st Guard Reserve Division, drove the enemy back to the bridgehead of Nowo-Alexandria. He finally held only on the heights immediately west of the Vistula on the main road.</body>\n<footer>1) For Russian activities see p. 459.</footer>\n", "141": "\n<pageno>516</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>Lyc to Goldap, had postponed this change due to the events on the southern wing until October 1st. Meanwhile, the overall situation of the army had become increasingly difficult. The enemy had not only attacked at Gumbinnen but also at Grajewo, where the withdrawal of the Landwehr Division Goltz to Raigrod had opened the way to the rear of the army; furthermore, he was now also moving against the northern wing of the army. A far superior enemy was advancing in a continuous front. However, the own army was stretched over a width of 80 km with its limited forces and had no reserves. If it were to be torn apart in skirmishes on Russian soil, any serious setback could be disastrous. Such considerations led General v. Schubert already on the night of October 1st to the conviction that it was necessary to gradually withdraw the army to the L\u00f6tzen\u2014Angerapp position. The events of October 1st dispelled even the last doubts: Serious reports arrived from the Landwehr Division Goltz (including the 70th Landwehr Brigade); it had not marched east from Raigrod to Augustowo early on October 1st, but had evaded northwards over the Reich border to Kallinowen before an enemy reported from the south and reported that it was \"completely exhausted, both combat and movement incapable\" and lacked supplies and ammunition. Furthermore, the news of the retreat of the 6th Landwehr Brigade was received. The situation with General v. Morgen was still unclear. The I Army Corps, exhausted by previous efforts, hoped to move with parts to the south and was also tied down by a superior enemy, who now seemed to follow in a broad front from the east. In addition, General Otto v. Below, the commanding general of the I Reserve Corps, reported in the evening that he was beginning the retreat from Kalvaria to Mariampol to Wirballen due to the threat of encirclement. The demand of the High Command to instead deploy the 1st Reserve Division to support the I Army Corps from Kalvaria to the south and only withdraw the K\u00f6nigsberg Landwehr Division to Wirballen, he could no longer comply with. The center of the German army fighting at Ratschki\u2014Gumbinnen was deprived of its flank protection both in the south and in the north. With eight to nine corps, the enemy seemed to be advancing to encircle this center. However, among the own forces, four Landwehr Brigades, which the army commander had previously counted on, were apparently in a condition that excluded any use in the open field for the foreseeable future. In this situation, General v. Schubert decided not to wait any longer with the retreat to the Angerapp position.</body>\n", "068": "\n<pageno>443</pageno>\n<header>General v.

What \nother reports came in could not be confirmed. However, a situation report \npresented to the Guard Reserve Corps during the oral instruction on the \nmorning of October 9 showed the High Command's view at that time: \nAlmost 50 km southwest of Warsaw, at Grojec and Mszczonow, \nthe four battalions were in trenches, with heavy artillery also deployed at \nGrojec; the situation between both places remained \"unclear\". Southwest \nof Przasnysz stood the Russian I Corps; the II Siberian Corps, \nbeginning a new deployment, gathered south of Warsaw. Such strength \nof the enemy at Warsaw forced the strengthening of the left army wing, \nas Warsaw was the key to the Russian Vistula front. \nNot only the two available brigades of the XX Army Corps \nwere to follow there, but also parts of the Guard Reserve Corps if possible. \nTo address the increasingly felt lack of cavalry on \nthe northern flank, the Army High Command turned on \nOctober 10 to the allied army command, where eleven cavalry divisions \nwere still standing in and behind the front, without any prospect of \nappropriate use. General v. Conrad willingly provided the 3rd and 7th Cavalry Divisions \nand placed them under Field Marshal Lieutenant Edlen v.

Mackensen had learned from the Army High Command that aircraft had identified a Russian bridgehead and troops on the eastern bank of the Vistula near Gora-Kalvaria; countermeasures were inevitable. In addition to the cavalry of the XVII Army Corps, the half of the 41st Infantry Division advancing from the south at the end of the XX Army Corps, reinforced by the 87th Infantry Brigade of the 35th Infantry Division, was to turn against Gora-Kalvaria. However, the latter division had meanwhile been attacked south of Piasieczno by Siberian riflemen<sup>2</sup>. It could no longer withdraw its 87th Brigade from the action, so that finally only half of the 41st Division (74th Infantry Brigade) under the division commander, Major General Sonntag, marched against the new Russian bridgehead. After about 50 km of daily marching, it reached the area 15 km southwest of Gora-Kalvaria on October 10, only around 11 p.m. The XVII Army Corps and the Frommel Corps were positioned this evening in a width of about 10 km south of Piasieczno, where the enemy had been pushed into defense but still held, halfway to Mschtschowno\u2014Nadarzyn. Behind the XVII, half of the XX Army Corps (37th Infantry Division) had immediately followed over Grojez. On the western flank of the Mackensen group, the 8th Cavalry Division was set against the enemy marching from Skierniewice to Warsaw. The 21st Landwehr Brigade had reached the area of Rawa, the Landsturm Brigade Hoffmann Glowno (halfway Lodz\u2014Lowitsch).\nImportant Russian documents were captured on the battlefield of Grojez on October 10. From them, it was immediately deduced that at least 4 Russian corps (I, II, XXIII, II Siberian) were to be expected in the Warsaw area, with at least 1\u00bd on the western bank of the Vistula, others at the crossings of Gora-Kalvaria above, and at Jablonna below Warsaw.

The Russian attack operations across the Vistula, whose focus was increasingly extending northward, and the reports of newly arriving reinforcements of the enemy near Warsaw had raised increasing doubts about the success of further attacks. The focus of military operations shifted more and more to the left for the own army, into the area of Warsaw, while a corresponding relief occurred at the Austro-Hungarian front. An effective blockade of the 180 km long Vistula stretch from the San estuary to Warsaw had so far only been successful south of Iwangorod. West of this place, west of Nowo-Alexandria, at Iwangorod itself and at Kosienice, the enemy was still on the west bank of the river. At Kasimierz, it might have been just a diversion attempt, as a bridge had not yet been built there; at Nowo-Alexandria, however, where the Russian Grenadier Corps was stationed, flyers reported a bridge, and at Iwangorod, where the III Caucasian Corps and reserve divisions were stationed, two of them including the railway bridge; at Kosienice, no bridgehead had been established so far, but at Gora-Kalwaria. At Warsaw, two new Siberian corps had already been reported on October 9, east of the city the enemy had at least three divisions available by October 10 and was still reinforcing. Whether it would be possible under these circumstances to capture Warsaw seemed quite doubtful. There was no doubt that the enemy was carrying out a major reorganization of his forces; one had to be prepared for a general attack to begin soon. In this situation, the order captured at Grojec in the evening brought surprising clarity. Four Russian armies, the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 9th, were gathering behind the Vistula from the San estuary to Nowogeorgiewsk to advance, and were largely already ready to do so.

At the same time, the right wing of this division managed\nto gain the Rospuda crossings south of Ratschki.

Morgen also had to abandon further combat. After burying the dead, he began the retreat; his troops had lost 46 officers and 1571 men in dead, wounded, and missing.\nAt the I Army Corps, General v. Fran\u00e7ois had ordered the continuation of the attack on Augustowo for October 2nd, but it had not been executed. The eastern wing of the 2nd Infantry Division had been pushed back north by a strong enemy during the day; only in a position 5 km south of Suwalki was the division commander, Lieutenant General v. Falk, able to reorganize the defense on this wing. The right wing, however, held its ground; the advancing attack of the 3rd Reserve Division had driven three Russian batteries (18 guns) and more than 2000 men as booty into its arms.\nMeanwhile, General v. Fran\u00e7ois had already been informed by a telegram from the Army High Command at 9 a.m. that he should not \u201cexploit his success south of Suwalki; the Supreme Commander places more value on the fact that the Army Corps can be withdrawn from the battle in good condition to be capable of new tasks\u201d1). Given the overall situation of his corps and the setback on the left wing of the 2nd Infantry Division, but still unaware of the successes on their right wing and with the Morgen Corps, General v. Fran\u00e7ois had therefore already ordered the march westward at 3:30 p.m. Around 5 p.m., the 1st Infantry Division moved out, followed by the 2nd during the night; the enemy did not press.\nThe departure of the I Army Corps was not reported to the Army High Command, although there was telephone communication. Thus, General v. Falk only learned of it in the afternoon. He was called to the telephone by the Supreme Army Command on October 1st. General v.

Schubert had replied that his situation was not particularly favorable at the moment, he was himself encircled; but they should just let him be; he would \"extricate himself and later carry out the requested operation.\" When the enemy did not press strongly at any point of the encirclement front on October 2, the retreat no longer seemed urgent to him. He halted the march of the Landwehr and intended, as he reported to the Supreme Army Command in the evening along with the victory at Ratschki, to \"rest tomorrow at the border on Russian territory.\" The battle at Ratschki was to be brought to a full conclusion. In the army order for October 3, it was stated: \"The Morgen Corps will advance at dawn in an easterly direction, throwing the opposing enemy back into the forest area together with the 2nd Infantry Division.\" Initially, the I Army Corps was to gather in the direction of Ratschki, ready to repel an enemy advance from the south; the 2nd Infantry Division was to follow the 1st Infantry Division withdrawing to the west. Only when this army order reached the I Army Corps in Filipowo around midnight did the army leader learn that the corps was already in full retreat.\nOn October 3, a more reliable assessment of the situation was established. It turned out that the III Siberian Corps had been defeated at Ratschki; 3500 uninjured prisoners and 24 guns had been reported as booty. At Grajewo, the enemy still held back, and General v. Schubert went to General v. Francois in Filipowo. On the way there, the high defensive capability of the border lakes was particularly evident; in such terrain sections, even the Landwehr could repel the enemy. When the commander-in-chief then learned in Filipowo that the enemy from Suwalki had barely followed, he decided to carry out the defense intended at the Angerap already at the national border. \"No further step back!\" was his verbal instruction to the army corps.\nSince the enemy in the south could not be grasped, General v. Schubert now decided on a strike in the north. This corresponded to a simultaneous proposal by General v. Below, who recommended a comprehensive attack against the Russian northern group advancing on Wirballen. General v. Schubert wanted to concentrate all available forces against them, while the southern flank remained in defense in the meantime. This was under the command of Lieutenant General v. Morgen on the morning of October 4, with his 3rd Reserve Division, the Landwehr Division, and the 6th and 70th Landwehr Brigades in the naturally strong defensive section up to</body>\n", "001": "\n<header>The World War</header>\n<body>\n1914 to 1918\nEdited in the\nReich Archive\nThe Military Operations on Land\nFifth Volume\nPublished by E.

Corps and II. Siberian Corps, perhaps also IV. Corps, as well as I. and IV. Siberian Corps), now advancing over the line Nowogeorgiewsk\u2014Plitza-M\u00fcnchung in a generally southwestern direction, northern flank towards Lodz, to attack. South of the 2nd Army, the 4th Army (Grenadier, XVI., XVII. Corps, III. Caucasian Corps, 75th and 81st Reserve Division) was to advance with the southern flank on Starhyslto (== Bzin), south of Iwangorod the 9th Army (Guard, XIV., XVIII. Corps, 60th, 82nd Reserve Division) and apparently also the 5th Army. With such a distribution of forces by the enemy, the hope dwindled that the German 9th Army could still succeed in attacking the Russian northern flank to achieve victory. However, it had now attracted such a strong enemy that the way seemed paved for the advance of the Austro-Hungarian army. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg had to be content if he managed to hold off the overwhelming enemy on the Vistula front long enough for the allies to achieve victory.\nThe Austro-Hungarian army now had only the Russian 3rd and 8th Army and the \"Siege Army\" formed from contributions of both, previously used against Przemysl, in front of its front on the right bank of the Vistula. The enemy had abandoned the encirclement of the fortress and retreated to the northeast and north. The Austro-Hungarian army command had set its 2nd Army on Lemberg in the south, the 3rd and 4th in a more northern direction. The 4th and 1st Army were to overcome the lower San in the attack. The execution of this enterprise had already been somewhat delayed and was now set for the night of October 11th. The Austro-Hungarian and also the adjoining German troops (XI. Army Corps) standing below the San mouth on the Vistula were initially to participate through feigned operations, but then also to cross over themselves and carry the attack on the eastern bank northwards. For this, the German XI. Army Corps and the 43rd Infantry Brigade of the 22nd Infantry Division, already on the march to Swole\u0144 as army reserve, were subordinated to the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army from October 11th.

In the attack against the enemy northern group, \nbesides the I Reserve Corps (including the 36th Reserve Division), \nthe entire active I Army Corps was to participate as much as possible, as well as the Landwehr \nDivision K\u00f6nigsberg and the 9th Landwehr Brigade, which had been stationed at Tilsit, \nall in all about 5\u00bd divisions of infantry.\nThese plans changed on October 4. As the \nenemy advanced against Batajarschewo and Filipowo, General \nv. Francois wanted to postpone the march north of the 1st Infantry Division \nordered by the High Command to first \"clear up\" these \nenemies. General v. Schubert could not entirely dismiss this necessity; he ordered that the I Army Corps should \nrepel the enemy but not pursue them beyond their current positions. However, the Commander-in-Chief held firm to the decision for a later attack on the northern \nflank. In the army order from 2 p.m., it said: \"The Army High Command wants to seek the decision at Wirballen;\" for this, the 1st Infantry Division, as ordered yesterday for today, \nimmediately moves out. General v. Francois takes over with the 2nd Infantry \nDivision, 6th Landwehr Brigade, and Landwehr Division Goltz the protection \nagainst Swalki from south of the Rominter Heath up to and including \nBatajarschewo.\" The I Army Corps was also to keep in mind the detachment \nof the 2nd Infantry Division and its readiness behind the left \nflank to also march north.\nThis army order was the last to bear the signature of General \nv. Schubert. Shortly thereafter, a telegram from the Supreme Army \nCommand arrived, calling him for \"personal consultation\" to the Great Headquarters. \nHe did not return to his post from there1).

However, after having to initially abandon this plan at the end of September, he did not return to it later\u201c). It turned out to be impossible to manage operations of another army far away in the East from southern Poland alongside the difficult operations of one's own army. In Warsaw, the only option left was to try to push the enemy back behind the outer fortress belt with the available forces. For a certain time, a defense seemed possible, but not its duration.\nThe uncertainty of the situation before Iwangorod as well as before Warsaw prompted preparations for a possible retreat. General Ludendorff and Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann, his first assistant, were particularly convinced that thorough destruction of all transport facilities could significantly slow down the enemy's pursuit, perhaps even bring it to a complete standstill temporarily. Only in this way could one hope, if retreat became necessary, to regain distance from the enemy and operational freedom. To achieve such an effect, however, extensive work had to be done in the Polish area, which was poor in transport facilities. It was advantageous that preparations for their re-destruction had already been made simultaneously with the restoration of the railways and bridges. But even with these, one had to march early, accepting the unfavorable impression on the fighting troops and disadvantages for the supply. The demolition of the cross railway Lodz\u2014Bzura had already been ordered to protect the flank when the advance against the Vistula was still ongoing. The main supply railway of the army, the double-track line via Kielzy\u2014Radom to Iwangorod, had just become passable up to Bzura and was supposed to reach Radom by October 13. However, for the last 25 km before Iwangorod, destruction was now ordered, although the attack against the fortress had to be definitively abandoned, which made it more difficult. Further north, the railways from Siernewize and from Lowitsch to Warsaw, which were irrelevant for the army's operations anyway, were to be thoroughly destroyed, starting as publicly as possible. Corresponding instructions were already issued on the evening of October 10\u201c), because from that point on, it was clear what had to come.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 414. \u2014 2) See also p. 417 and 506f.\n3) For more details see \u201cThe German Field Railway System\u201d, Volume I, p. 159ff.</footer>\n", "072": "\n<pageno>447</pageno>\n<header>9th Army \u2014 Threatened by Overwhelming Attack.</header>\n<body>It became increasingly difficult for the German High Command to determine whether the allied 1st Army could ultimately carry out the attack across the San, and even if the crossing succeeded, a relief of the German front on the Vistula was only to be expected gradually, as several Russian positions had already been identified on the eastern bank of the Vistula below the San estuary, including those facing south. However, if the 1st Army's operation stalled, one had to wait until the attack of the other Austro-Hungarian armies became noticeable. This could take a week or more.\nThe German 9th Army was now likely to rely on its own strength for an extended period against a numerically superior enemy. Everything depended on preventing a surge of Russian masses accumulated east of the Vistula from crossing the river, especially from Warsaw and Nowogeorgiewsk. The main threat lay on the northern flank. To free up troops for this, one had to manage with minimal forces further south. The enemy had to be pushed back across the river here, their bridgehead destroyed, and the crossing points blocked. At Ivangorod, Nowo-Alexandria, Kosienice, and Groz-Kalvaria, the attack against the Russians on the west bank was already underway. According to the captured Russian camp map, another bridgehead at the Pilitza estuary seemed to be in question, against which forces were also deployed. It was hoped that the attacking power of German troops would succeed in throwing the enemy into the river at all five points.\nThe situation at Ivangorod was more difficult. Of the expected Austro-Hungarian mortar batteries, the first had turned north, and others had not yet arrived\u00b9). For the time being, one had to be content with defense behind the Russian bridgehead position, which lay in a river bend and was over 10 km wide, with Fort Dammowist providing strong support. Whether this defense could be maintained long enough with the available forces was questionable.\nAgainst the enemy at Warsaw, immediate cooperation of the German 8th Army, which remained in East Prussia, might now have been considered, similar to how Generaloberst v.

The originally intended involvement of a reinforced infantry brigade of six battalions, two squadrons, and three batteries had to be abandoned, as preparing the necessary transport ships would have taken too long. The planned landing of a mixed troop formation had to be canceled; the operation was now to be limited to \"a demonstration with the available naval forces...\" and \"excluding even small landing operations.\" For this purpose, a replacement battalion of 750 men still in training was embarked on the battleships of the V Squadron in Danzig.\nOn September 24, parts of the fleet appeared before Windau and began preparatory measures for a landing; the operation was to continue the following day. However, when reports came in during the night, consistently reporting the entry of English naval forces into the Kattegat, the Grand Admiral felt compelled to return swiftly to the western Baltic Sea to confront the new enemy. Even when the mentioned reports soon proved false, the once-abandoned operation was not resumed due to the landing difficulties recognized at Windau. Whether this brief feint operation had any effect remains unclear. In a Russian account\u00b9), it is stated: \"What prompted the German ships to come so close to the coast remained unclear, as they withdrew after a short time without undertaking anything.\" Had the initially planned landing of an entire brigade been carried out, the result might have been different, and thus a relief of the battlefront might have been possible.

The army command had ordered support for the 4th Landwehr Division by the Guard Reserve Corps, on whose right flank the 3rd Landwehr Division was fighting, for October 11. The measure was unnecessary when the advancing units of the 4th Landwehr Division found the western bank of the Vistula at Kazimierzsh already cleared of the enemy on the morning of October 11. The troops of the 3rd Landwehr and the 3rd Guard Division took the bridgehead of Nowo-Alexandria and captured prisoners. At both locations, the Russians had withdrawn their troops to the eastern bank as much as possible during the night, but at Nowo-Alexandria, the Grenadier Corps still lost more than 3000 prisoners and 17 guns. The bridges had been destroyed by the Russians, the one at Nowo-Alexandria apparently having been rendered unusable by a hit from German artillery beforehand. Thus, the threat south of Ivangorod was eliminated, and the active 3rd Guard Division, albeit after considerable effort and losses, was free for use elsewhere since the afternoon of October 11. Overall, the battles at Kazimierzsh and Nowo-Alexandria cost more than 2000 men.\nAt Ivangorod itself, the enemy remained calm, although two bridges and the fortifications on the western bank of the Vistula offered favorable crossing and deployment opportunities. Aerial reconnaissance had indicated that no large troop concentrations were present in the fortress area. However, the closure of its western front had not yet been completed in its northern parts. Here, the Vistula flows through a wide lowland, which had been partially turned into a swamp by rain. The river itself is accompanied on the left bank by a high embankment, which blocks the view of the water surface and the eastern bank and simultaneously offered a strong defensive position. From this embankment, one was still several kilometers away; at Kosienice, a stronger enemy held it occupied over a width of about 7 km. Major General Schaer had only been able to achieve minor successes with his 72nd Infantry Brigade by the evening of October 11.

Only the\nintervention of the Supreme Army Command prevented the implementation of this intention.\nIn anticipation of a German attack from East Prussia to the\nsouth, the Grand Duke ordered on September 25th that the\nright wing of the Northwestern Front, 1st and 10th Army, should attack again, and\nadvance to the border on October 3rd and push the enemy back behind the line\nof the Masurian Lakes.\nWhen General Ruzki received this order, his armies were\ndistributed with 36 infantry divisions and 11 cavalry divisions over more than\n500 km of front from Riga to Nowogeorgiewsk as follows:\nThe 1st Army under General v. Rennenkampf stood with 11\u00bd cavalry\ndivisions of General Radko, the III, IV, II, XX Corps and\nthe XXVI (Reserve) Corps, the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Division on\nthe Njemen from Kowno to south of Merech. The army had, including\nthe forces held ready for coastal defense at Riga and Schaulen and the\ngarrison of Kowno, a total of 14\u00bd infantry divisions and\n4 cavalry divisions.\nThe 10th Army under General Flug stood with the XXII, II Caucasian,\nIII Siberian and I Turkestan Corps from Druskeniki to\nwest of Bjelostok. It counted, including the garrisons of Grodno\nand Olitawe, 10 infantry divisions and 2 cavalry divisions.\nTheir troops had suffered the least so far, two of their corps had\nnot fought at all.\nThe 2nd Army under General Scheidemann stood with advance guards\non the Narjen, with the main body of the VI, XXIII, and I Corps south of\nLomsha to the Bug; behind it, the II Siberian Corps arrived at Kleschtscheli.\nThis army comprised 8 infantry divisions and 3 cavalry\ndivisions.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) Correspondence Januschkewitsch-Suchomlinow in Krasny Archive I, p. 245.\n</footer>\n", "003": "\n<header>Introduction to the Fifth and Sixth Volume.</header>\n<body>The present fifth volume and the soon-to-be-published sixth contain the depiction of the autumn campaigns of 1914 on both theaters of war. After the simultaneous setbacks at the Marne and in Galicia around mid-September, the close interactions between West and East become so pronounced that the previous method of describing the events on both theaters of war for specific periods in separate volumes had to be abandoned to clearly reveal the major connections of the multi-front war, especially the crisis-induced tensions of the overall situation. In the future, each volume will therefore depict the events of an operational period on all theaters of war simultaneously and coherently. In this process, the activities of the Supreme Army Command, insofar as they concern the overall war leadership, will be presented separately from their leadership on the individual theaters of war, so that the diversity and versatility of the tasks assigned to them become clearly apparent.\nTo avoid making the entire work too extensive, the depiction of events on the battlefronts is significantly shorter than before. While the great significance of the war of movement in the West up to the Battle of the Marne and in the East up to the liberation of East Prussia warranted a more detailed depiction of the battles along the entire front, these are now only described in more detail in those parts of the battlefront where their outcome was significant and influential on the operational decisions of the supreme command.

Mackensen had wanted to continue the attack on Warsaw on October 11, despite the stronger enemy forces identified there, focusing on the right wing of the XVII Army Corps. At the same time, however, he had to decide to turn the 1\u00bd divisions of the XX Army Corps, which had meanwhile been assigned to him, eastward against the Vistula, where a bridgehead at the Piliza estuary was expected according to renewed Russian orders. To prevent this, the commanding general of this corps, General v. Scholtz, had already received orders from the army high command. General v. Mackensen also instructed him to turn right with the enemy at Gora-Kalwaria, as this was of decisive importance for carrying out the attack on Warsaw. However, after the marching efforts of the last few days, the attack at Gora-Kalwaria did not get underway so soon. The half 41st Infantry Division (74th Infantry Brigade) detached here had already set out again after a short rest at 6 a.m. and only engaged the entrenched enemy on the western Vistula bank after a 15 km march at noon. Later, extending on both sides, the 37th Infantry Division (without the Infantry Regiment 147 of the 73rd Infantry Brigade sent against the Piliza estuary) joined the battle. But then the approaching darkness forced the postponement of the attack to the next day.\nMeanwhile, the XVII Army Corps and the Frommel Corps encountered stubborn resistance in their advance on Warsaw on October 11. The enemy strengthened at Piasieczno. Thus, the attack of the 35th Infantry Division made little progress here, and the place itself remained in Russian hands. The 36th Infantry Division and the Bredow Division were also only able to push the Russians back into the woods northeast and north of Nadarzhyn. The 35th Reserve Division, whose advance had first loosened the enemy in front of the Bredow Division, fought its way to Brwinow (halfway between Nadarzhyn and Blonie) and gained the Warsaw\u2014Skierniewice railway line. By the evening of October 11, they had come within about 10 km of the outer fort belt of Warsaw. The army high command had already indicated on October 11 that it was no longer a matter of capturing a city, but rather of pushing the enemy into the city and enclosing them there. Accordingly, General v. Mackensen had ordered to exploit tactical successes further.</body>\n<footer>1) According to Korolkow, Warsaw-Ivangorod, p. 101, the 5th Siberian Division fought here; it lost a total of about 5000 prisoners and 20 guns (cf. note p. 451).</footer>\n", "004": "\n<pageno>VIII</pageno>\n<header>Introduction to the Fifth and Sixth Volume.</header>\n<body>The transition from movement to trench warfare required a somewhat more detailed appreciation of the battles at the front than in the East.\nThe description of the events with the opponents provides only an operational overview without details of the battles.\nThe historical commission has tasked General of Infantry a.

General Ruzski did not yet consider the time ripe for such a regrouping of his forces, as he still had six to seven German corps in front of him. However, he decided to reject the German advance against Druskieniki and Olwyoz, and to begin the attack of his 1st and 10th Armies immediately, without regard to the still incomplete preparations, rather than on October 3. On September 28, these two armies, a total of 16 infantry divisions and 3 1/2 cavalry divisions with a combat strength of 145,000 men and 750 guns, began their advance on a 250 km wide front. The 1st Army advanced over the Njemen, the right wing over Kowno, the left over Druskieniki. The 10th Army moved through the forest of Augustow; from it, the II Caucasian and the XXII Corps, along with the 1st Cavalry Division, turned against Kopciowo\u2014Seiny, the III Siberian Corps, reinforced by a brigade, a cavalry brigade, and half of the I Turkestan Corps against Augustow, the other half of this corps against the Germans at Olwyoz. The next day, parts of the 2nd Army, VI Corps, and 4th Cavalry Division also moved forward from Lomsha, while this army otherwise had to cover the left flank. This maneuver threatened the three Landwehr brigades of General v. der Goltz near Grajewo with encirclement. Whether the combat strength of the Landwehr would have sufficed to master the difficult situation in a bold counterattack, at least temporarily, seems doubtful despite the numerous heavy artillery available to the German commander here.\nThe advance of the Russian 10th Army against the flank of the German I Army Corps, which was still at Druskieniki at the time, posed a very serious threat to Krahny; it was only mitigated by the fact that the Russians did not dare to give the right wing of their army a more n o r t h e a s t e r l y direction from the outset.

The 8th Cavalry Division, deployed in this direction, \nhad been fighting against the enemy identified at Skierniewice for two days; \nhowever, it had not succeeded in diverting him to Warsaw1). The division, \nwith heavily fatigued horses, was still about 10 km east of Skierniewice on \nOctober 11, in the same area it had reached on the 8th. Lieutenant General \nWoyrsch had continued the march with the 21st Landwehr Brigade to Skierniewice; \nthe Landsturm Brigade Hoffmann had been subordinated to him and reached Lowitsch.\nAt the A r m y C o m m a n d, October 11 completed the picture of the \nimpending Russian attack and simultaneously brought the disappointment \nthat the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army had postponed the San crossing again \nby two days, to October 13, as heavy artillery and bridge trains were not \nyet in place due to road conditions. Whether and when to expect the crossing \nbecame increasingly questionable. On the other hand, it became clear that \nthe Russians north of the San estuary had been greatly weakened. Thus, \nthe German High Command conceived the idea of now also moving allied \nforces northward to strengthen the front against Warsaw. Generaloberst \nv. Hindenburg had therefore, on October 11, two divisions from the Austro-Hungarian \n1st Army in exchange for the German XI Army Corps subordinated to this army2). \nHowever, General v.

During this \nadvance, there were battles south of Suwalki and northwest of Augustow, as already \ndescribed\u00b9). The German Morgen Corps initially faced about 1\u00bd infantry divisions and the 1st Cavalry Division \nat Ratschki.\nThe commander-in-chief of the Russian 10th Army, General Flug, considered \nthe situation so promising that he decided, against the explicit \nwishes of General Ru\u00dfki, to let the III Caucasian and the \nXXII Corps from the east, and a division of the III Siberian Corps from \nthe south, attack Suwalki as early as October 2.

General v. Francois escaped the dangers of this situation by \nwithdrawing on the afternoon of October 2.\nIn assessing the battles of Augustow\u2014Suwalki, it should be noted \nthat the Russian corps deployed here, with the sole exception \nof the XXVI, were not significantly affected by the major defeats in East Prussia, \nsome even arriving only after these and thus were completely fresh. \nThey faced experienced and battle-hardened German troops, \nwhich, however, were partially significantly weakened by losses in previous battles and extraordinary \nefforts. This was particularly true for the troops of the I Army Corps, which had been engaged in \ncontinuous movement combat for more than six weeks and now had to be \nconstantly redeployed from the retreat from the Njemen. \nAdditionally, coordination in action between the I Army \nCorps and the Morgen Corps was not achieved.

However, the enemy, upon recognizing the threat looming behind them, managed to relieve pressure at a decisive point in time. Nevertheless, the victory of Lieutenant General v. Morgen succeeded in significantly damaging parts of the enemy, who had previously felt little of the sharpness of German weapons, through bloody losses and captured spoils.\nOn the Russian side, the spoils of the battles of Suwalki\u2014Augustow are reported as 1000 prisoners and two guns along with a motor vehicle. However, a much larger result was intended. Regarding the actions of the 10th Army, the Chief of the General Staff of the Army wrote to the Minister of War: \"Mr. Flug has a screw loose; he has created an ideal situation. Again, we miss an Ulm. Russki is in despair. Tomorrow we will go there to settle accounts. A veritable doom hangs over the northwest front.\" Whether such an assessment of the independent actions of the 10th Army was justified seems doubtful to us in light of today's knowledge of the situation.\n\"To be modest, to be content with the indeed very beautiful success, and then to disengage from the enemy\" \u2014 this was how General v. Schubert understood the task of the German 8th Army, and given all the circumstances, one can hardly fault him for this.\nAt the moment when he ordered the retreat of his army, consisting of only 8\u00bd infantry divisions and 1 cavalry division, into a defensive position at the Reich border, a total of 20 to 22 Russian infantry divisions and 6\u00bd cavalry divisions were advancing against them.\nThe German army leadership had fully succeeded in concealing the weakness of the German troops until September 27. At that time, the enemy still reckoned with 6 to 7 corps, while including garrison and fortress troops, at most 4\u00bd corps stood before them. However, in the long run, the own weakness could not be concealed even through offensive operations. For their execution, General v. Schubert had gathered everything that was achievable, even at the ruthless exposure of other front sections.

The situation now appeared serious. It was crucial to deploy sufficient forces to Rosjienice before the enemy could reinforce too much there. At 10 o'clock, the Guard Reserve Corps received orders to march there immediately with as many strong units as possible; however, a field artillery regiment had to remain at the disposal of the artillery-weak Landwehr Corps. The 43rd Infantry Brigade of the 22nd Infantry Division of the XI Army Corps, stationed as army reserve at Swolen, was alerted and also marched north at the disposal of the Guard Reserve Corps. Since their troops were housed in numerous individual farms, it took considerable time before they could begin the march. Meanwhile, General v. Gallwitz had already set the 15th Reserve Infantry Brigade of the 1st Guard Reserve Division and, following it, the 3rd Guard Infantry Division in motion, which, exhausted from the battles of the last two days, had just come to rest. In pouring rain, on muddy roads, mostly with empty stomachs and after insufficient rest, the march proceeded slowly northward through the darkness.\nThe 72nd Infantry Brigade had received an immediate order from the Army High Command to \"absolutely prevent\" the Russian crossing of the Vistula; without knowledge of this order, their General v. Gallwitz later ordered them to \"evade from the west.\" He hoped to then effectively flank the advancing enemy from the south. When the troops of General v. Gallwitz arrived on the morning of October 12, the brigade was still in its previous position, only the left flank had been slightly withdrawn by Major General Schaer to avoid being outflanked; his troops were very tired. The enemy, who had held back until now, was now attempting to attack. Major General Schaer sent a corresponding radio message to General v.

The commanding general wanted to focus on the left flank, where he hoped to avoid the enemy encirclement. Initially, however, he deployed the first arriving 15th Reserve Infantry Brigade on the right flank to quickly bring the 72nd Brigade into combat.

Apparently, there are only a few, but their tenacity and impudence are incredible\" \u2014 so wrote the Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Army to the Minister of War\u00b2). However, the German 8th Army's offensive operations could not significantly influence the Russian measures; the Russian superiority was too strong, and they were aware of it. The exhausted German forces could only hold their extended positions as long as the enemy did not attack seriously and with full force.\n2. The Battles under General v. Fran\u00e7ois.\na) The Change in Command and the Battles of the Southern Wing until October 8.\nIncluding Sketches 12 and 13.\nThe German Supreme Army Command received the report from General v. Schubert about the victory at Ratschki and the intention to \"rest\" on Russian territory at the border on October 3, at 4:30 in the morning. Then followed a victory report from General v. Fran\u00e7ois\u00b3). He saw the victory primarily as an achievement of his corps, whose 2nd Division had captured significant booty. From the discussion with the Commander-in-Chief, he had the impression that despite the victory, the latter was determined to withdraw the army further. However, he saw this as a misfortune. From the beginning of the war, he believed that the East Prussian border had to be held, and he was convinced that this goal could still be achieved despite enemy superiority. Thus, immediately after the discussion with General v. Schubert, he decided to take the unusual step of reporting directly to the Supreme War Lord\u00b3): \"The I Army Corps, in conjunction with the 3rd and 36th Reserve Divisions, defeated the enemy in a two-day battle at Suwalki. At the I Army Corps\n</body>\n<footer>\n\u00b9) This referred to the Germans. \u2014 \u00b2) Krasny Archive I, p. 233.\n\u00b3) General v. Fran\u00e7ois argues in a letter to the Reichsarchiv that this step was justified for commanding generals in the Prussian Army, because: \"The position of the commanding general was an immediate position, which included direct reporting to the Supreme War Lord in wartime. This immediate right was developed in the supreme interest of national defense and was abolished with the World War by a Supreme Cabinet Order.\" However, it should be noted: The \"immediate position\" of the commanding generals, at least as far as it\n</footer>\n", "078": "\n<pageno>453</pageno>\n<header>Guard Reserve Corps near Kosienice, October 12.</header>\n<body>also from the expanded bridgehead of Iwangorod along the Vistula\nembankment. To the left of the 15th Reserve Brigade, General\nv. Gallwitz had positioned the 3rd Guard Infantry Division, with the 43rd Infantry\nBrigade as the outermost left wing, on Ispynka-Wolka and northwest.\nHowever, since the Guard Division was marching in the column behind the 15th Reserve Brigade\nand its artillery found it difficult to position in the softened lowland,\nits attack started late. It encountered the simultaneous attack of the Russians\u00b9)\nand soon got stuck in the mire of the Vistula lowland in the face of enemy fire,\nthe onset of darkness, and continuous rain. By evening, Germans and Russians\nwere facing each other closely. A continuous Russian position extended\nfrom Siejechow, connecting to the outer defenses of the fortress Iwangorod,\nalong the Vistula embankment and the western edge of the adjacent villages\nup to the Vistula bend northeast of Kosienice. Here, aviators had\nidentified a bridge built over the Vistula from Pavlonwize. The enemy front\nnow had a width of more than 10 km. There was no longer any doubt that\nquite strong Russian forces had crossed the river; barely detectable and hard-to-capture batteries\nsupported them from the east bank.\nGeneral v. Gallwitz rightly considered the situation serious. A midday\nincoming, completely surprising aviator report that the enemy was again\ncrossing northwest of Nowo-Alexandria with strong forces may have reinforced\nthe unfavorable perception, and an early inquiry prompted by this report\nfrom the army high command regarding earlier events at Iwangorod\nmay have had a disconcerting effect. The commanding general wanted to leave nothing\nuntried and decided, as had meanwhile also been suggested by the high command itself,\nto carry out the attack now at night. If the own troops\ndid not advance, then at least the enemy should be kept in check\nand deterred from further actions. Whether orders would be delivered in time\nwas questionable; the signal \"Quickly forward\" was supposed to\nrestart the attack movement around midnight. It\ndissipated in the wind and rain of the pitch-dark night. The exhausted,\npartly half-submerged, almost frozen from wetness and cold\ntroops found it impossible to continue the attack; they were literally\nstuck in the mud. General v.

H\u00fclsen (43rd Infantry Brigade) arrived, stating that his brigade had pushed the enemy back and was positioned with the left flank on the Vistula. He had the impression that the Russian resistance was now only to be considered minor. General v. Gallwitz was immediately determined to resume the attack, and at 7 a.m. he gave the order for the 3rd Guard Infantry Division and the 43rd Infantry Brigade. This brigade was to advance against the bridgehead and roll up the enemy along the Vistula embankment from the northwest. But soon after, Major General v. H\u00fclsen himself appeared to retract his confident report based on new impressions. General v. Gallwitz was compelled to report to the Army High Command at 9 a.m.: \"Yesterday afternoon, last night, and this morning I ordered the attack against enemy positions; it has in no case progressed beyond the initial stage. My subordinates explain that it is not the will of the leaders or the morale of the troops that oppose the execution, but merely the physical impossibility of conducting the attack in the marshy ground and over the swollen streams as necessary against the excellently arranged and well-occupied position of the enemy. The infantry cannot run, only creep; the artillery has already partly stalled, and it has no positions from which the enemy's heavy artillery standing across the Vistula can be effectively combated. I intended to roll up the enemy position from the narrow Vistula side. The general standing there, v. H\u00fclsen, also declares this not feasible, because the troops in their current state, even if they were to become masters of the Vistula entrenchments on this side, would become a victim of the enemy line on the other side and the heavy artillery standing there. I am not lacking in troops, the number is sufficient, but even the position of the Andreykorps can no longer bring any change. I urgently request orders on whether I should order the attack at all costs, for which none of the generals is in a position to vouch for success, or whether I should remain in the position I have chosen or march off for other use, leaving covering troops. \u2014 The troops are on their fourth day of operations today and have received only makeshift or no supplies at all in these days.\"\n</body>\n", "152": "\n<pageno>527</pageno>\n<header>8th Army \u2014 Change in Command.</header>\n<body>\nup to now made 3000 prisoners, captured 18 guns, including a \nheavy battery.

General \nv. Fran\u00e7ois appeared as the victor of Ratschki, whose success the High \nCommand failed to exploit. The following inquiry was therefore sent to \nGeneral v. Schubert: \"Immediate short wire report on how it is intended to \ncontinue the operation in general by exploiting the beautiful success of Ratschki.\"\nThe response from General v. Schubert, which arrived at the Supreme Army Command \non October 4 at 4 a.m., read: \"Success of \nRatschki, 3500 prisoners, 20 guns without barrels, 4 heavy \ncannons, could not be exploited by further pursuit, as strong \nenemy forces are deployed against the northern army wing \u2014 \nconcentration of 3\u00bd divisions of the 8th Army in prepared position at W\u00fcr- \nballen; southern army wing today withdrawn to line Oletzko (8) \u2014 Baka\u0142arschewo \u2014 \nPischczol.

Fran\u00e7ois. At 10 a.m., \nan order from the Supreme War Lord was issued, summoning General \nv. Schubert for consultation to Charleville and further decreed: \n\"General v. Fran\u00e7ois will take command of the 8th Army during the absence of General \nv. Schubert.\" This order was supplemented \nby the immediate instruction from Lieutenant General v.

This resulted in a defensive front approximately 25 km long for this corps, currently reinforced by two infantry brigades (43rd and 72nd), from south of Ivangorod to north of Kosienice. The enemy was positioned in the fortified foreland of Ivangorod in numerous villages and opposite the Vistula dam. Reinforcements could continuously flow to him over two bridges in Ivangorod (one of which was a railway bridge) and one at Pawlowice.\nAt the army headquarters, the already mentioned air reconnaissance report from midday on October 12th\u00b9), that the enemy was again crossing south of Ivangorod, near Nowo-Alexandria, had prudently aroused very serious concerns and triggered a series of measures that disrupted the course of operations. From the north, the XX Army Corps had been set in motion to provide assistance, and from the south, the 44th Infantry Brigade of the XI Army Corps was also quickly mobilized, although the corps was at that time under the Austrian-Hungarian 1st Army. In the area of the allied army command, the temporarily severe disturbance of leadership was expressed. Only in the afternoon did reports from the Landwehr Corps clarify that the pilot had mistaken the location \u2014 he had observed the crossing at Pawlowice. Captain v.

The enemy, presumably in front of the 6th and 15th Cavalry Divisions, held back cautiously.\nEast of the lakes, Lyck was occupied by a detachment of the L\u00f6tzen fortress. Southeast of Marggrabowa, General v. Morgen stood with the 3rd and 36th Reserve Divisions; the latter was already partially in transport to Wirballen. Behind them lay the Landwehr Division (33rd, 34th, and 70th Landwehr Brigade). In a wide arc east and north around Filipowo stood the I Army Corps with security in almost 30 km extension from Bakalarzewo to P\u00f6tschersl south of the Rominten Heath; behind it, the 6th Landwehr Brigade was advancing. To the north, up to the Wischtyter Lake, the 1st Cavalry Division joined, whose 1st Brigade\u00b9) was moving back to the division. The enemy, assumed to be the VI Corps and 4th Cavalry Division, was supposed to have crossed the border from Schtschutschin and Grajewo, from Suwalki he was advancing in a broad front towards the west. In general, three to four corps were expected here; on and north of the road leading from Filipowo to the east, they were already attacking, about 10 km ahead of the 1st Cavalry Division.\nNorth of the Rominten Heath, General Otto v. Below stood with his 1st Reserve Division and the K\u00f6nigsberg Landwehr Division in a 19 km long defensive position at Wirballen; as reinforcement, the 36th Reserve Division came from the south, the 9th Landwehr Brigade from the north. The enemy, estimated here at four corps, cautiously advanced against the German positions.\n</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) See p. 509.</footer>\n", "005": "\n<header>Table of Contents.\nThe Autumn Campaign 1914.\nIn the West until the Position Warfare.\nIn the East until the Retreat.</header>\n<body>\nI.

However, it was only ready to march on the morning of October 14 at Rosienitze after being relieved.\nMeanwhile, the battles with the Mackensen Army Group continued on October 12 and 13.\nThe detachment sent by the XX Army Corps to the Pilitza estuary had determined that no crossing was taking place there. At Gora-Kalwaria, the enemy did not wait for the German attack to be carried out, but instead evacuated the western bank of the Vistula during the night of October 12 and broke the bridge. They left 400 prisoners behind. Thus, General v. Scholtz was able to immediately direct his 37th Infantry Division north to support the XVII Army Corps at Piaseczno. However, this movement was not executed, as the army corps \u2014 with the exception of the transferred 73rd Infantry Brigade, which was to join the XVII Army Corps \u2014 was recalled south by the army command due to a reported new Russian crossing at Nowo-Alexandria. When it was later revealed that there had been an error in aerial observation at Nowo-Alexandria and additionally General v. Gallwitz reported on the morning of October 13 that no success could be achieved at Rosienitze even with reinforcements, the XX Army Corps was initially assigned the protection of the Vistula line Ryczywol \u2014 Gora-Kalwaria.\nIn front of Warsaw, the 35th Infantry Division had taken Piaseczno on the morning of October 12; also on the rest of the front of the Mackensen Group, the troops of the XVII Army Corps and the Frommel Corps had advanced a few kilometers, then began to build positions. On their left flank, the 8th Cavalry Division also only reached about 10 km southwest of Blonie on this day. The marching-weary troops of the General Command v. Brodr\u00fcck (21st Landwehr Brigade and Landsturm Brigade Hoffmann) were located at Chierniezewo and Lowitsch.\nAt the army command, doubts arose as to whether it would be possible to hold close to Warsaw without the XX Army Corps, which had turned south; there was particular concern about the extreme left flank. By October 12, at least 2\u00bd enemy corps had been identified south of Warsaw, the I, as well as \u00bd I and II Siberian Corps. On October 13, Colonel v. Sauvezweig was sent to General v.

Army Corps will push back the enemy standing before it to Sumalki tomorrow with Hellswerden. 3rd Reserve Division accompanies the attack via Ratschki. 1st Cavalry Division remains Sittlthemen. I. Reserve Corps holds its positions.\" The 33rd Landwehr Brigade was assigned to General v. Morgen, the I. Army Corps the Landwehr Division (now 34th and 70th Brigade) and the 6th Landwehr Brigade.\nOn the southern flank of the army, a series of bitter battles ensued in the following days. Lieutenant General v. Morgen encountered his previous opponent, the III. Siberian Corps, and reached the woods west of Ratschki on October 5. The I. Army Corps, now under the command of Lieutenant General v. Falt, initially allowed the enemy, the II. Caucasian Corps, to advance and then repelled them in a counterattack. The Russians suffered heavy bloody losses. On the German side, however, these successes strengthened the hope that it might be possible to push the enemy further east over Gswalti on October 6. Then General v. Fran\u00e7ois wanted to swing north from there on October 7 against the enemy, who in the meantime attacked the Below Corps<sup>1</sup>. However, on October 6, the German southern flank had little room left; their own ammunition was difficult. The Russian attacks against the Below Corps continued, but in the south, strong Russian cavalry, at least three divisions, were reported on the right flank of General v. Morgen; from Grajewo, the enemy advanced further. Thus, General v. Fran\u00e7ois could not carry out his attack intentions either, but had to decide on defense; he wanted to conduct them as long as possible at the border itself. \"Only if pressed\"<sup>2</sup> \u2014 as stated in the army order of the evening of October 6 \u2014, should they retreat to the L\u00fctzen\u2014Angerapp position: General v.

Mackensen was already in the process of shifting more combat-effective troops to the left flank in response to the changed situation. Despite reports of enemy reinforcements arriving by rail before Warsaw, he viewed the situation confidently and was concerned that retreating would lower morale among his own ranks and increase enemy confidence in victory. He also considered the current position of his troops tactically more favorable than further back. He decided to hold his ground and extend his left flank by bringing in the troops of the General Command v. Brodrhem behind Utrata and Bzura up to the Vistula. There, on the orders of the High Command, the border guard troops of the Deputy General Command of the II Army Corps and the Thorn Fortress were to join the Landsturm Brigade Rintelen at Gombin and the Landsturm Brigade Westernhagen at Wlozlawek.

Since he had to reckon with a German advance from Silesia against the middle Vistula, his next goal was to decisively strike the forces expected here. If successful, the way to Germany was open; East Prussia and all major German eastern fortresses could be bypassed in the south. Thus, gradually, from the situation and the exchange of views with the army groups of the northwest and southwest fronts, the plan developed to weaken East Prussia and Galicia and concentrate all available forces behind the middle Vistula for a major strike against the German army in Poland. The already mentioned meeting on September 26 in Cholm\u00b2) led to the first directives of the Supreme Command in this direction. The main task of the southwest front was to prepare the attack from the middle Vistula against the upper Oder for an incursion into Germany. To cover the northern flank of this attack, the northwest front army group was already preparing to resume the offensive against the Masurian Lakes.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Connection to p. 433f. \u2014 \u00b2) p. 433. \u2014 Korolklow, Overview, p. 24 and 31, and Warsaw-Ivangorod, p. 17f.</footer>\n", "155": "\n<pageno>530</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>On October 7, the I. Turkestan Corps and simultaneously Bialla were lost to Russian cavalry. The positions of General v. Morgen were threatened from the rear. However, the German southern flank was withdrawn to Marggrabowa on October 8. (As far as was known), five Russian corps were now fighting: I. Turkestan, III. Siberian, XXII., II. Caucasian Corps, and XXVI. (Reserve) Corps against the troops of General v. Morgen and the I. Army Corps. The I. Reserve Corps faced at least two more Russian corps, XX. and III. Corps. The Russian II. and IV. Corps were also assumed to be in front of the East Prussian eastern front, although their exact location was not known. General v. Fran\u00e7ois saw no danger despite this overwhelming enemy superiority, as long as the Russians limited themselves to local attacks; however, in the long run, the extended border position could hardly be held with the available weak forces. Therefore, on October 8, he addressed the Supreme Army Command and Generaloberst v. Hindenburg with the inquiry whether \"reinforcements, especially artillery, could be expected soon.\" Meanwhile, he had about seven replacement battalions, three light and two heavy batteries freed in Graudenz and K\u00f6nigsberg and mainly assigned to the southern flank under General v.

It was added that the 8th Army should spread the belief by arranging unloading points and through agents that six new army corps were destined for East Prussia. Such deception maneuvers could also temporarily ease the situation in East Prussia. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg, whose 9th Army had reached the Vistula near and above Iwangorod at that time, announced that he would attack towards Warsaw on October 10, much further north than the 8th Army had previously known.

Fundamental Decisions for the Overall War Conduct.</header>\n<body>On the evening of September 14, Lieutenant General v. Falkenhayn, in addition to his previous position as Minister of War, took over the duties of the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army. Although Colonel General v. Moltke remained, albeit only in form, at the request of the Supreme War Lord initially in his previous position at the Great Headquarters\u00b9), the responsibility for the future conduct of operations was transferred solely to the newly appointed Quartermaster General v. Falkenhayn. The new assignment did not come as a surprise to him, as already on August 10, before the departure of the Great Headquarters to the field, the Chief of the Military Cabinet, General of Infantry Baron v. Lyncker, had asked him whether he would be willing to take over the leadership of the Field Army in the event of the possible failure of Colonel General v. Moltke\u00b2). During the following fateful weeks, General v. Falkenhayn was only informed about the situation of the German armies and the enemy's news as far as his duties as Minister of War required\u00b3), so he was completely unprepared for the new task. Only in the very last days, from September 12 onwards, does he seem to have been involved in the briefings of the Chief of the General Staff with the Supreme War Lord and to have gained more detailed knowledge of the operations. He had been critical of the previous German war conduct; the relentless forward thrusts, especially the advance past Paris behind an enemy who, in his conviction, was by no means crushed or retreating in flight, he considered a mistake. He expressed this view also in a discussion with Colonel General v. Moltke on the evening of September 14.\nIndeed, it was a difficult operational situation that he inherited from his predecessor.

Below had just recaptured the border towns of Schirwindt and Wladislawow on October 9 and taken numerous prisoners. General v. Fran\u00e7ois decided to deploy the new corps on the southern flank.\nThe following days showed that the enemy might have withdrawn forces from the East Prussian front. The Russian II Corps was no longer expected on October 12; whether the IV was still there was questionable; at Lyk and Marggrabowa, there were signs of retreating movements. In the north, all Russian attacks were repelled, with 3,500 prisoners and about 30 guns reported as booty. General v. Fran\u00e7ois was determined to attack the Russian southern flank. \"With the arrival of reinforcements\" \u2014 he announced his further intentions on October 13 \u2014 the army will move from defense to attack. XXV Reserve Corps will take possession of Lyk with the first unloaded troops...\" Under their protection, the unloadings should be advanced, and the corps should be pushed forward to the border so that it can attack Augustow immediately upon the arrival of the sixth parts. The corps Morgen was to prepare for this, simultaneously attacking Suwalki from the west with the reinforced I Army Corps. Corps Below was to remain in defense for the time being.\nThe XXV Reserve Corps under General of Infantry Freiherr v. Scheffer-Boyadel was composed similarly to the new corps intended for the west. It consisted mainly of young war volunteers, who were full of good will but often not yet physically mature and only hastily trained. The number of officers and non-commissioned officers was very low, and those with war experience were almost entirely lacking. The corps had two divisions, each with 3 battalions, 1 squadron, 10 batteries (including 1 heavy). It had to lag behind the corps intended for the west in terms of equipment, but was only provisionally equipped when the transport to the front began; machine guns, field artillery, and machine gun tent equipment were not yet complete.\nThe first unloadings of the XXV Reserve Corps were covered by troops from the fortress of L\u00f6tzen, who managed to take possession of Lyk on October 13. Unloaded parts of the 49th Reserve Division advanced</body>\n", "083": "\n<pageno>458</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>increase; their 2nd Army was to advance in conjunction with the armies of the Southwest Front from Warsaw, to form an \"attack group of ten to twelve corps\" on the left bank of the Vistula with the aim \"Posen\u2014Breslau\").\nOn September 30, it was learned from the diary of a fallen German officer that of the six corps that had fought at the Masurian Lakes, only two remained in East Prussia, along with some individual divisions and Landwehr brigades. The Russian Supreme Command further estimated a German troop strength of at most four corps in East Prussia, opposed by ten Russian (10th Army), \u2014 furthermore, insignificant German forces at Mlawa and Thorn, opposed by more than two Russian corps from the 2nd Army and the Warsaw detachment \u2014, and significant enemy forces gathered in the Lodz\u2014Kielzy area, near Krakow and behind the Carpathians. The group at Lodz\u2014Kielzy was described as \"the most dangerous.\" To defeat them, the Russian 4th, 5th, and 9th Armies were to attack their front from the middle Vistula, with the 2nd Army, reinforced by two to three corps, striking them in the flank from Warsaw. All forces involved in the attack and the Vistula fortresses up to and including Nowogeorgiewsk were placed under the command of General Iwanow.\nGeneral Iwanow wanted to wait with the attack until all forces were assembled. He moved his 4th and 9th Armies northwards on the right bank of the Vistula, while assembling the 5th behind them at Lublin, to then advance them by rail into the area between the 2nd and 4th Armies, between Warsaw and Iwangorod. While permanent fortifications on the left bank of the Vistula and advanced defensive positions beyond it secured the advance for the 2nd Army at Warsaw and to a limited extent also for the 4th Army at Iwangorod, such bridgeheads were lacking on the rest of the front. On October 8, General Iwanow had the following, rather false picture of the enemy: 1) At</body>\n<footer>1) Letter from the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Januschkewitsch, to the Minister of War dated September 28, 1914 (Krahn Archive I, G. 251).\n2) Danilow, p. 299.\n3) Korolkov, Liberbild, p. 28, and Warsaw-Iwangorod, p. 36. \u2014 For consistency, only entire corps are counted in this section and further on, without considering individual independent divisions and brigades.

However, Russian counterattacks on the night of October 14 and on that day itself led to fierce fighting and temporary panic in the streets of the city, until the enemy was finally defeated by the approaching bulk of the division. Calm was restored. On the morning of October 17, the reserve corps was ready to march, with the 49th Reserve Division at Lyck, with the 50th behind on the L\u00f6tzen road.\nMeanwhile, aircraft had reported the march of enemy columns from Ratschki southwards, towards Grajewo. Here, besides the I. Turkestan Corps, the 11th Siberian Rifle Division and the 4th Independent Cavalry Brigade were identified, while the enemy seemed to have weakened at the front from Marggrabowa. General v. Fran\u00e7ois anticipated deployments at Grajewo. Therefore, despite the still unfavorable ammunition situation, he adhered to the attack plan. The XXV Reserve Corps was to advance on October 17 from Lyck to Grajewo, while the Morgen Corps (3rd Reserve Division and Ziemen Division, newly formed from the 33rd Landwehr Brigade and fortress troops from Graudenz) was to advance spatially far apart from Marggrabowa to Ratschki.\nOn October 18, the XXV Reserve Corps reached Grajewo after overcoming weak resistance. A last departing train there could still be taken under artillery fire; the enemy had retreated to Ossowiec. \u2014 The situation was different for the Morgen Corps: its attack encountered sustained resistance from the III. Siberian Corps in the difficult terrain southeast of Marggrabowa, which in turn repeatedly counterattacked. Strong enemy forces were also reported further south near Kallinowen.\nFor the continuation of the attack, General v. Fran\u00e7ois had already ordered the XXV Reserve Corps on the morning of October 18: \"After capturing Grajewo, the task of the Scheffer Corps is to advance against the left flank of the enemy facing the Morgen Corps. The Russian left flank is to be grasped in the general direction of Augustowo. Grajewo is to be held fortified.\" The condition of the young troops of the reserve corps, whose effectiveness was already greatly diminished by extraordinary marching losses, did not allow them to immediately take on the new task; a rest was necessary.</body>\n<footer>1) The I.

While, according to significant Russian perception, the Austro-Hungarian forces at Sandomir and on the San were particularly active, further north the German corps seemed to hold back more. General Iwanow believed he had time to establish a broad front on the western bank of the Vistula opposite them; for this, he ordered the crossing of the river by the forces ready until then for October 10. He does not seem to have anticipated serious combat.\nFollowing the advance troops of the 2nd Army south of Warsaw (II Siberian Corps at Siernewize, Mschtschonow, and Grojec), the XXIII1) and II2) Corps, both temporarily assigned to the 5th Army, were to cross the river at Gora-Kalwaria as its vanguard and reach the Grojec\u2014Warta line by October 11. The 4th Army was to cross in the Kosienice\u2014Iwangorod section and, if possible, gain the Jedlinsf\u2014Gwolne\u2014Ilfanka mouth line by October 12, thus taking the entire Vistula bend west of Iwangorod and Nowo-Alexandria as a bridgehead. For this, the III Caucasian Corps was to advance over Iwangorod, the Grenadier Corps over Nowo-Alexandria, and the XVI Corps over Kazimierz.\nWhen on October 9 the Ural Cossack Division, scouting in front of the line, reported the German advance and German artillery took the Russian defensive lines west of Iwangorod under fire in the evening, a brigade of the Caucasian Corps was set to cross further north, over Pawlowice to Kosienice. On the night of October 10, three new Vistula bridges were to be built, but only the one at Nowo-Alexandria was completed by dawn, the one at Kazimierz only by 11 a.m., and the one at Kosienice apparently much later3). Thus, the Grenadier Corps advanced first to the west, and as the XVI Corps was still behind, its southern flank remained uncovered. The grenadiers therefore retreated in the afternoon before the attack of the German 3rd Landwehr and 3rd Guard Infantry Division to the bridge site.

The idea of temporarily foregoing the campaign decision on the western front by transitioning to a defensive posture in a suitable defensive position and instead seeking the decision in the East was rejected outright by the new head of operations, although he did not fail to recognize that the tension of the situation in the East was significantly heightened not only by the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian army in Galicia and the unsatisfactory course of previous operations on the Serbian theater of war, but above all by Japan's declaration of war on Germany on August 23, which allowed Russia to bring even the last man from Siberia against the Central Powers. An immediate regrouping of stronger forces from the West to the East, according to General v. Falkenhayn, would lead to \"intolerable conditions\" in the West as long as the situation here was not completely stabilized. This goal seemed to him only secured after the defeat of the Anglo-French forces. He therefore believed that the current campaign plan to bring about the final decision in the West required only an early resumption of the offensive. It also seemed to him \"possible, if the current German front holds, to bring the northern French coast and thus control over the English Channel into German hands.\" Nevertheless, he was already clear that a final decision in the West was not to be expected for weeks. The question of whether the Eastern Front could hold out alone against the ever-increasing Russian masses and provide the necessary rear protection for the Western army was serious.

From Ivangorod, however, where a solid bridgehead with two bridges and about 3 1/2 divisions (1 1/2 from the III Caucasian Corps, 75th and 81st Reserve Divisions, Ural Cossack Division) could have been available, the attack against the German 1st Guard Reserve Infantry Brigade standing sideways on the other bank was not attempted at all. From the German XVI Corps, a brigade moved under the protection of the fortifications on the left bank of the Vistula along the river to the west, another began the crossing at Pawlowice; General commanded the rest of his troops there. By evening, troops of the 21st Infantry Division, at least of brigade strength, but essentially only infantry, could establish themselves in a bridgehead-like position on the left bank of the river and initially set up undisturbed.\nThe misfortune of the Grenadier Corps prompted the commander-in-chief of the 4th Army, General Ewert, to relinquish the success of the XVI Corps in the afternoon. He ordered both corps to retreat to the right bank of the Vistula and to dismantle the bridges. Thus, on the morning of October 11, the Russians had only a foothold on the left bank of the river at Kosienice, apart from the bridgehead of Ivangorod itself. However, General Ewert also ordered the retreat and dismantling of the bridge for these parts in the evening. But the commanding general of the Caucasian Corps, who had no enemy in front of him there, nevertheless left his troops on the west bank of the river. When they were attacked during the day, half of the 21st Infantry Division held out, albeit with heavy losses.\nThe sudden and completely unexpected German attack on Warsaw had brought further serious concerns. The commander-in-chief of the 2nd Army, General Scheidemann, had 2 1/2 corps (I, 1/2 I Siberian and II Siberian) available south of Warsaw on October 11, with more troops stationed in Warsaw (XXVII Corps) or arriving; above all, he counted on the cooperation of the XXIII and II Corps from Gora-Kalwaria. But by the evening of the day, the right wing of the army at Brwinow was in disarray under heavy losses, while support from Gora-Kalwaria failed to materialize, General Scheidemann did not want to engage in further combat against the supposed German superiority. \"In terrible hours, the Siberian corps held back the Germans!\"\n</body>\n", "158": "\n<pageno>533</pageno>\n<header>The Battles of the XXV Reserve Corps.</header>\n<body>day should be set.

In the distance of the Reserve Corps, the enemy stood at the narrow pass south of Gr. Selmentsee. General v.

Hungry, emaciated troops streamed into the city day and night \u2014 all deserters, many without weapons.\"\nAt Gora-Kalwaria, where two corps of the 5th Army were supposed to cross the river, initially only one brigade of the Russian XXIII Corps reached the western Vistula bank, as the construction of the bridge dragged on until noon on October 11. By the evening of the day, however, the entire corps had reached the west bank, and the beginning of the II Corps had just begun to cross \u2014 when a counter-order from the army group caused them to evacuate this bank again from midnight.\nAlthough the 2nd Army at Warsaw, including the fortress garrison, could have assembled at least four corps by October 12, the Supreme Army Command and the Commander-in-Chief of the Southwestern Front were nevertheless seriously concerned about this important place and the execution of the intended attack from there against the German flank. General Ivanov had therefore recalled the II and XXIII Corps of the 5th Army at Gora-Kalwaria to the right Vistula bank, to now set them marching behind the river towards Warsaw. To relieve the 2nd Army, he ordered the 4th Army to continue attacking at Kosienice. On October 12, besides the entire III Caucasian Corps, the foremost brigade of the XVII Corps of the 5th Army, which had just arrived by rail, was deployed, while the 75th and 81st Reserve Divisions were still held back on the right Vistula bank and in Iwangorod. On October 13, the rest of the XVII Corps also entered the battle; at Kosienice and Iwangorod, there were a total of 6\u00bd Russian divisions available against only three German ones. Nevertheless, the Russians barely managed to hold on.

His army command \u2014 still unaware of the turn of events in the West \u2014 considered the time had come to transfer strong German forces from the French to the Russian front. However, this was not to be considered for the time being. The West had to help itself first despite everything. The new victory in East Prussia at the Masurian Lakes seemed to offer the possibility to provide additional forces to the allied army beyond the Landwehr Corps already deployed there. Thus, Colonel General v. Moltke had already promised two German army corps on September 13th in response to urgent calls for help, which could be temporarily spared in East Prussia. When Colonel General v. Hindenburg reported on the evening of September 14th that the 8th Army in East Prussia had succeeded in decisively defeating the enemy, they could manage there with even fewer forces than previously assumed and thus provide more help to their allies. The allied army command pressed ever more urgently; the supreme commander Archduke Friedrich wanted to strike again only when strong Imperial German forces could join the fight directly shoulder to shoulder with the Austro-Hungarian forces. Based on a very serious report from the authorized German general at Austro-Hungarian headquarters, Lieutenant General Baron v. Freytag-Loringhoven, General v. Falkenhayn ordered immediate support for the allies on September 15th through a new 9th Army consisting of four army corps and one cavalry division\u00b9). The director of German operations calculated that these forces would be sufficient to give the allied army not only stability but also impetus to resume the offensive. He hoped that the Eastern Front would now be able to withstand the Russian onslaught through its own strength until the enemy in the West was defeated.\nHere, since the Battle of the Marne, they were still dependent on French leadership; General v. Falkenhayn saw wresting back the initiative from them as his primary task. The original view, mainly represented by Lieutenant Colonel Hentsch, that through the deployment of the newly formed 7th Army marching from Belgium on the right wing of the army, they would soon succeed in resuming the offensive (which had only been temporarily suspended for the purpose of joining the 1st and 2nd Armies) and thereby bringing about the decision in the West that had only been postponed for a few days\u00b2), had all too soon proved deceptive.

The 49th Reserve Division initially repelled the enemy but had to bend its northern flank the following day due to new attacks by the Siberians, to connect with the Morgen Corps, which, despite all efforts, had only advanced a few kilometers northward. Further north, there was calm in front of the positions of the I Army Corps. At Wirballen, there was no danger at the time, and in the south, the enemy had only cautiously followed to Lyk.\nAccording to estimates by the pilots, about two Russian corps were in the area of August\u00f3w-Suwalki and eastward on October 23. North of that, only weak enemy forces were detected in front of the 1st Cavalry Division. Reports of the approach of twenty trains at August\u00f3w reinforced the army leader's belief that the enemy was withdrawing troops. Therefore, he decided, despite the continued shortage of ammunition, visibly reduced offensive power, especially of the XXV Reserve Corps, and the limited success of previous battles, to resume the attack in the direction of August\u00f3w-Suwalki. Even the pilot report that strong enemy cavalry was advancing from the southwest and northeast on Grajewo did not shake this decision.\nTo secure the right flank, General v. Scheffer had to reinforce the garrison at Lyk; additionally, the 41st Cavalry Brigade was transported there from the 1st Cavalry Division. As further parts of the XXV Reserve Corps had to block the narrow area southeast of the Gr. Selment Lake \u2014 now facing south \u2014 only a few battalions and batteries from the 50th Reserve Division remained available behind the 49th Reserve Division at Pissanitzen.\nThe attack was to begin on October 24 and be led with a shock group formed from the left wing of the XXV Reserve Corps and the right of the Morgen Corps (fortress troops from Graudenz) towards Ratschki. This main thrust was to be supported by the right wing of the I Army Corps, advancing from Filipowo east of the lakes also towards Ratschki. The attack was under an unfavorable star. The shock group consisted of troops of the lowest combat value. Their attack fell apart in time, as newly deployed parts of the 50th Reserve Division arrived partially delayed. This resulted in the surprising loss of the attack direction into strong enemy artillery fire. The own artillery support failed, and the attack stalled. But even the I Army Corps got stuck, although its</body>\n", "015": "\n<pageno>4</pageno>\n<header>Fundamental Decisions for Overall War Conduct.</header>\n<body>Part of the 7th Army had just been used to close this gap; to defend against the increasingly evident French encirclement efforts directed at the right wing of the 1st Army, only weaker forces were initially available.\nIt was only in the early hours of September 15th, when the Chief of the Operations Department, Colonel Tappen, returned to the Great Headquarters from the right wing of the army, that reassuring news about the situation there was brought. A unified army front was reestablished, and a balance of forces seemed foreseeable. It was certainly expected that the danger still existing for the right wing of the 1st Army would soon be averted by withdrawing individual army corps from the shortened army front and deploying them to the right wing.\nTo what extent the war mood, particularly the offensive spirit and combat strength of the troops, had suffered from the setback at the Marne, General v. Falkenhayn himself could not initially form a secure judgment. Based on impressions gathered by Colonel Tappen during his front visit, he leaned towards a favorable view of the offensive strength of his own troops, while it seemed to be lacking in the enemy.\nBy deploying the significant forces of the 6th Army, some of which were already in transit, on the right wing, General v. Falkenhayn intended to initiate a new decisive offensive. If this brought about the hoped-for change in the war situation in favor of the German forces, then the setback at the Marne had only delayed the decision on this battlefield by a few weeks, at most months.\nAlthough initially a significant extension of the war duration due to the setback at the Marne did not seem likely, the question arose in these days whether the available personnel and material resources would suffice for all further tasks, especially since the difficult defensive task of the Eastern Army against the ever-increasing Russian superiority could not be solved with ample supply of manpower replacements and ammunition. Even after a full success in the West, the great campaign in the East was still ahead, for which new reserves, new replacements, and new vast supplies of ammunition had to be secured.</body>\n<footer>1) Volume IV, p. 472 and 506. \u2014 2) Volume IV, p. 480. \u2014 3) Volume IV, p. 473. \u2014 4) Volume IV, p. 458 and 518.</footer>\n", "087": "\n<pageno>462</pageno>\n<header>The Campaign in the East until the End of October 1914.</header>\n<body>\ncorps had already ordered the retreat to the right bank of the Vistula by the evening of the day, when the army commander intervened and the movement halted again).\nThe concern about Warsaw had meanwhile been resolved, for on October 13, the Russians had been able to advance their positions far beyond the fort belt almost without a fight after reinforcements arrived, as the Germans had not followed. The German reconnaissance had missed the temporary complete withdrawal; the works of the fortress and the concern about long-range fire had contributed to this.\n3. The Intervention of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army.\na) Negotiations and Events from October 13 to 19.\nIncluding Maps 14, 15 and Sketch 9.\nThe question of how to continue the operations of the German 9th Army had become pressing since it was known that the Russians were preparing a major counterattack from Warsaw. The situation had become increasingly difficult by October 13: At Ivangorod and northwards, the enemy held the west bank of the Vistula in a front about 25 km wide. There was hardly any prospect of driving them back here for the time being. Two bridgeheads in the area of the fortress and one opposite Rotsizeine gave them the opportunity to quickly reinforce further. In Warsaw, the enemy's resistance and the number of their forces were growing rapidly; flyers reported troop movements on the eastern Vistula bank with foot march and rail in the direction of the city.\nMeanwhile, the difficulties for the crossing of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army over the San were also increasing. In view of the unfavorable water and road conditions, it seemed necessary to limit the crossing to the right wing corps of the army. But the 1st Army, advancing further upstream, had not yet crossed the river. General v. Conrad hoped for the effectiveness of the 3rd Army, which was fighting further south. Regarding the distribution of forces, by October 11, the picture had emerged that \u2014 not counting the Austro-Hungarian Landsturm Brigades \u2014 35 Austro-Hungarian divisions faced 26 Russian divisions on the right of the Vistula, while on the left of the river, against also 26 Russian divisions, there were only 16\u00bd divisions of the\n</body>\n", "160": "\n<pageno>535</pageno>\n<header>8th Army \u2014 The Attack Stalls.</header>\n<body>The commanding general, Lieutenant General Kosch, had moved his 1st Infantry Division behind the 2nd to the right flank to reinforce the thrust and let them attack unexpectedly through the Landwehr stationed there. In the first rush, several Russian positions east of Baka\u0142arzewo were taken; however, to continue the attack, it would have required new aggressive artillery preparation. However, the ammunition was lacking. The brave troops of the 1st Army Corps had left 3,470 men dead and wounded. \u2014 The enemy had almost everywhere engaged the best troops in battle. On November 5th, he felt convinced that he was even attacking the XXV Reserve Corps, albeit without success.\nAccording to the orders of General v. Fran\u00e7ois, attempts were made in the following days to continue the German attack; however, progress was hardly achieved. On the other hand, the pressure from the enemy from the south became increasingly noticeable. He constantly tied up considerable forces at \u0141o\u0107 and fiercely threatened the city and the road \u0141o\u0107\u2014Pi\u0105tnica. East of the XXV Reserve Corps, under enemy fire from the south, General v. Fran\u00e7ois was forced on October 8th to assign this corps, whose offensive power was already exhausted, \"the protection of the right army flank\" as its main task; thus, it was excluded from the attack to the east. The army leader therefore brought the 36th Reserve Division I Reserve Corps from the northern flank of the army to the 1st Army Corps and wanted to continue the attack with this corps and the corps the next morning. However, in the following days, progress was also slow here, moving from trench to trench. Thus, the attack brought some territorial gains in places, as well as several thousand prisoners; breaking the Russian resistance, however, did not succeed. On the other hand, the combat strength of the heavily exhausted own troops decreased more and more, and the overall situation changed.\nGradually, it had become apparent that the Russian VI and the I Turkestan Corps had been moved from the Grajewo area to the lower Narew, where a new Russian army was set up to break through the exposed East Prussian southern border. The request of the Braudenz government for the return of its troops could therefore not be refused.

By August 11, well over a million young Germans, men, and even old men, regardless of social class, had voluntarily rushed to the flags. Since no preparations had been made in peacetime for the clothing and equipping of additional units, only a relatively small number could be enlisted. \"To make this enormous, still available national strength usable for national defense,\" General v. Falkenhayn, as Minister of War, had already ordered the formation of five Prussian reserve corps on August 16. Bavaria, Saxony, and W\u00fcrttemberg each formed a reserve division. The Prussian reserve corps received the numbers XXII to XXVI, the reserve corps formed from the Saxon-Wuerttemberg divisions received the number XXVII, and the Bavarian reserve division received the number 6. The military organization of the corps included 26 battalions, 2 squadrons, 18 field batteries with 4 guns each. By October 10, 1914, the new units were to be ready for mobile use. General v. Falkenhayn did not deny that \"the implementation of the measure could only be accomplished with the exertion of all forces,\" but was convinced \"that the zeal and dedication of all leaders, as well as the proven patriotism and enthusiasm of our people, would make the work succeed for the benefit of the fatherland.\" Generaloberst v. Moltke had gladly welcomed the creation of the new reserve army, which was solely due to the personal initiative of General v. Falkenhayn. When he took over the leadership of operations in mid-September, he expected to be able to rely on the new army reserve after about a month. However, the fulfillment of this hope was to be questioned just a few days later by a letter from the Deputy Minister of War, Lieutenant General v. Wandel; it stated: \"Your Excellency, I urgently ask you to definitely oppose the desire for an early use of the reserve corps. Every day granted to them for training and consolidation is of utmost importance.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) For more details, see \"Military Armament and War Economy\" Volume I; to be published shortly.\n2) Order of the Prussian Ministry of War from August 16, 1914 M.

Below had repelled the enemy north of the Rominten Heath. Since the morning of October 2, his troops, initially only the I Reserve Corps (without the 36th Reserve Division) and, to the north of this, the K\u00f6nigsberg Landwehr Division, were positioned on Russian soil in a line about 20 km wide east of Wirballen. General v. Below had refrained from further extending the position to the south or north, as his forces were insufficient. Cavalry covered the 15 km wide area between Lake Wischtyter and the southern wing of the corps, about 8 km north of the left wing was the border town of Wladislawow, weakly occupied. The 36th Reserve Division was advancing from the south, from the north the 9th Landwehr Brigade, previously used at Tilsit, was to advance. From intercepted radio messages, it was known that the Russian XX and III Corps, the 5th Rifle Brigade, and the 56th Reserve Division were in front of the front.\nOn October 4, the enemy cautiously approached the German positions. General v. Below proposed a large-scale counterattack using reinforcements. The commander-in-chief, then still General v. Schubert, had the same intention. However, as already described, it was not carried out due to the change in command. General v. Below had to rely on his own forces. The enemy, however, pushed forward.\nOn October 5, Wladislawowo and Schirwindt were systematically handed over to the Russians. In front of the fortified position of Wirballen, the enemy generally held back, but in the south, they advanced east of Pillup\u00f6nen deep into the flank. Against this threatening encirclement, the arrival of the just-arriving 36th Reserve Division could be scheduled for October 6. Meanwhile, the situation also became more serious in the center and especially on the northern wing. Against the left wing of the 1st Reserve Division and against the K\u00f6nigsberg Division, the Russians came in repeated attacks to close distances, but were repelled, partly with heavy losses. In the north, the retreating 9th Landwehr Brigade was able to recapture the German border town of Schirwindt only after fighting.\nOn October 7, Schirwindt had to face a new Russian attack\n</body>\n", "234": "\n<pageno>609</pageno>\n<header>Troop Movements on the German Western Front.</header>\n<body>\na) Railway Lines\nb) March Routes\nUnloading Locations\nUnloading Time or Completion of Movement\nRemarks\nNesle\u2014Cartigny\nTrier\u2014Gerolstein\u2014Aachen\nLi\u00e8ge\u2014Namur\nCharleroi\u2014Mons\u2014Valenciennes\u2014Cambrai, from 24.9. via Namur\u2014Charleroi\u2014Maubeuge\u2014Busigny\nAurlu\nLuxembourg\u2014Libramont\u2014Marlorie\u2014Direction Namur\nSt. Quentin, Busigny, from 23.9.

Meanwhile, however, the encirclement threat on the southern flank was averted; General v. Below was able to move the bulk of the 36th Reserve Division as a reserve behind the northern flank and launched a counterattack here on the afternoon of October 8th, together with parts of the K\u00f6nigsberg Division. They succeeded in pushing the Russians back towards Wladislawow\u2014Schirwindt. Against these places, General v. Below ordered parts of the 36th Reserve Division and the K\u00f6nigsberg Division, as well as the 9th Landwehr Brigade, to launch a comprehensive attack from the south and west on October 9th. The enemy was thrown back, and the pursuit extended over Wladislawow about 4 km eastwards. More than a thousand prisoners from the Russian 56th Reserve Division and the 5th Rifle Brigade were captured. General v. Below did not intend to hold the newly taken line permanently; he withdrew the 36th Reserve Division as a reserve group to the south; the 9th Landwehr Brigade retreated again to the west to Willuhnen on the evening of October 10th in the face of renewed superior enemy advances.\nWhen the enemy advanced again over Schirwindt on October 11th, General v. Below immediately set his troops to counterattack, this time with the aim of encircling the enemy. West of the border, Lieutenant General Clausius advanced well with the 9th Landwehr Brigade; the 70th Reserve Brigade under Major General Bett also threw back the enemy southeast of Schirwindt. However, the decisive blow, which parts of the 69th Reserve Brigade were to deliver from the south east of the border into the enemy's rear, encountered stubborn resistance at the Scheimena section, which could only be broken the next day. Meanwhile, the northern flank at Schirwindt successfully repelled Russian counterattacks. The enemy had received a heavy blow, although the planned encirclement had not succeeded. The spoils of the previous battles counted 3500 prisoners and about 30 guns.\nThe offensive power of the Russians was broken on this part of the battlefront; calm ensued. However, due to pathless roads and wet, cold weather, the last days of fighting had also been extremely strenuous for the German troops. Further exploitation of the victory had to be abandoned. General v. Below considered the area around Schirwindt \u2014 as he reports\u00b9) \u2014 still \"as our maneuver field, where we do not transition to positional warfare, but remain in movement-</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) Letter to the Reich Archive from 1927.</footer>\n", "017": "\n<pageno>6</pageno>\n<header>Fundamental Decisions for Overall War Leadership.</header>\n<body>of significant importance.\" Despite this warning, General v. Falkenhayn adhered to his decision, considering the overall situation, to deploy the young corps to the front by mid-October at the latest.\nClosely related to the question of army reserves was the issue of replacements for the fighting army. The operational strengths of the armies in the West and East had decreased by 40 to 50 percent in some areas due to the weeks of ongoing battles and marches. It was urgently necessary to fill these gaps as quickly as possible. Although about 150,000 replacement troops had been sent from the homeland to the armies, they had not yet reached the armies by mid-September due to the sustained destruction of the railways in the occupied territories, but their arrival was expected imminently. Beyond these troop movements already sent to the front, the domestic replacement formations for the upcoming operations in the West and East still had significant stocks of trained troops, although mostly of older age groups, according to reports from the highest army commands. The recruitment depots currently had a stock of around 280,000 men.\nWhile there was no shortage of troop replacements to be feared for the time being, the replenishment of officers, especially active officers, caused difficulties. Death had taken a terrible toll among their ranks.\nFar more concerning than the replacement situation was the question of ammunition supply for the armies, which must have appeared to the Minister of War and the current head of operations, especially since he was aware that the existing mobilization stocks of artillery ammunition had largely been used up. For him as Minister of War, this serious difficulty was no surprise. In that conversation on the evening of September 14th1) with Generaloberst v. Moltke about the results of the operations so far, he emphasized that the shortage of artillery ammunition was particularly serious.\nThe anticipated wartime demand for ammunition for field and foot artillery was last determined in detailed consultations between the Ministry of War and the General Staff in 19122). However, the demands of the Great General Staff had to accept various reductions. But even the rates set at that time for the individual types of combat had not yet been reached at the outbreak of war.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 1. \u2014 2) For more details: \"War Armament and War Economy\" Volume I.</footer>\n", "018": "\n<pageno>7</pageno>\n<header>Supply and Ammunition Situation.</header>\n<body>...since the procurements, considering the high costs, had been spread over a larger number of years.\nThe existing mobilization stock of field and foot artillery ammunition was largely made available to the armies at the beginning of the war, loaded in ammunition trains. The rest of the stocks located at home were available to the Supreme Army Command as an additional ammunition reserve for call-off. The allocation of these and other quantities still available in fortresses, depots, etc., to the front was carried out by the Chief of Field Ammunition Services, Lieutenant General Siegen, to whom the army high commands had to direct their requests.\nThe unexpectedly strong and rapid consumption of ammunition in the first weeks of the war far exceeded peacetime calculations. After the border battles and the Battle of the Marne, the available stocks were almost exhausted. At that time, the domestic industry was not yet able to replace the ammunition consumption with the necessary speed and in sufficient quantity. The efforts initiated in the last two pre-war years, mainly again at the instigation of the General Staff, to increase the efficiency of the munitions industry began to take effect only gradually after the start of the war. To prevent a shortage of ammunition, the War Ministry made comprehensive preparations for increased ammunition production immediately after the outbreak of war. Apart from the management of war-critical raw materials initiated by the then head of the General Electric Company, Walter Rathenau, in the first days of August, several measures already prepared in peacetime were accelerated by the War Ministry; above all, the efficiency of state munitions factories was increased and private industry was involved in ammunition deliveries to a greater extent. Nevertheless, new deliveries could not be expected before mid-October, and even then only for field artillery. But this was only made possible by the fact that in 1913 a field artillery auxiliary shell \u2014 the gray cast iron grenade \u2014 which was easy and quick to manufacture, had been designed. For the heavy artillery, it was believed that the ample equipment of the fortresses provided a sufficient reserve on which the field army could fall back in an emergency. The early deployment of the heavy artillery from the fortresses to reinforce the field armies also dashed this hope.\nThus, by mid-September, the Supreme Army Command was already facing a disastrous shortage of artillery ammunition, which initially</body>\n", "088": "\n<pageno>463</pageno>\n<header>Interpretation of General v. Conrad.</header>\n<body>\nAllies1). On October 12, the 1st Army reported, \"that a San crossing due to the high water level and the very strong position of the Russians would end in failure\"2); under such circumstances, it was considered in Neu-Sandez to use another Austro-Hungarian corps on the left bank of the Vistula, so that only the X Corps of the 1st Army remained on the San. When on that day the already mentioned erroneous air report3) that the Russians were again in full transition at Nowo-Alexandria prompted the German High Command to request support, General v. Conrad immediately sent his northernmost, the 5th Infantry Division, northward and ordered the advance of three more divisions (V Corps of the 1st Army) to the left bank of the Vistula. However, he postponed the crossing of the 1st Army over the San until the intervention of the 3rd and 4th Armies; the latter was to begin the crossing 50 km above the mouth on October 13.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff laid down his overall view in a letter he wrote on October 12 to General v. Bolf- franz, the head of the military chancellery of his emperor4): \"Now a major Russian offensive from the Vistula in the stretch from the San mouth to Warsaw is likely to begin; hopefully, the Germans, reinforced by parts of our 1st Army, will hold out west of the Vistula long enough for our offensive east of the Vistula to show decisive success.\"\nThis view of General v. Conrad was entirely in line with that of the German High Command. The question of how to continue to solve the task on the middle Vistula pressed for a decision.\nThe hope for German reinforcements from the western theater of war had to be ruled out from the outset. The bulk of the newly formed reserve corps was just marching there to give the overall situation a decisive turn5). On the other hand, since October 11, the newly established XXV Reserve Corps wanted to advance to the 9th Army at Iwangorod, where command had been transferred to General v. Francois on October 4th6). On October 8, in view of the great Russian superiority, he had immediately inquired with Generaloberst v. Hindenburg and also with the Supreme Army Command whether he could count on reinforcements7).\n</body>\n", "233": "\n<pageno>608</pageno>\n<header>Troop Movements on the German Western Front</header>\n<body>\nSerial No. | Unit | from | to | Type of Troop Movement | Loading Time or Start of Movement | Loading Stations or Departure Locations\n11. | 7th R.

Falkenhayn, who no longer expected any major successes from the operation in Poland, had designated the only remaining available new reserve corps for East Prussia. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg had not been consulted on this measure, although the 8th Army was under his command; however, he had not raised any objections to the deployment of the XXV Reserve Corps in East Prussia, at that time still unaware of the Russian troop concentrations near Warsaw. He held the view that the extremely important East Prussian territory for the continuation of the war in the East must be held at all costs and considered a retreat to the at that time still incomplete lake line only permissible in the most extreme emergency. The defensive actions led offensively by General v. Francois seemed to tie down significant Russian forces and thus keep them away from the battles on the Vistula. Ultimately, however, the XXV Reserve Corps was the least combat-ready of all the new corps. Its commanding general, General of Infantry Freiherr v. Scheffer-Boyadel, reported on October 10 that the troops were still missing large parts of their equipment, weapons, and gear: \"Despite urgent desire to engage the enemy, reserve corps cannot be deemed operational.\" Such a troop could hardly be used effectively in a mobile war deep in enemy territory.\nIn the days following October 10, it became apparent that the Russians were indeed moving forces from the East Prussian front to Warsaw, and the situation on the Vistula was becoming increasingly tense. Thus, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg worked on October 13 with the 8th Army: \"It must be considered to move a division of the I Army Corps here upon the arrival of the XXV Reserve Corps from East Prussia.\" General v. Fran\u00e7ois, whose subordinate relationship to the general staff was not entirely clear after all that had happened, responded evasively: \"All forces are tied against approximately threefold superiority. Clearing possibly feasible if decision is brought about by engaging new corps.\" In further inquiries, he reported on October 15 of partial successes at Lop and Schwirnimb: \"... Coming to support after weapons success, which is aimed for in the coming days.\" He only wanted to immediately send two mortar batteries requested by the 9th Army. Thus, the exchange of ideas about bringing forces from the 8th Army to Poland initially broke off again.\nAt the same time, the already weeks-long existing muni-\n</body>\n", "090": "\n<pageno>465</pageno>\n<header>Overall Situation in the East Mid-October.</header>\n<body>to make the shortage of supplies felt in the East as well; the supply \nflowed more sparsely. The already difficult situation of the German Eastern armies \nwas further exacerbated by this.\nIn the middle Vistula, almost everything depended on the intervention \nof the advancing Austro-Hungarian forces \nsince mid-October. Regarding the question of how they should be used on the left bank of the Vistula, \ndifferences of opinion arose between Generaloberst v. Hindenburg and \nGeneral v. Conrad: the Generaloberst held \nthe view that it was possible to keep the enemy in check on the Vistula \nabove Warsaw with the existing forces, as he was continuously moving \nmore forces from this section northwards (on October 15, the XVII Corps \nwas reported as the last). However, at Warsaw, where he was constantly \nreinforcing, the situation of the German forces \nunder General v. Mackensen had to become untenable. Here, the parts of the Austro-Hungarian \n1st Army already marching north, especially the I Corps with the 12th and 46th Infantry Divisions, \nperhaps also the following 35th Infantry Division, as well as \nthe Landwehr Corps Rorda, could provide effective assistance if they, together with \nthese troops, which are currently stationed on the Vistula, were brought forward for an attack \nnorthwards. The direction of the attack was intended to be along the river \ntowards Warsaw. Such an operation seemed to promise great results, but it was conditional on the \nAustro-Hungarian troops involved being subordinated to Generaloberst v. Hindenburg.\nThe Austro-Hungarian military leadership also recognized the urgent \nnecessity to reinforce the troops in front of Warsaw, but \nin their opinion, German forces should be brought in \u2014 if necessary from the West \nor from the 8th Army from East Prussia \u2014 or an \nadvance of this army over the Narew should be undertaken. As long as \nGeneral v. Conrad was under the impression that there was an immediate danger at Nowo-Alexandria and \nIwangorod, he had readily made available to the German leadership whatever he could; however, he was not willing to \ngive up further detachments of his own troops. He \nbelieved: The continuous heavy Russian attacks suggested a deployment \nof the Austro-Hungarian forces to fill the gap that had arisen in the German \nfront, which would have meant a disintegration of the same.</body>\n<footer>1) See C. 6 ff. and 308f. \u2014 2) War Archive Vienna, Study of the Oberstltz. v.

When General v. Fran\u00e7ois moved the 36th Reserve Division south on October 26, only 2\u00bd divisions, more than half of which were Landwehr, remained north of the Rominten Heath, facing the enemy. But the Russians also seemed weakened on this front and to have shifted their forces southward1).\nd) The Decision to Retreat to the L\u00f6tzen\u2014Angerapp Position.\nSee Sketch 13 and Map 17.\nOn October 28, the expected breakthrough attempts by the Russians seemed to begin at Lake Wischtyter. Several divisions were known to be in front of the line there. Their thrust hit the weak center of the German 8th Army, where the 1st Cavalry Division stood alone between Lake Hantfisch and Lake Wischtyter. It retreated to Szittkehmen. The I Army Corps2) had to sharply bend back the 6th Landwehr Brigade as the northern flank north of Ptscherschof. The Russian attack also seemed to slip onto the Below Corps, but the line did not unfold. General v. Fran\u00e7ois decided to abandon the now recognized as hopeless offensive undertakings at the Morgen Corps and the I Army Corps. He intended to restore the situation south of Lake Wischtyter by a thrust at Ptscherschof to the north. For this, the I Army Corps was to withdraw as strong parts as possible from the front on October 29. However, Lieutenant General Kosch did not consider this feasible, as the enemy was also attacking his front. They were facing the enemy at close range, while the pressure against the 1st Cavalry Division seemed to be easing. Thus, General v. Fran\u00e7ois finally agreed on October 30 that Lieutenant General Kosch should order the resumption of the attack to the east, \"to not call into question the successes of the last days of fighting and the entire prestige against the enemy.\" However, the attack did not advance. The 36th Reserve Division even had difficulty maintaining its position. The left wing had to be extended to maintain connection with the 1st Cavalry Division, which was pushed back to the distance of the Rominten Heath on that day. To assist there, General v.

The seriousness of the ammunition situation prompted General v. Falkenhayn, just a few days after taking over the army leadership, to issue the following grave directive to the army high commands: \"Utmost frugality with artillery ammunition is required. Restrict artillery combat to long distances. Preserve stocks for decisive actions.\"\nIn contrast to the unfavorable state of artillery ammunition, the provision of ammunition for small arms, whose mass production posed no particular difficulties, was readily assured. In the previous heavy battles, on average, no more than a third of the ammunition stock planned for an army or reserve corps had been expended.\nAs challenging as the issue of remedying the artillery ammunition shortage was the railway situation behind the western army in occupied Belgium and northern France due to the persistent destruction of the local railway facilities, primarily the circular railways. But aside from this, given the poor operational conditions of the railways in use in Belgium and northern France, especially with the lack of reliable telegraph and telephone connections, it was very doubtful whether the operational capabilities required for the rapid redeployment of entire army units would be achieved.\nTo master the critical situation and all the resulting difficulties, it required not only extraordinary energy but also a willingness to take responsibility without hesitation and foresightful initiative on the part of the new leader of German operations.\nUpon assuming his new office, Lieutenant General v. Falkenhayn was 52 years old, thus, apart from the princely commanders-in-chief, younger than all commanding generals and army leaders. He did not belong to the circle of those general staff officers who had received particularly deep operational training under Field Marshal Count v. Schlieffen. Although he had found employment in both the Great General Staff and the Troop General Staff for a number of years due to excellent performance at the War Academy, it was precisely in the decade from 1896 to 1906, which was crucial for operational</body>\n<footer>1) Volume IV, p. 464 and \"The German Field Railway System\" Volume I, pp. 57ff., 84 and 202.</footer>\n", "092": "\n<pageno>467</pageno>\n<header>The Plan of General v. Conrad.</header>\n<body>Russians set. In the war diary of the High Command, it says about General Ludendorff's view on October 16: \"Initially, it is quite doubtful whether the Russian will go into the hole left to him west of Ivangorod. If the enemy goes in, only a tactical success could be achieved. It would rather be necessary \u2014 by blocking the Vistula in the area of Ivangorod and southwards \u2014 to launch a unified and strong offensive over Warsaw with all available forces, including the Austrians. However, since the Austrian 1st Army is not subordinate to the German army leader, the German army command has no influence on the operation. \u2014 The Austrian rejection of the connection of troops towards Warsaw forced the army high command to consider a withdrawal of the Mackensen group...\" In this sense, a \"secret orientation\" was issued to General v. Mackensen on October 16, in which it was further stated: It is naturally desirable that the \"retrograde movement occurs as late as possible\"; the Guard Reserve Corps holds very well at Ivangorod, so no breakthrough is expected there; at least another 48 hours must be held before Warsaw.\nThe disputes and agreements with the allies increased the difficulties of the situation to an increasing extent and took the workforce of the army high command to such an extent that General Ludendorff and Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann sharply pointed out this deficiency in a telephone conversation with the Supreme Army Command on October 17. In M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, it was recorded \"in essence\": \"The main difficulty in the east lies in the leadership of allied troops. This causes a loss of time, as Austrians are not subordinated. Ordering this from here is hopeless. The Austrian 1st Army would gladly submit to subordination. The main obstacle is Conrad. A direct imperial telegram is urgently needed to achieve the subordination of the Austrian 1st Army under the 9th Army. \u2014 Since the 9th Army is in the heaviest fighting against significant superiority, perhaps everything depends on the unity of leadership.\"\nOn the night of October 18, the German Emperor worked on Emperor Franz Josef and asked to \"immediately subordinate the 1st Army to General Hindenburg for operations in Congress Poland.\" In Vienna, they did not want to make the decision without hearing General v. Conrad. He sharply opposed the subordination: \"The concern that the Imperial and Royal 1st Army could be handed over merely for unilateral German interests, and the conviction that with the subordination under the German High Command 9 in operative</body>\n", "235": "\n<pageno>610</pageno>\n<header>Troop Movements on the German Western Front.</header>\n<body>\nSection No. | Unit | from | to | Type of Troop Movement | Loading Time or Start of Movement | a) Loading Stations b) Departure Locations\n24. | 28th Infantry Division (XIV Army Corps) | Army Detachment Strantz (5th Army) | 6th Army | Rail Transport | 3rd\u20135th Oct. | a) Sablon, b) Wippy\n25. | 29th Infantry Division (XIV Army Corps) | \" | \" | \" | \" | a) Vantour, b) Bigy, Pieblingen, Guignicourt\n26. | VII Army Corps | 2nd Army | \" | \" | 4th\u20138th Oct. | \n27. | XIX Army Corps (without 48th Infantry Brigade) | 3rd Army | \" | March | 4th Oct. | Ste.

Still unaware of the disastrous \"overall ammunition situation,\" General v. Fran\u00e7ois had wired directly to the Ministry of War in mid-October: \"Absolutely need 6 ammunition trains of cannons, 12 ammunition trains of heavy field howitzers, and 23,000 unit shells 05 immediately. Operations otherwise in question. Recommend putting individuals who delay ammunition supply before a court-martial.\" The Supreme Army Command, to which this request was forwarded, could not comply. Also, the message sent on October 19 to Generaloberst v. Hindenburg: \"Further offensive only possible with the delivery of artillery ammunition in significant quantities; have not prevented the transport of enemy forces to Warsaw,\" remained ineffective.\nThe events with the German 9th Army in Poland were also noticeable. Since October 13, it had been about the 8th Army, after the hoped-for military success by General v. Fran\u00e7ois, transferring forces to the 9th Army. When this army then initiated the retreat from the middle Vistula on October 26, the danger in the approximately 200 km deep, unprotected southern flank of the 9th Army became more serious. The more the pressure on the East Prussian eastern border eased, the stronger forces the enemy could unite against the southern border, where a new army was to be assembled for a decisive battle. General v. Fran\u00e7ois initially saw no reason to abandon his attack plans. Even on October 28, he wanted to transfer parts of his army to Thorn to the 9th Army only \"after military success\"; however, he made the extent of these transfers dependent on the size of the success achieved up to that point. On October 29, he pointed out that premature termination of the attack would gradually lead to retreat and thus the abandonment of East Prussian territory. On the evening of October 30, however, he had to report, given the development of the situation on his own front and the absence of the requested ammunition: \"Our attacks cannot be continued initially due to a lack of ammunition.\" On the evening of October 31, the order came from Generaloberst v. Hindenburg to \"prepare\" the transport of three divisions. General v. Fran\u00e7ois, however, now had the counterattack at Pscheorlin in-\n</body>\n", "164": "\n<pageno>539</pageno>\n<header>8th Army \u2014 Serious Situation Towards the End of October.</header>\n<body>to withdraw the designated Landwehr Division. It was to march north behind the front of the I Army Corps to attack Sittkehmen via Pischerosl on October 31.\nThe focal point of the battle on October 31 was also with the 1st Cavalry Division. The Landwehr Division, under its new commander, General of Infantry v. Jacobi, only reached Pischerosl and Filipow that day, while the commander of the Cavalry Division, Lieutenant General Brecht, remained reliant on his weak own forces. On orders from the Army High Command, he withdrew north, leaving minimal security in the eastern part of the heath. The Russians pressed forward. Between Lake Hantscha and Rominten, their advance was halted by the German defense, but they gained control of the southeastern tip of the heath. Further north, Lieutenant General Brecht pushed back the Russian cavalry advancing from Wischtjnez to the west; meanwhile, the 9th Landwehr Brigade had arrived north of Lake Wischtjnez, where calm prevailed on the front of Corps Below.\nThe Army High Command, based on Russian radio messages, assumed that south of Lake Wischtjnez, the Russian 29th Infantry Division was set to attack Pischerosl. On November 1, General v. Jacobi launched a counterattack from the south against them. His Landwehr Division was reinforced by the 70th Reserve Brigade of the 36th Reserve Division and the cavalry of the I Army Corps. The expected Russian advance did not materialize; without major combat, the locations on the southern edge of the heath were essentially reached. On November 2, the attack was to be continued with the involvement of reinforcements. However, the enemy attacked the southeastern corner of the heath itself the night before, overthrowing the Landwehr stationed there and capturing two guns. Repelling this opponent became the next task of Group Jacobi. Whether they would achieve anything significant beyond that was questionable, and the overall situation of the army demanded new decisions.\nThroughout October, 10\u00bd German divisions, including only 2 active and 1 cavalry division, held their ground against at least 20 Russian divisions and 8 cavalry divisions at the border. The German attacks had brought local territorial gains in places, but the overall situation had shifted decisively in favor of the defenders of East Prussia, especially over the last few weeks.

General v. Conrad has pushed further reasons to the forefront against General v. Freytag. He reported: General v. Conrad told him that the subordination from the Emperor's side \"was not approved, after a subordination of our 9th Army under Austrian command suggested by the Austrian side was rejected by us for reasons that he, Excellency Conrad, by the way, knew how to appreciate\"2).\nThe response from Emperor Franz Josef was sent on October 19 and stated: \"Following my order yesterday, to arrange for the support of your 9th Army as much as possible, Archduke Friedrich has instructed the 1st Army Command to advance in full agreement with the German 9th Army High Command against the enemy facing this army.\" Then followed details about the distribution and strength of the Austro-Hungarian forces in Russian Poland, and at the end it said: \"Thus I believe that your valued wish has been fulfilled.\" The core point of the German Emperor's request, the subordination of the 1st Army under German command, was deliberately3) not addressed. Everything remained the same.\nDuring the duration of these negotiations with the ally, the overall situation, without anything significant happening at the front, had become increasingly unfavorable: Although the Russians had gradually withdrawn ten corps from Galicia, the attack of the Austro-Hungarian army had barely advanced beyond the line where the Russians had halted their retreat. A lack of ammunition had significantly contributed to this. At Chyrow, the Russians even attacked again from October 14; the situation here was particularly difficult, as it had not yet been possible to restore the railway over the Carpathians. Thus, the right wing of the allied army was stuck in the mountains and in front of the Russian encirclement positions east of Przemy\u015bl, its center at the San. The German 9th Army High Command gained the impression from the incoming reports that the allied army no longer had the strength to bring about a decisive turn on the Galician-Polish theater of war through its attack. However, in the extremely tense situation\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) Conrad V, p. 181f. and 220f. \u2014 2) See p. 409.\n3) Letter from General v.

A decisive decision here depends solely on this thrust, so it is essential that it be conducted uniformly with all the forces of the 1st Army.\" The 1st Army was to advance into the Vistula\u2014Radom line but should no longer be weakened by contributions for the defense on the Vistula itself; this task must remain in the hands of the German troops (Landwehr Corps) previously deployed for this purpose.\nCoincidentally and completely independently of the Austro-Hungarian plan, which he did not know at all, the commanding general of the Guard Reserve Corps in front of Iwangorod expressed himself in a similar manner to the allied army command in a telephone conversation with General Ludendorff on the afternoon of the same October 16. Based on the situation of his own corps, General v. Gallwitz believed that the attack against the Russian bridgeheads was too difficult. He doubted that a \"positive success\" could be achieved through the previous \"blockade tactics\"; it cost time and resources; they must abandon it and consolidate everything for a major strike. The army's quartermaster general, Colonel v. Sauzebveig, held a similar view.\nThe supreme commander and General Ludendorff thought differently: They believed that the enemy at Iwangorod would probably only cautiously follow across the Vistula and would soon intervene again. Ludendorff also shared an unfavorable effect at this point on the immediately adjacent front of the allies. Since the Austro-Hungarian attack over the San had been delayed day by day, they doubted whether the allied troops, in the event that the Russians really came across the river in masses, had sufficient strength for a counterattack. Thus, they did not share the hopes that General v. Conrad had for the thrust against those \"emerging\" from Iwangorod.</body>\n<footer>1) War Archive Vienna, Study of Lieutenant v. Joly.</footer>\n", "020": "\n<pageno>9</pageno>\n<header>Characteristics of General v. Falkenhayn.</header>\n<body>Since the training of the General Staff had been so significant, he had been in military service in China and Kiautschou. Thus, he could no more be considered a representative of the strictly schooled strategically trained higher General Staff officers than his predecessor, Generaloberst v. Moltke. General v. Falkenhayn probably felt this lack himself and referred to himself as an \"autodidact.\" However, his long stay abroad had broadened his horizons thanks to his undoubted statesmanlike talent in various directions, especially in political terms, and he had been able to show greater worldliness here. To what extent he possessed qualities that compensated for this lack despite missing operational training, particularly inner values such as strength, drive, and firmness of will, and above all daring, which shied away from delicate deployment, enabling him to take on the most responsible and difficult position, could only be shown by his actions. Undoubtedly, in his youthful freshness, his great physical and mental agility, and the assured dexterity of his nature, he was among the prominent figures of the German army at the outbreak of war.\nGeneral v. Falkenhayn was a passionate and ambitious nature, not without inner fire, yet always controlled and reserved outwardly, not susceptible to external influence, free from a craving for people, tireless in work performance, with fabulous nerves, of great personal simplicity and lack of needs. If the judgment of the new head of operations was often very reserved, this was perhaps due to his reticence, which could create an impression of opacity, and his entire manner of presenting himself outwardly. His last plans and intentions often remained hidden even from his closest surroundings. Compared to the older army and corps leaders, he naturally lacked authority at first, which in such a position at his young age could only be the result of great military successes. Thus, with a warm heart and passionate spirit, General v. Falkenhayn probably sought such successes, which were neither hindered by the sign of dignity due to his sober and cautiously weighing manner. He was only too easily inclined to be content with smaller, but seemingly certain successes.\nThe freshness and sense of responsibility with which General v. Falkenhayn, despite the difficult situation on both theaters of war, his new</body>\n<footer>1) S. v. Hoe\u00dfl: \"Erich v. Falkenhayn\", p. 7.</footer>\n", "197": "\n<pageno>572</pageno>\n<header>Retrospective.</header>\n<body>\nSimilarly, other senior general staff officers in their diary entries made available to the Reichsarchiv often complain in quite temperamental words about the detachment of the supreme command from the front, which continuously made demands on the troops that they could not meet even with the best will during those days; as a result, trust in the higher command was severely shaken.\nIt was very concerning that a severe shortage of ammunition had already become noticeable in the first two days of the bloody battles at the Aisne. Remedying this was the most urgent demand to strengthen the combat power of the troops; the infantry attacks since the Battle of the Marne had mainly failed due to insufficient artillery support as a result of the ammunition shortage. General v. Falkenhayn, when he took over command, had no doubt about the seriousness of the ammunition situation. However, a remedy was initially not possible for the reasons outlined. The ammunition issue became increasingly urgent as the enemy transitioned to pure defense in heavily fortified positions over large parts of his front. Attacks against these required a disproportionately large use of artillery ammunition.\nOn September 15, General v. Falkenhayn made decisions of far-reaching importance for the continuation of the war far behind in Luremburg, without contact with the fighting front, in the same uncertainty as his predecessor shortly before during the leadership of the Battle of the Marne. While his predecessor, with his pessimistic disposition, fatally underestimated the favorable situation at the fighting front, General v. Falkenhayn acted in the opposite manner. Only close contact with the combat front would have allowed him to gain reliable and secure foundations for his operational decisions. With his clear vision and quick grasp of all essentials, he would have immediately recognized the futility of continuing operations in the previous paths, especially the resumption of a general offensive on the entire army front, and this insight would likely have inevitably led to other operational decisions corresponding to the situation at the front.\nInstead, the fundamental new decisions essentially consisted only of continuing the previous operational plan. By resuming the attack from the positions reached after completed withdrawals in the Noyon\u2014Verdun line, fresh forces were to be deployed.\n</body>\n", "225": "\n<pageno>600</pageno>\n<header>The German Eastern Army\non October 1, 1914\n(Later reinforcements in Latin script.)</header>\n<body>8th Army\nSubordinate to the Commander-in-Chief of the 9th Army\n(9 [later 11] Infantry Divisions, 1 Cavalry Division)\nCommander-in-Chief: General of Artillery v.

For political reasons, the attack here was maintained, but it hardly advanced. General v. Conrad considered a reinforcement of the main army in Galicia at the expense of the Balkan forces desirable, but he did not promote it, presumably because he did not feel strong enough against the head of politics, who was supported by the head of the military chancellery of Emperor Franz Josef. Despite repeated Austro-Hungarian requests for German reinforcements against Russia, the German Supreme Army Command has not intervened in the distribution of the allied forces on the Serbian and Russian fronts since the beginning of operations; only an inquiry about the actual distribution of forces was sent to General v. Freytag on October 21.\nThe distribution of the German Eastern forces on the Polish and East Prussian theaters of war also gives cause for thought. Certainly, a sharper consolidation of these forces would have been possible and more advantageous for the conduct of operations, even if it is hardly provable\n</body>\n<footer>\n<sup>1)</sup> The boundary is taken as the course of the San and the upper Vistula. \u2014 <sup>2)</sup> Including fortress garrisons and stage troops. \u2014 <sup>3)</sup> The Austro-Hungarian army was reinforced by the formation of Landsturm units and brigades. \u2014 <sup>4)</sup> Of these, about 17 against 1<sup>1/2</sup> Austro-Hungarian divisions with 30 against 12<sup>1/2</sup> rifle divisions. \u2014 <sup>5)</sup> The Austro-Hungarian 74th Reserve Division is not in this position. \u2014 <sup>6)</sup> The 12th Siberian Rifle Division is not counted, as it arrived later. \u2014 <sup>6)</sup> Note 2 on p. 549.\n</footer>\n", "257": "\n<pageno>632</pageno>\n<header>Troop Directory.</header>\n<body>\nCav.
