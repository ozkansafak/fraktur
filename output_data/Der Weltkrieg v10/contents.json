A particularly broad space has been allocated to the description of the battles at Verdun, because the unusual difficulties and the nature of that struggle, which was particularly significant for the progress of the war, only come to light when the details of the tactical conduct of the battle are presented.\nSpecial thanks for willing and valuable support are also expressed here to the War Archive in Vienna and the Historical Section, Committee of Imperial Defence in London.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "004": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is:\n\"3.

The Front of the Central Powers until Mid-March.\nAfter the conclusion of the major battles of the year 1915, the armies of the Eastern Front had gone with full force to strengthen the positions. The great width of the fronts and, in comparison, the small number of troops stood in the way of rapid and strong expansion. It took the forces almost entirely for months. In the Austro-Hungarian army, it could not be promoted to the same extent as in the German troops due to the longer duration of the autumn battles and the Russian winter attacks following in December and January, as well as due to the lower equipment with technical means of all kinds. Here as there, work in the flat, often swampy area of the Russian plain was hampered by floods or frozen ground. At the same time, extraordinary work had to be done behind the front for the maintenance and new construction of railways and roads. Access roads of all kinds, including bridges and often many kilometers long corduroy roads, had to be created. In sparsely populated areas, whose few dwellings had often become uninhabitable due to fighting and Russian retreat, it was necessary to provide accommodation for the long and harsh winter. In the construction of positions themselves, one was often forced by groundwater to raise the breastworks from earth and wood; deep dugouts were then impossible. The same resistance to shelling as in the West could not be achieved by the terrain, but with the opponent's lower equipment, shelling was not as urgent as there. Swamps and lakes, which had to represent reliable obstacles in the summer, but were more or less spared in the occupation of the front, made the Russian winter passable for a long time and thus necessitated a changed distribution of forces.\nThe southern part of the entire front was under the Austro-Hungarian army command. The border lay north of Pinsel near Telechany. In this section, the following were deployed as before: Austro-Hungarian 7th Army under Colonel General Freiherr von Pflanzer-Baltin, German South Army under General of Infantry Count Bothmer, Army Group of General of Cavalry von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli, Chief of General Staff Major General Dr. Bardolff (Austro-Hungarian 2nd and 1st Army), Army Group of Colonel General von Linsingen, Chief of General Staff Major General von Stolzmann (Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, army troops of General of Infantry von Gerok and General of Artillery von Gronau), altogether in early February 45\u00bd infantry divisions, of which six were German.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) Volume VIII, p. 540 ff., 550 ff. and 589 ff. \u2014 2) Volume IX, p. 309 ff.\n</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>\u00f6.-u. 7.

Nevertheless, the Commander-in-Chief\nEast \u2014 as he wrote on February 4 \u2014 felt obliged to return to the question. He\npointed out that there was no tactical necessity for the attack. This would require\nan increase in forces of seven to eight divisions along with strong artillery.\nThe execution depended on the onset of dry weather. General von Falkenhayn\nwas opposed to the plan given the overall situation, but reserved the decision,\nsimilar to all Balkan attack plans') until mid-March.\nMeanwhile, on March 5, the Navy approached the supreme army command\nwith the plan to take possession of the islands of Oesel and Moon, which close off\nthe Gulf of Riga*); for them, this meant an \"operation of the greatest style\" and\ncorresponding preparations. One to two divisions and strong heavy artillery\nwere required in land forces. The best time was right after the ice melted, around\nmid-April. When asked for a statement, the Commander-in-Chief East agreed,\neven if the necessary land troops (one division and heavy artillery) could not be\neasily spared from the mainland front. The precondition was that the fleet\nensured naval supremacy in the Baltic Sea and secured the connection to the\nislands. Their possession would be of particular importance if the proposed\noperation against Riga was seriously considered.

An attack on the Dvina seemed imminent. On the other hand, the 10th Army believed that a Russian attack was being prepared against the group of Lieutenant General von Hutier (General Command of the XXI Army Corps) in the area of Lake Narocz. At that time, the following were stationed:\nbetween Lake Wiszniew and Lake Narocz, the 9th Cavalry Division with the 9th Landwehr Brigade and the 75th Reserve Division; a breakthrough at this point could achieve the greatest effect for the enemy, as it would allow him to get behind the northern adjoining sections;\nbetween Lake Narocz and Lake Mjadziol, the 31st Infantry Division;\nnorth of Lake Mjadziol to the section boundary east of Goduzischki, the 115th and 42nd Infantry Divisions.\nSince the lakes were now impassable and the railway conditions for rapid reinforcement in this area were unfavorable, the Commander-in-Chief East moved the 80th Reserve Division, which was stationed west of Smorgon, behind the southern flank of the Hutier group into the area east of Lake Narocz to Smie. However, his attention had meanwhile shifted forward to the Dvina front. By March 15, he too had come to the conclusion that the main Russian attack against the Hutier group was imminent; the opposing Russian 2nd Army was extraordinarily reinforced. In response to a query from the Supreme Army Command, the Commander-in-Chief East replied on this day: According to reliable reports, the Russian XXV, V, XXVI, IV Siberian, III Siberian, XXIV, I Siberian, I, XXVII, and XV Corps, as well as two cavalry corps, were already in place or on the move. The German 8th Army was therefore also to be reinforced: 86th Infantry Division and a regiment of the 107th Landwehr Brigade from the 12th Army, 107th Infantry Division from the Scholz Army Group, and if necessary, also the reserves of the 8th Army. The report concluded: \"I have firm confidence that the 10th Army will hold its positions. As for the performance of the Russians, I have no reason to assume that their morale has declined. The number of deserters in recent times was normal. No deficiencies in armament, equipment, and supplies have become known.

The Attack Preparations of the Russians\u00b9).\nDespite the severe defeats and shocks of the summer of 1915, Tsar Nicholas declared at the Feast of St. George on January 2, 1916: \"I will not make peace until we have driven the last enemy from our land, and then only in full agreement with our allies.\" Accordingly, the Russian military leadership, headed by the Tsar himself with General Alexeyev as Chief of Staff since September 1915, prepared everything to resume the offensive with full force in 1916. The only acknowledged obstacle was the lack of rifles and the unfavorable ammunition situation. The successes of the autumn campaign in Volhynia and Litgalicia had restored confidence in their own abilities. The concern that the Central Powers, after defeating Serbia, might also subdue Romania and thus eliminate Russian influence in the Balkans, perhaps even attack Odessa, demanded swift action. Thus, the Russian plenipotentiary, General Shilinski, proposed a joint attack from Italy, the Balkans, and Galicia against Austria-Hungary during discussions in Chantilly in December 1915\u00b2), as had been desired by Russian wishes and interests since the beginning of the war and especially since Italy's entry into the war. The Tsar could assume supreme command. However, the Russian plan was rejected. In this meeting, General Shilinski exaggerated the army strength for April 1, 1916, to 2\u00be million\u00b3). Presumably, he hoped to achieve early relief through an attack by the Western powers, which he believed were unnecessarily hesitating. However, when the independently undertaken Russian winter offensives in Eastern Galicia\u2074) ended in failure and heavy losses, it became quite clear by the end of January that Russia would probably not be ready to attack until June or July, no earlier than the Western powers. Meanwhile, at the end of February, the German successes at Verdun prompted a lively exchange of ideas between the French and Russian military leadership.\n</body>\n<footer>\n\u00b9) Main sources: Russ. official value: \"Strategic Overview of the War 1914\u20141918\", V. and VI.

The armament currently consists of: 6000 machine guns, 5000 field and mountain cannons with 1270 rounds each, 585 field howitzers (12 cm) with 540 rounds each, 460 modern and 516 older heavy guns with 685 rounds each. By April, the rifle strength was to increase by about 400,000 men with the formation of five new divisions, and the number of machine guns and artillery by one-sixth of the stock. A Serbian volunteer division and a Czechoslovak volunteer brigade were formed from Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war. The attempt to form a Polish brigade in the same way failed. Instead, it was formed from Russian soldiers of Polish origin.\nIn the intentions of the Russian military leadership, a complete change had taken place. All efforts to reach a military convention with Romania had failed. The plan for a joint comprehensive attack against Austria-Hungary, which had always been in the foreground, was therefore abandoned, the change of perception justified in a memorandum by General Alexeyev as follows:\nIn view of the changed situation in the Balkans since the defeat of Serbia, Romania should have been won over first. However, this required the provision of a Russian army of 250,000 men to secure the Dobrudja against Bulgaria. On the other hand, the danger that Romania would join the ranks of the opponents if the demand was not met seemed to have diminished, as the German Balkan forces were significantly reduced, the Austro-Hungarians were occupied in Albania, and the Bulgarians were tied down by the French and English in Salonika. However, General Alexeyev was now concerned about the northern flank of the Russian front. He was thinking of a German attack on Riga with the participation of the fleet, for which the sea routes to the west, through the Skagerrak Strait, were much freer than before, as the Russian ships had the way from the north through the Moon Sound. The drift ice would tear away the Russian mine barriers in the Irben Strait and in the Gulf of Riga.\n</body>\n<footer>\n\u00b9) French official report, a.a.D., Notice 1020. \u2014 Knor (a.a.D., p. 421 f.) gives slightly lower figures.\n\u00b2) The army counted in May 1916, apart from individual Landwehr brigades in the interior and Aufsalz, 152 infantry divisions, which were increased to 163\u00bd through new formations in the summer of 1916.

The German naval forces could advance there\nbefore the Russian fleet is freed from the ice. In connection with such a German attack, there was also the possibility that Sweden would join the enemy's camp; Finland therefore needed reinforcement of troops. But such were also necessary for the Caucasus front. On the front against Germany and Austria-Hungary, defense had become more difficult because the retreat of the previous year had significantly worsened the railway situation. The network now lying behind the front was no longer sufficient to quickly bring reserves to the breach point. The transfer of a corps from the north to the southwest front took 23 days and, even if the entire supply line was interrupted, still twelve.\nUnder these circumstances, General Alexejew considered it urgent to preempt the Germans with an attack in the north.\nHe justified this intention in the meeting on February 27 by stating that in the north, the Russian forces outnumbered the enemy by about 400,000 rifles = 47 percent, while in the south they were equal. In the north, the resistant enemy stood with a greater number of heavy artillery and technical aids of all kinds. A success there would bring the Russian army closer to Berlin and thus to the center of the enemy alliance; it could therefore have an enormous impact and influence the outcome of the war. The southern theater of war was of lesser importance. To prepare for the attack, army reserves had to be brought to about 18 corps. As a result of the meeting, it was determined that the main attack against the Germans should be conducted from the left wing of the northern front and the right of the western front. In total, 400,000 men were envisaged for this, with reinforcements from the southwest front. If the attack was successful, the southwest front should also go on the offensive.\nThe timing for the attack depended on the \"impassability\" expected in spring due to the snowmelt and the completion of equipment with rifles. Until the aforementioned, urgently needed expansion of heavy artillery was completed, General Alexejew did not want to wait but was content with reinforcement only for two heavy units already in formation, totaling 24 guns. Finally, the concern about an impending German attack on Riga became so great that he decided to attack in the area east of Daugavpils before the start of the snowmelt. Also, on the 2nd and again on the 5th of March, a relief attack was requested by the French military leadership to prevent further German troops from being moved from the Eastern to the Western Front.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>5.

The mass attacks of the Russian infantry, which began about three hours later at these positions and were repeatedly renewed after each new artillery preparation, collapsed already in the snowfield of the German position garrison. The dead, who remained lying in front of both the southern and northern flanks of the group, were estimated at about 4000 each. This was opposed by a loss of only about 200 men on the German side. Russian deception operations in other sections of the front were soon recognized as such. Only small parts of the German reserves had participated so far.\nOn March 19, the Russian attacks against the northern flank of the 42nd Infantry Division were repeated with particular intensity and in even greater breadth than the day before. They now also attacked the southern flank of the adjacent group of Lieutenant General von Garnier (Higher Cavalry Commander 6). As long as it remained light, all attempts were repelled. In the darkness, at 9 p.m., however, the enemy managed to penetrate the position of the 42nd Infantry Division with parts of four divisions in a width of not yet 400 meters. A counterattack quickly organized by the division commander, Lieutenant General von Bredow, at dawn on March 20, with reserves quickly assembled, drove the Russians out again. However, the situation in the entrenched trenches of this section began to become difficult due to rising meltwater.\nFollowing minor combat activity on March 20, new heavy Russian attacks followed at the previous focal points of the battle on the night of March 21. The enemy penetrated the sharply protruding part of the section of the 75th Reserve Division at the southern end of Lake Narocz, which lost 2500 men and had to withdraw its defense into a line position during the day. The enemy also managed to penetrate the positions on the northern flank of the 42nd Infantry Division again on March 21. Here, with the involvement of parts of the 107th Infantry Division that had been deployed in the meantime, they could be driven out again by evening and lost 600 men alone as prisoners. In view of the extraordinarily heavy losses suffered by the Russians in front of this section, Lieutenant General von Hutier initially considered the danger there to be averted. He turned his attention to the southern flank.\nMeanwhile, the enemy had also continued to attack further north. In the Army Group Scholtz, the thrusts led by about four Russian corps began on March 19. They were primarily directed against the positions of the 3rd Infantry Division near Wisly and the 87th Infantry Division at Driswjathy Lake.

They had no success anywhere. In front of the 8th Army, the enemy seemed to be concentrating strong forces, a total of ten divisions, in the area of Jakobstadt and showed active operations here on March 21, so that General Otto von Below expected an imminent attack. An operation directed on the same day south of Riga against the 6th Reserve Division might have been merely a diversion.\nOn March 21, the Eastern Commander-in-Chief reported to the Supreme Army Command, upon their inquiry about the state of the battle, a report in which he described the strong deployment of Russian forces against the 10th Army. Since the enemy had used drumfire on a large scale for the first time, the battles were severe, but he was confident that the 10th Army would hold its positions. The significance of the battles that flared up on the Dvina front was not yet clear. That further attacks, perhaps at other points on the front, would follow with the deployment of Russian guards or other troops withdrawn from the Austro-Hungarian front was possible, as it apparently was not just operations to relieve the French, but the great Russian spring offensive.\nOn March 22, the enemy made only a futile attempt to attack the 10th Army against the Landwehr, which held the section of the 9th Cavalry Division at the extreme right wing of the Sontier Group. The most fiercely contested part of the group front, directly adjoining Lake Narocz, was taken over by the 80th Reserve Division. Troops of the 86th Infantry Division had already been inserted here. Behind them, as a new reserve coming from the army group Prince Leopold, the 119th Infantry Division was expected. In view of this accumulation of troops, Generaloberst von Eichhorn ordered on March 23 the transfer of the entire section south of Lake Narocz to the group of General von Carlowitz (General Command of the III Reserve Corps), which until then had only two divisions under its command on a narrow and quiet front.\nIn the Army Group Scholz, the Russians had repeated their attacks on the night of March 22 and extended them northward to the group of Lieutenant General von Launestien (General Command XXXIX Reserve Corps). In the 8th Army, the strengthened attack at Jakobstadt had hit the positions of the 109th and 41st Infantry Divisions, a weaker thrust at Friedrichstadt the 36th Reserve Division.

It was no different for him when he repeated his attempts the following day. At Jakobstadt, however, his offensive strength seemed far from exhausted. The Commander-in-Chief East therefore requested the 22nd Infantry Division, which had meanwhile been released from the Austro-Hungarian front and provided by the Supreme Army Command at Baranowicze, as a reserve to Mitau.\nThe following days brought only weak repetitions of the Russian attacks against the Scholtz Army Group and the 8th Army. They ended on March 26 with another very strong attempt against the 41st Infantry Division, which, like all previous attempts, remained unsuccessful. Thus, the Russian offensive strength at the Dvina section was exhausted. The German losses remained very low.\nThe Commander-in-Chief East had already considered the situation with the German 10th Army as stabilized on March 23. Persistent thawing weather, which caused the water in the trenches of the lower sections to rise up to a meter, made further combat activity increasingly impossible in the coming days. Only against the northern flank of the Hutier Group (107th Infantry Division) did the enemy make another unsuccessful attempt on March 26. Since then, he seemed to be withdrawing troops from the front line, an impression that was fully confirmed by aerial reconnaissance and finally by intercepted radio messages on April 3. The ice of the Dvina also broke now, the river rose by 1\u00bd meters. Despite the unfavorable weather, the enemy tried again on April 6 and 7, but again unsuccessfully, to gain ground south of Lake Narocz. On April 9, the Commander-in-Chief East reported to the Supreme Army Command that the high water would make a unified attack by strong Russian masses unlikely in the near future. However, he emphasized that a repetition of the attacks, and indeed by considerably stronger forces than before, was to be expected once the road conditions improved. This could occur faster than in normal years due to the dry weather.\nMeanwhile, the General Command of the III Reserve Corps was preparing a counterattack south of Lake Narocz to regain the position lost on March 21, which, due to its high location, dominates the surrounding area. Difficulties in the supply of ammunition and attack equipment forced the operation initially scheduled for April 13 to be postponed to the 28th.

The Russian March offensive could be considered failed. It had completely collapsed in the German defensive fire and in the mud of the snowmelt. A German total loss of more than 20,000 men (including, according to Russian accounts, 2000 to 3000 prisoners), of which about 15,000 were in the 10th Army, faced a Russian total loss of 110,000 men. Of them, 10,000 had been captured. German troops had fully proven themselves under the most difficult combat conditions against overwhelming forces. What they suffered and achieved in the frost and mud of the Russian snowmelt justified the highest expectations. Timely measures by the leadership had supported them within the limits of what was possible.\nAccording to the Commander-in-Chief East, the Russians had not abandoned their attack plans but merely postponed them to wait for more favorable weather. At the beginning of May, numerous consistent reports from aerial reconnaissance indicated the concentration of strong Russian forces in front of the 8th and especially in front of the inner flanks of the 10th and 12th Armies. He requested the 5th Reserve Division, which was available to him at Baranowicze as a reserve of the Supreme Army Command, which was then moved behind his left flank to Bogdanow. When the expected attack did not occur, General von Falkenhayn requested an assessment of the situation on May 18. The Commander-in-Chief East reported that the Russians had assembled five to six corps at Smorgon, six to seven at D\u00fcnaburg, with two more behind them on the Wilna-Dvinsk railway. \u201cThis regrouping of forces carried out in recent weeks, the construction of extensive attack trenches, the appearance of numerous new batteries and their firing against our trenches around battery positions, and finally the bringing in of large quantities of ammunition are unmistakable signs that the Russians intend to attack the mentioned sections.\u201d These signs were supplemented by troop reports and deserter statements. According to them, a new attack had been expected eight to ten days ago, but it had been postponed from day to day. The reason was not quite clear.

In any case, the Russians are grouped in such a way that they could launch an attack with strong forces at any time. An attack with weaker forces on both sides of Lake Narocz, from the bridgehead Jakobstadt or south of Riga, is also possible. The report concluded: \"The army group faces any Russian attack with confidence. A withdrawal of reserves or a transition to an offensive on our part is excluded given the current Russian distribution of forces.\" General von Falkenhayn replied that a withdrawal of forces was not intended, \"unless urgent need arises on the Galician front\"; in this case, however, a reduction of Russian forces in front of the Commander-in-Chief East's front is also to be expected.\nWhen the Kaiser inspected the Eastern Front with General von Falkenhayn at the end of May and Field Marshal von Hindenburg gave him a lecture in Vilna on May 29*), the Russians in front of the army group's front were estimated at 76\u00bd divisions with 1224 battalions, opposed by only 36\u00bd German divisions with even only 437 battalions, including 64 from the Landsturm. However, the Russians seemed to be withdrawing troops from D\u00fcnaburg and Riga since the beginning of the Austro-Hungarian offensive against Italy (May 15). The initial target was considered to be the Galician front. It was also possible that it was a reinforcement of the attack group against the inner flanks of the 12th and 10th Armies*). A Russian attack was faced \"with absolute confidence.\" If it were repelled, the suspicion that forces would be sent to the Austro-Hungarian front would be confirmed, so it was to be considered how the reserves of the army group should be used. Whether two to three divisions in the West were of decisive importance seemed doubtful, and it was also questionable to take them away from the East, as they might be needed with Prince Leopold's army group or on the Austro-Hungarian front. Therefore, it was to be considered whether to proceed with an attack despite the enemy's superiority. A breakthrough through the Russian front seemed possible everywhere, as the positions were poorly developed and the morale of the Russian troops was no longer the same.

The responsibility here fell solely to Generaloberst von Conrad. In doing so, a clear separation of the tasks to be fulfilled in the defense against Russia was carried out, which took into account the independence of the Austro-Hungarian military leadership as far as possible, while General von Falkenhayn, by leaving the German army group command Linsingen and the High Command of the German South Army, also continued to secure the influence and insight he deemed necessary. The demarcation corresponded to the forces as well as the special concerns of each of the allies. It was adhered to, although the Austro-Hungarian military leadership continued to include the army group Gronau, which stood with its main forces north of the Pripet, as part of the army group Linsingen. This crossing of the boundary of command areas ensured the cohesion of the front, which experience has shown to be easily disrupted at such points. The continuation of the fighting in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia resulted in the further deviation that two Austro-Hungarian divisions (XII Corps) north of the Pripet with the army group Prince Leopold and for that German troops in corresponding strength should remain south of the Pripet\u00b2). Furthermore, General von Falkenhayn had pointed out to the allied Chief of General Staff in December that no right should be derived from the Austro-Hungarian undertakings against Montenegro and Albania, which were then under discussion, to delay the withdrawal of the German units standing south of the Pripet. In January 1916, the defense against the Russian winter attacks prompted him to further caution that pure defense should not lead to the German troops being tied down on the Austro-Hungarian Eastern Front for an indefinite period. During the discussion on February 3rd\u00b3), he pointed out in view of the imminent attack on Verdun that the German Corps Gerok\u00b9) would be withdrawn from the Linsingen Army Group if needed; each of the allies was solely responsible for holding their front.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>darauf hin, da\u00df das deutsche Korps Gerok\u00b9) im Falle des Bedarfs aus der Heeresgruppe Linsingen abberufen werde; jeder der Verb\u00fcndeten sei f\u00fcr das Halten seiner Front allein verantwortlich.</fragment_2>", "028": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die Frontbesetzung war, trotz der Schw\u00e4chung im\".

In this situation, General\nvon Falkenhayn requested and received the ally's consent to also withdraw\nthe Marshal's General Command and the 3rd Guard Infantry Division\nfrom the German Southern Army for the West.

By the end of April, only\nthe High Commands of the Linsingen Army Group and the German\nSouthern Army, the 48th, and on the extreme northern flank the majority\nof the 82nd Reserve Division, remained under German command.\nBy the end of April, Generaloberst von Conrad had also withdrawn\ntroops from the Austro-Hungarian Eastern Front, amounting to six divisions,\nwhich he intended to use against Italy. He had replaced two of them with\ntroops from the Balkans and from border protection against Romania\u00b2).\nHis hope for the use of Turkish forces was disappointed. Only a weak\ndivision for the Isonzo Front was to be brought in through time-consuming\ntransports, but partly due to railway conditions, partly due to losses on\nthe Asia Minor front\u00b3), without heavy weapons, vehicles, and horses. In\naddition, the little help offered in Constantinople \u2014 as reported by an\nAustro-Hungarian officer sent there \u2014 was regarded as the \"salvation of\nthe monarchy.\" Under these circumstances, Generaloberst von Conrad\nhad already completely abandoned them at the beginning of March.

However, the ammunition supply (400 rounds for each field cannon2)) was only about half of the amounts available at the German sections of the Eastern Front. Whether Generaloberst von Conrad was aware of this, and to what extent he made reductions in favor of the front against Italy, is not known. In any case, the Chief of the General Staff was convinced that the increase in fighters and guns would suffice to compensate for the deductions, especially of the most combat-effective and internally valuable units and formations3).\nHe viewed the Russian attack, as did the army leaders, with full confidence, after the Austro-Hungarian troops had succeeded in repelling all Russian attacks on their own in January4).

Who wants to take responsibility for the steadfastness of the Austrians? No one can! On the other hand, the Russians can do nothing at the moment, especially since they have weakened themselves considerably.\" He replied that he \u2014 under the present circumstances \u2014 considered the security of the section to be absolutely guaranteed. However, if the enemy were to bring in stronger forces, no German leader could take responsibility.\nWhen the ground was dry enough for larger operations to become possible again at the beginning of May, the distribution of Russian forces across the entire front seemed to be the same as in March; approximately two-thirds of the divisions were correctly assumed to be north, only one-third south of the Pripjet. However, the Commander-in-Chief East continued to expect a resumption of Russian attacks against his front.\nMeanwhile, since mid-May, signs of Russian attack preparations against the front south of the Pripjet became noticeable. Contrary to the previously practiced strong restraint in the air, Russian air units advanced over the combat front and attacked towns and railway stations with bombs on May 31. The enemy also showed increased artillery activity against the right flank of the Austro-Hungarian 7th and especially the 4th Army. Generaloberst von Conrad found it necessary to return the Austro-Hungarian 13th Infantry Division, which had been temporarily withdrawn from this army behind the right army wing to the 7th Army, to the 4th Army and to reinforce its artillery with eight heavy batteries. During the meeting with General von Falkenhayn in Berlin on May 24, he emphasized the need to obtain assurance once again that if the Russians were to bring stronger forces from the north into the area south of the Pripjet, which would take them about three weeks, he could also count on corresponding reinforcement of his front by German troops.

An offensive at Smorgon, however, was still expected. On the evening of June 2, he reported that the attack against the German 10th Army and the northern flank of the 12th was \"due to break.\" On the other hand, the situation on the Italian front also made a relief offensive against the Austro-Hungarian Eastern Front increasingly likely. The signs for this increased. Against the right flank of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, the Russian attack measures had now advanced so far that Generaloberst Freiherr von Pflanzer-Baltin concentrated his reserves there on May 28. Tension also increased with the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, but leaders and troops faced the Russian attack with confidence.

However, Generaloberst von Conrad had turned his full attention to Italy and felt, as far as known, in agreement with all the higher leaders of the Austro-Hungarian front section, capable of withstanding any Russian onslaught.

This superiority was double north of the Rokitno Marshes, while south it was only one-sixth.\nOn April 14, a meeting was held under the chairmanship of the Tsar in Mogilev. General Alexeyev presented the following plan based on his memorandum: With reinforcement by the 1st Army, the northern front would be five times superior in number to the enemy. It advances with four corps from Riga to Mitau. A few days later, the western front, six times superior in number to the enemy, attacks Wilna, if necessary, it will be further strengthened by the guards stationed north of it. The southwestern front seeks to divert the enemy's attention and prepares to attack from Rovno as soon as the offensive north of the Rokitno Marshes is underway.\nThe main attack was thus to fall again on the western front. Generals Kuropatkin and Ewcrt, commanders of the northern and western fronts, however, raised serious concerns. Both were under the fresh impression of their previous completely unsuccessful attacks. The German positions, they argued, were so strongly built and so deeply structured that a new attack would be hopeless without a similar deployment of heavy artillery as the enemy used for his attacks. The war minister General Shuvayev, who was also present, stated that he could provide ammunition for light guns in the usual quantity, but heavy guns and their ammunition could not be provided in the required amount, certainly not in the summer of 1916. Under these circumstances, General Ewcrt, who had unsuccessfully requested eight corps as reinforcements before the meeting to resume the attack, considered it best to remain on the defensive until sufficient heavy artillery with ample ammunition was available. He also opposed the attack on two spatially distant locations; one must decide on one location, either on the northern or the western front. For the latter, he demanded a preparation time of at least one, preferably two months.\nGeneral Brusilov, since early April commander of the southwestern front, expressed himself quite differently. He considered any waiting to be undesirable and emphasized, pointing to the excellent spirit of his troops, that the southwestern front could not only, but must attack as soon as the other fronts were attacked, even if there was a lack of aircraft, horses, vehicles, and ammunition.</body>\n<footer>1) A.

Each division was assigned an attack width of about 2.3 kilometers. 148 battalions were to be deployed against 53 of the enemy, 670 guns, including 74 heavy ones (out of 155, which the army group had in total) were to be concentrated in this main attack section. 70 kilometers further north, the 4th Cavalry Corps (one infantry and four cavalry divisions) was to be ready to break through the enemy front on the railway leading to Kowel by June 5 at the latest and to disrupt the enemy's rear connections. From the 11th Army, the VI Corps (two divisions) was to attack on both sides of the Tarnopol\u2014Lemberg railway with 28 battalions against 16 enemy ones, while the 7th Army's II Corps (three divisions) was to attack just south of the Buczacz\u2014Stanislau railway. In the 9th Army, the XI, a composite, and the XII Corps (together six divisions) were to advance close to the Romanian border between the Dniester and Pruth.\nFor the secrecy of the intentions, everything possible was done. Each attack was to be prepared with the greatest certainty down to the smallest detail. The instructions given for this corresponded to the German procedures of the time. The infantry had to work its way up to at least 250 meters before the enemy. Since the leader of the main attack, General Kaledin, did not seem to have enough confidence in success, General Brussilov personally sought him out and managed to \"not only win him over but actually enthuse him\" in an hour-long conversation about his task. On the night before the start of the attack, General Alexeyev again raised serious concerns about the simultaneous attack by four armies and also referred to the Tsar's opinion. However, General Brussilov remained committed to the plan he considered correct, offering his resignation, which was now no longer possible to change.\nOn June 4, between 4 and 5 in the morning, the attack preparations by the artillery began on all four armies of the southwestern front. The duration of the fire was left to the individual armies. Thus, the infantry attack of the 11th Army began after six, and the 9th after eight hours. The 8th Army, which led the main strike, wanted its infantry to advance only after 29 hours of fire on June 5 at around 10 a.m., while the 7th Army even waited 45 hours until dawn on June 6.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "037": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Reservens waren zum Gegensto\u00df angesetzt.\" This sentence appears complete with a period at the end, suggesting it is not a fragment.\n\n<fragment_1>Reservens waren zum Gegensto\u00df angesetzt.</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"Von der Heeresgruppe Linsingen erfuhr man in Teschen bis zum sp\u00e4ten Abend, da\u00df starkes Feuer vor allem auf der Mitte der \u00f6.-u. 4.

At the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, the enemy attacked immediately south of Olesnica and advanced to Ofta; counterattacks were initiated. Russian attacks against the German South Army led only to temporary breaches on its northern flank. In the B\u00f6hm-Ermolli Army Group, there were partial attacks.

Already in the morning, after the first reports \nabout the start of the attack, Colonel General von Linsingen had requested the \n25th Infantry Division, which was held as an army reserve behind the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army. \nHowever, Colonel General von Conrad could not decide to fulfill this request given the still unclear overall situation. \nThe reports about the enemy in front of the army group confirmed the concentration of the Russian XXXX Corps in a narrow \narea and the deployment of the VIII Corps in the front line between \nXXXII and XXXX Corps. Behind these assault troops, further \nforces were reported on the march, including two cavalry divisions. Colonel \nGeneral von Linsingen reported in the evening from Jablon: \"The order \nof General Brussilow and the concentration of forces on and south of \nthe Rowno\u2014Klewan\u2014Lucz road suggest the intention of an attack \nagainst the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 37th, center of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd, and the Hungarian \n70th Infantry Division as well as the left wing of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Infantry Division. \nThe strength of the enemy and the relatively \nminor damage from his artillery fire promise no success for him. The attack against the 4th Infantry Division is considered by the \narmy group command as a mere demonstration.\"\nUnder the impression of this favorable assessment on the one hand, and the \nRussian incursions at the 7th and 1st Army on the other, Colonel General \nvon Conrad decided to march the Austro-Hungarian 25th Infantry Division \nsouth to Rudnia, to deploy it from there as needed \nfor a counterattack at Spanow in front of the 1st Army or also by rail to the \n7th Army.\nAt the 7th Army, on June 5th, south of the Dniester, \nthere were again fierce battles. Essentially, further \nadvancement of the enemy was prevented. However, the defender's consumption of forces was \nso great that holding out without new reserves no longer seemed \nguaranteed. To make such available, Colonel \nGeneral Freiherr von Pflanzer-Baltin decided to withdraw his forces standing in the area of Zaleczkyi \nto the left riverbank during the night of June 6th behind the Dniester. At the Strypa front, \ndrumfire lay on the lines of the XIII Corps at Jazlowice; an intervention \nseemed imminent.

According to prisoner statements, parts of the Russian Guard had arrived in Tarnopol, and strong forces seemed to be gathering here. In front of the B\u00f6hm-Ermolli army group, the enemy strengthened in the area of Kremeniece. In the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, he had made some progress north of Sopanno. The Austro-Hungarian troops had suffered heavy losses. The army group urgently requested the assignment of the Austro-Hungarian 25th Infantry Division.\nIn the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, the artillery fire of the previous day, as it turned out on the night of June 5th, had caused significant damage to the positions. However, the losses were within tolerable limits; the Hungarian 70th Infantry Division, which had probably suffered the most, counted a total of 57 dead and 170 wounded out of a total strength of around 12,000. The enemy's losses were said to be much greater; 1,900 dead and wounded Russians were said to be lying in front of the front. At the army group command, there was full confidence. The 4th Army would be pleased that it was right and that the enemy was now really attacking, General von Stolzmann had written in his diary. Generaloberst von Linsingen had told the defenders that he was convinced that every leader with his troops was inspired by the idea that \"holding out in the positions to the last man was necessary to nullify the weak attacks undertaken by the Russians to balance the successes in South Tyrol.\" In the event of a local breakthrough, he had recommended using the reserves in a unified, as comprehensive as possible counterattack. On the other hand, the army commander, Archduke Josef Ferdinand, had already seen fit to order the saving of artillery ammunition.\nOn the night of June 5th and early morning, the intensity of the Russian infantry attacks increased. Since they were all repelled and the Archduke reported quite hopefully, Generaloberst von Linsingen expected a complete failure of the enemy. In this sense, he reported to the Supreme Army Command in the morning. During the day, however, the situation took an unfavorable turn. The first sign of the shift was the report from the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, which arrived at 10 a.m. and stated that after very heavy drumfire northwest of Olyka, a strong Russian attack by one of the local regiments had forced a retreat to the second position. The entire 13th Infantry Division had been made available to the X Corps to retake the first position. Gradually, however, it became apparent that the enemy had thrown the center of the army, the Austro-Hungarian 2nd and the Hungarian 70th Infantry Division, out of the first and partly also out of the second position.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>fanterie-Division, aus der ersten und zum Teil auch aus der zweiten Stellung geworfen hatte.</fragment_2>", "040": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"nach den Erfahrungen bei der 4.

The army remnants (11th and 13th Infantry Division) were already entangled in the retreat, which came to a halt with all four divisions only in the poorly developed third and last position. Thus, the front was pushed in on a width of about 25 kilometers and pushed back up to six kilometers. The troops had suffered heavy losses; some regiments are said to have not counted at all, others lost 40 to 50 percent of their combat strength. In view of the size of the losses as well as the \"shattered mental state of the troops and their leaders\"), even the next stand was questionable. The 4th Army no longer had any significant reserves, the army group only had half of the Austrian 45th Infantry Division behind the northern flank of this army. Generaloberst von Linsingen marched south and ordered the Gronau army group to send five battalions by rail via Brest-Litovsk\u2014Kovel. From these troops and artillery of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, a new division was to be assembled, but it could not be ready behind the breakthrough point before June 7. Meanwhile, the 4th Army Command was urged to bring the troops to a standstill through personal influence on the lower leaders and to take into account the neighboring groups; only then could success be expected from the introduction of the reserves.\nThe simultaneous serious battles at the Austro-Hungarian 7th, 1st, and 4th Army had \u2014 as already emerged \u2014 not only resulted in territorial losses, but, what weighed much more heavily, brought considerable losses in people and material. Generaloberst von Conrad faced difficult decisions. Three divisions were still available, one behind the German South Army and behind the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, as well as the Austro-Hungarian 25th Infantry Division of the 1st Army, which had already been set in motion to the south. The situation of this army seemed to be more difficult than that of the 7th Army, which had essentially repelled the enemy on June 5 and also had the possibility of creating new reserves in its own area. On the other hand, the 1st Army, which had suffered heavy losses at Sopronow, seemed particularly threatened by the arrival of new enemy forces at Krzemieniec. Generaloberst von Conrad therefore decided to release the Austro-Hungarian 25th Infantry Division of the B\u00f6hm-Ermolli army group for deployment with the 1st Army in case of urgent need, with the explicit reservation, based on the experiences with the 4th Army, that this division should only be used uniformly.</body>\n<footer>1) Austrian official work, Volume IV, p. 387.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "041": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Durch Heranf\u00fchrung einer zusammengesetzten\".

He informed the army group command that it would have to manage without Austro-Hungarian assistance. At 10:15 in the evening, he urged General von Falkenhayn: \"So far, the Russians have achieved successes on a section of our 7th Army's front south of the Dniester and today also west and southwest of Rovno opposite the 4th Army.\" The local superiority of the enemy south of the Dniester and the importance of this section, which borders directly on Romania, compelled the sending of available reserves there. Based on the discussion from May 24<sup>1</sup>, he initially requested that available forces, possibly from the German Eastern Front, be transferred via Kowel to the Linsingen Army Group. The assembly of strong Russian forces near Tarnopol might soon necessitate a request for reinforcement for the German Southern Army.\nStill unaware of the extent and disastrous impact of the Russian breakthrough at the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, General von Falkenhayn initially believed that the Austro-Hungarian military leadership would have to manage without German assistance. In his responses, he pointed out that, according to the agreement of May 24, German forces should only be deployed if the enemy had made significant shifts from the north to Galicia. Currently, that was not the case; the Russians were rather facing the German Eastern Front with triple superiority, fully prepared for an attack. He recommended, in light of the Southern Army's report that enemy fire had been kept within moderate limits and that troops had been observed moving backward in vehicle traffic before the middle of the army, to relieve the German forces there and transfer them to the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. Furthermore, he had General von Cramon point out that due to the lack of available German reserves, the only option left was to take troops from the Italian front, including South Tyrol. This was bitter, but he saw no other way out. If the enemy shifted parts of his forces from the German Eastern Front to the south, he would not hesitate to send German troops for support.\nWhile this decision was being made, Generaloberst von Linsingen supplemented his evening report to the German Supreme Army Command by explaining that the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army had partially retreated in panic with severe losses, although the enemy had apparently only deployed the VIII Corps and three cavalry divisions as reinforcements so far. By bringing in a composite division, he attempted to hold the wavering line.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Division versuche er die wankende Linie zu halten.</fragment_2>", "042": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Bei der \u00f6.-u. 1.

Given the condition of the troops, which had shrunk significantly and become almost ineffective in a short time, he could not take responsibility for them not retreating further in the face of enemy reinforcements. The requested support from the Austro-Hungarian 25th Infantry Division had been declined. He felt compelled to again draw attention to the weak hold of the troops, as he had repeatedly reported, \"only within the framework of German troops can they hold.\" This was followed by the wording of his report to Teschen: The 4th Army Command, despite twice being advised of the necessity for vigorous resistance and the imperative use of strong reserves, had dribbled these into the defensive front and repeatedly reported favorably on the conditions at the front; its leadership had completely failed. This evening, it had only ordered a retreat for its corps to the third line based on a pessimistic report from General Surmay. He had come to the conviction that the retreat was premature and undertaken without compelling reason, and that the lack of purposeful leadership of the army was primarily to blame.\nThese reports prompted General von Falkenhayn to thoroughly examine the question of German support; however, he doubted, as he immediately expressed to Colonel General von Linsingen, that German forces would arrive in time at the army group. Inquiries with the Commander-in-Chief East and the Army Group Prince Leopold revealed that the latter army group offered a brigade of Landwehr along with artillery for immediate transport. The Commander-in-Chief East, despite the extremely threatening Russian attack preparations, was prepared to divert the 108th Infantry Division, which was just completing its reserve duty near Vilna, to the south, provided he was promptly supplied with replacements from the west. Until a decision was made, the railway was fully occupied with transports from Army Group Gronau and Army Group Prince Leopold.\nOn June 6, the Russian attacks on the southern armies were limited to the front of the Austro-Hungarian 7th and the German South Army, which held their positions without difficulty. However, Colonel General von Pflanzer reported from the 7th Army that the resistance strength of the Austro-Hungarian 15th Infantry Division of the XIII Corps had suffered significantly from the Russian fire. In the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, the 25th Infantry Division was to restore the situation at the breach point of Sopnawo, with the necessary ammunition to be supplied by the neighboring 2nd Army.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>mit der dazu n\u00f6tigen Munition mu\u00dfte die benachbarte 2.

However, Archduke Josef Ferdinand had already \ninformed all three corps of his army of the sections to be occupied during \nthe retreat behind the river and reported at 11:45 a.m. that attempts to \nstop the troops were in vain. \"The good regiments have shrunk very \nmuch due to combat losses, the Ruthenians fail almost completely.\" \nThere is not much to hope for from the marching half of the 45th Infantry \nDivision. A Russian thrust on Luck finds no corresponding resistance \nanymore. The Archduke here considered the danger of a \"complete \nbreakthrough and encirclement of the X Corps\" to be great, \"which would \nalso call into question holding the Styr line.\" \nGeneraloberst von Linsingen, who hoped to have the composite division, \nincluding five battalions and three batteries of German troops, ready at \nPalcza the next day, again urged at 3:35 p.m., but in vain, to hold the \nposition. In the evening, it turned out that the front line of the army \nfrom Mlynow, where there was still a connection to the left flank of the \nAustro-Hungarian 1st Army, ran behind Staw and Styr to the southern \nend of the outer bridgehead of Luck, then suddenly past Nierow through \ninaccessible forest area to the last Styr lowland near Kosti. Here, the \nclosing Corps Fath had already had to bend its right flank back somewhat. \nBy the retreat of the entire Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, a bulge of 75 \nkilometers wide and 20 kilometers deep had formed within three days. \nOf the 8<sup>1/2</sup> infantry divisions of the army, hardly half were still \nsomewhat combat-effective.

For the time being, however, only half of the Austrian 45th Infantry Division was available at Riwnecy, which was to be brought up to divisional strength by German troops during the course of June 7. In addition to this half-division, the following were anticipated: from the Gronau Army Group, a cavalry brigade; from the Prince Leopold Army Group, the 28th Landwehr Brigade; and in a few days from the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, the Austro-Hungarian 29th Infantry Division. General of Cavalry von Bernhardi was to take command of all these troops.\nBefore the newly forming division was ready on June 7, a new Russian attack hit the entire front of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. The army command had been moved from Lucz to the railway leading from Kowel to Perespa in the morning, where the Bernhardi Corps was to assemble. In the afternoon, the parts of the Surmay Corps and the X Corps deployed in the bridgehead of Lucz, a double line of fortified and barricaded positions, retreated. Under the pursuit fire of Russian artillery, \"infantry and batteries hastened in wild flight\" across the Styr. But even the Austro-Hungarian II Corps on the left, which had suffered little until then, continued the retreat along the entire front and left only small rear guards on the right bank of the Styr. By evening, the entire Austro-Hungarian 4th Army was completely shaken behind the river. The depth of the incursion was already 40 kilometers and more. At the request of Generaloberst von Linsingen, Generaloberst Archduke Josef Ferdinand had been relieved of his position. His successor, Generaloberst Terszty\u00e1nszky von N\u00e1das, was still awaited. Generaloberst von Linsingen himself was initially tied to this rather remote headquarters due to the connections converging in Jablon. In his view, the immediate concern was whether it would be possible to hold the Styr line. A continuous, albeit not fully developed position on the heights of the west bank and the strong water obstacle in front favored the defense. Nevertheless, it was questionable whether the Surmay Corps and the X Corps, whose troops were described as demoralized by the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army command, would hold the river crossing. The Linsingen High Command expected the front to falter again. It wanted to gather its reserves at Perespa, ready to attack southward on the western bank of the Styr as soon as the enemy crossed the river.\n</body>\n<footer>1) Previously commander of the 49th R.D. with the 9th Army (Army Group Prince Leopold).\n2) Austrian official work, Volume IV, p. 400.\n3) Last commander-in-chief of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, Volume IX, p. 206.\n</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>den Flu\u00df vordringe.</fragment_2>", "045": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"So hatte sich General von Falkenhayn in der Nacht\".

For the Corps Fath in the north, which, like the Corps Hauer, had repelled repeated Russian attacks since the evening of June 6, there was therefore no concern. In the south, however, the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army had already had to bend its left wing westward and was to take over the Ikwa and Styr section up to about 15 kilometers south of Lucz on the orders of the Austro-Hungarian High Command from June 8; the Austro-Hungarian 7th Infantry Division was then to join it. This shifted the focus of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army northward. The army command was moved to Wladimir-Wolynsk.\nOn this day, June 7, the situation with the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army had also taken a new, very serious turn. The Russians had broken into the positions of the XIII Corps at Jazlowie and had pushed through in pursuit beyond the Strypa. By evening, the front had been pushed back more than 20 kilometers wide, from the Dniester to the railway east of Buczacz, four to five kilometers behind the Strypa into the second line of defense running there. The local command considered it possible that order and composure might return to leaders and troops by the following morning, but the High Command was already preparing for the possibility that the coming days might bring significant territorial losses. Since the army's reserves had already been used up, the Southern Army had to assist.

Moreover, it was a front section for whose defense Generaloberst von Conrad was primarily responsible with his own troops.

If they did not come at all, it could \"actually happen that the Russians, with numerically barely equal forces, would reshape the entire war situation in the East to their advantage.\" The response from Teschen was delayed. Before it arrived, General von Cramon reported at noon on June 7: Lieutenant General Metzger, the head of the operations department at the Austro-Hungarian army command, was of the opinion \"that with Austrian troops \u2014 even those available from the Southwest Front \u2014 the situation at Auf can be restored.\" Further reports from Generaloberst von Linsingen clarified the completely diminished resistance of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army; their troops had retreated so far without compelling reason that the counterattack intended from Riwne was no longer feasible. Quick German assistance seemed necessary. General von Falkenhayn ordered the dispatch of the 108th Infantry Division from the area of the Commander-in-Chief East and the X Army Corps from his previously held back Western reserves to Kowel. In the communication about this to Generaloberst von Conrad, he emphasized that he assumed it was self-evident that all somehow dispensable Austro-Hungarian units would be transported to the threatened front using the railways to the fullest extent. At the same time, he asked the allied Chief of Staff for a discussion in Berlin on June 8.\nGeneraloberst von Conrad had initially considered prompting General von Falkenhayn to abandon the Verdun offensive, whose progress seemed minimal to him anyway. German troops were to settle the situation against Russia, while the Austro-Hungarians continued the fight against Italy. With this aim, Lieutenant General Metzger also made the aforementioned communication to Lieutenant General von Cramon. The reminder that the Austro-Hungarian army had taken responsibility for holding the Eastern Front beyond the Pripet, and indeed holding it with their own troops as long as the Russians did not regroup their forces, seemed to have faded with Generaloberst von Conrad and his staff. When by the evening of June 7 the situation at the front became increasingly threatening, it became clear to the Austro-Hungarian Chief of Staff that his plans would not prevail in the discussion in Berlin, but rather the situation would be discussed to abandon the Tyrolean offensive.

The necessity to restore the situation seemed as urgent to him with the 5th and 7th Armies due to the proximity of Romania as with the 4th Army. He considered a counterattack with far-reaching goals. On one hand, the Russians were to be dealt an \"active\" blow that would offset their current great success and thus eliminate the dangers it had \"caused (among Russia's allies, neutrals, Romania \u2014 ultimately in Serbia and Montenegro; in Russia itself)\". On the other hand, it was necessary to prevent Russia from once again taking possession of Eastern Galicia and Bukovina. Both were necessary \u2014 concluded Colonel General von Conrad \u2014 due to a \"repercussion on the great war decision, which we must primarily keep in mind and which currently reduces Italy to a secondary theater of war.\" Thus, he was now ready to draw troops from the Alpine front to Galicia. On the other hand, he wanted to request more divisions from General von Falkenhayn, which, however, should not roll to Kowel, but be at the free disposal of the Austro-Hungarian army command to Lemberg.\nGeneral von Falkenhayn had also meanwhile dealt with the question of now conducting a \"quick, energetic strike\" from Kowel in the east. However, during the discussion in Berlin, it no longer played a role. Besides the plans for the west, it was noted that the railway conditions behind the front at Kowel excluded the rapid deployment of strong troops.\nThe result of the discussion was summarized by General von Falkenhayn on the evening of June 8 in a telegram to Colonel General von Conrad, stating: \"There is no disagreement about the seriousness of the situation on the Galician front regarding both the tactical events and the operational ones and their repercussions for the entire course of the war. The situation is so serious that all available forces must be thrown to the threatened front. Naturally, Austria-Hungary is primarily obliged and also determined to postpone all offensive operations against Italy behind the defensive measures in Galicia.\" Therefore, the 61st Infantry Division had already been set in motion from Tyrol to Galicia, with strong heavy artillery and as soon as possible, additional infantry units would follow with the greatest acceleration.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 461 f.\n2) Remarks from June 9 on the result of the discussion transmitted by General von Falkenhayn.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>starke schwere Artillerie und baldm\u00f6glichst auch weitere Infanterieverb\u00e4nde w\u00fcrden ihr mit gr\u00f6\u00dfter Beschleunigung folgen.</fragment_2>", "048": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Das \u00f6.-u.

At the moment, such units are not available because the 2\u00bd divisions still standing in the second line are not considered for use in Galicia and other troops could only be withdrawn from the front in a few days, after a permanently sustainable line at the edge of the Asiago Plateau had been won. General von Falkenhayn then suggested that at least 2\u00bd divisions, relieved by the aforementioned, would be made available for Galicia. On the German side, forces in the strength of more than four divisions with very ample heavy artillery are being transported to the Linsingen army group. Whether a fifth division (11th Bavarian from the West) could still be sent or must go as a replacement for the 108th to the Hindenburg army group should be decided based on the situation upon their arrival in Warsaw.

Even without them, at least 7\u00bd divisions would still be needed for the assault group at Kowel. Meanwhile, General von Falkenhayn insisted that everything that could be brought out must be sent to the Linsingen army group. He requested heavy steep artillery batteries for the Western Front if they became available in Italy.\nMeanwhile, the disaster at the front in Galicia and Volhynia continued its course.

In view of the experiences at hand,\nthe Austro-Hungarian military leadership had serious reservations against\nthis \"extraordinarily bold plan\"), which initially had to tear a wide gap\nbetween the Austro-Hungarian 7th and the Southern Army.

Not east of Snjatyn, the line turned sharply north to the Dniester east of Horodenkta. In this area, it was only possible in the course of June 11, with great effort, to build a new, albeit very thinly occupied front. A single day had resulted in a loss of terrain of almost 30 kilometers in depth. But the front at Buczacz had also given way further on June 10. It now ran from the Dniester bend east of the Koropice mouth north to the previous right wing of the German Southern Army, which was still on the Strypa. At the request of General Count Bothmer, it had been extended due to the events of June 10 by transferring the right wing corps of the 7th Army (Austro-Hungarian VI Corps) to just north of the Monasterzyska\u2013Buczacz railway.\nIn view of the low resistance capability of the troops of the 7th Army, Generaloberst von Pflanzer deemed it necessary to withdraw his forces south of the Dniester to the same level as those north of the river. This meant further retreating about 30 kilometers. The report on this intention concluded: \"The possibility of stopping an attack currently does not exist at all. Such a decision would lead to the complete disintegration of the B\u00f6gen group.\" By the evening of June 12, weak forces had arrived as the right wing of the 7th Army to defend Bukovina from the Romanian border to Jablonitza behind the Pruth, with the main forces from there to Njezvritza on the Dniester. Thus, the army was on the same level as the Southern Army. However, their resistance was so low that Generaloberst von Pflanzer considered further retreat southwest to Delatyn, to take a flanking position against the Russian advance with the \"ruined army\" according to his already mentioned plan. However, the army command did not allow this.\nThe German Southern Army, reinforced by the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, had maintained its positions. However, serious danger threatened its right wing if the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army implemented its further retreat plans. At the request of General Count Bothmer, the Austro-Hungarian XIII Corps of the 7th Army was also subordinated to him on June 12. However, the danger was by no means eliminated, but only the unreliable junction between the two armies was once again shifted further south by a corps width. The Austro-Hungarian 7th Army had lost terrain on both sides of the Dniester, 90 kilometers wide and up to 60 kilometers deep, and had lost more than 50 percent of its strength.</body>\n<footer>1) Austrian official work, Volume IV, p. 449.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>hatte zu beiden Seiten des Dniestr auf 90 Kilometer Breite bis zu 60 Kilometer Tiefe an Gel\u00e4nde eingeb\u00fc\u00dft und dabei mehr als 50 vom Hundert ihres Bestandes verloren.</fragment_2>", "052": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Zwischen dem\".

Even if the enemy had only penetrated a narrow section of the front, the adjacent front sections often retreated without being seriously attacked themselves, simply because the connection was lost. Some higher commanders also made hasty retreat decisions, pointing out that holding the position with the shaken troops was not possible... The leadership saw the catastrophic collapse of the position as tearing apart the entire defense structure, and the troops were discouraged from fighting between the positions in open field battle\"). Without the insertion of new forces, the gaps created by such a failure could no longer be closed.\nIn the B\u00f6hm-Ermolli Army Group, the northern wing of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army had to be gradually bent back. Here too, there was a lack of forces to close the growing gap to the retreating Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. On the evening of June 12, the front of the 1st Army left the old position at Berezce, turning behind the Plaszewka and Lipa to Golatyn. In the large gap that followed, cavalry stood.\nThe development of the situation on June 9 had placed Generaloberst von Linsingen before the choice of either giving up the connection to the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army or the cohesion within the retreating Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. The attempt to stop this army in the face of the enemy seemed hopeless after the experiences made, unless the forces that had arrived so far for the counterattack, the Bernhardi Corps (Division Rusch and beginnings of the 108th and Austro-Hungarian 29th Infantry Division), were used. Generaloberst von Linsingen stuck to the decision not to do so. General von Bernhardi received the order to avoid larger battles in front of the Stochod to keep all three divisions in hand for the decisive strike. The Szurmay Corps and the Austro-Hungarian X Corps were ordered to take the direction towards Schowtetz when retreating on June 10; but this was not achieved. Attacked by the enemy in the morning, both corps retreated west instead of northwest. Thus, the front also tore within the army. Between the Austro-Hungarian X Corps and the Bernhardi Corps, a twelve-kilometer-wide gap emerged.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>s.-u. X.

X Corps and the Bernhardi Corps. General von Bernhardi, whose corps could only be ready for attack on June 14, withdrew the Rusch Division from Styr to Porepa before the advancing enemy. Generaloberst von Einem reported to the Supreme Army Command that of the 7\u00bd divisions that were overall planned for the counterattack after the Berlin meeting, so many would be needed just to support the front that only two to three divisions would remain for the assault group. He considered the bringing in of further reinforcements necessary. The next available unit for this was the Hungarian 61st Infantry Division rolling in from the Alpine front. General von Falkenhayn could not ignore the reasons of Generaloberst von Conrad, who deemed it indispensable on the left flank of the s.-u. 11th Army. On the evening of July 10, he agreed to this use, stating that the division would also be able to effectively participate in the counterattack from there. For the prospects of the Kowel attack group, it should be noted that the Russians could have at most eight active and four Landwehr divisions on the 150-kilometer arc from Kolki to Demidowka. This calculation roughly corresponded to the assumptions of the Linsingen Army Group, which counted on the Russian XXX, XXXIX, XXXX, XVIII Corps, four five-land rifle divisions, and some cavalry divisions there. General von Falkenhayn believed that an opportunity must be found to decisively tackle them at some point on the arc, even if only four to five divisions could be assembled for the assault itself. The prerequisite, of course, was to occupy individual areas sideways of the attack only very weakly and to lead the assault before the Russians could bring in further reinforcements. A serious threat from these was not to be feared, as they would likely be balanced out by the arrival of the X Army Corps and later additional forces, of which further news would follow. Generaloberst von Linsingen agreed with these statements but requested that General von Falkenhayn strongly advocate for the Hungarian 61st Infantry Division not to be integrated into the defensive front of the s.-u. 1st Army first, but to actually proceed with the attack. He had no doubt about its success; nevertheless, he considered the promised further reinforcements necessary for a decisive execution.\nThe command of the s.-u. 4th Army had meanwhile been taken over by Generaloberst von Terjitzansky. Since the enemy on June 11 pushed forward to the north, at Styr against Kopyle, it was possible to close the gap in the front again.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>nach Norden, am Styr gegen Kopyle, vorw\u00e4rtsdr\u00e4ngte, gelang es, die L\u00fccke in der Front wieder zu schlie\u00dfen.</fragment_2>", "054": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Das b.\u00f6.u.

Due to this \"purely frontal\" thrust, General\nv.

In them, it was stated\nthat the enemy would not continue the offensive to the west due to a lack of forces\nfor the time being. Initially, he seemed to be bringing up reinforcements, supplies,\nand ammunition.

For this, its subordination to the Linsingen Army Group was already being pursued by the German Supreme Army Command.\nIn connection with the impending attack, the relocation of the Linsingen High Command, at least its first echelon from Jablon, to the vicinity of the combat operations was necessary. General von Falkenhayn had already urged this and pointed out the great moral significance of such a measure with the words: \"One may even ask whether personal influence in such a critical situation is not the only thing from which success can be hoped. The wire may suffice for communication between staffs that are attuned to the same tone. It is not enough where deep-seated grievances exist.\" However, Generaloberst von Linsingen considered the time for forward relocation to be appropriate only with the start of the counterattack, as it was in no way foreseeable whether the front would not give way further by then and perhaps require another change. According to a record by Lieutenant Colonel Drechsel, then Chief of Staff of the X Army Corps, it was announced to his commanding general and him upon their arrival in Jablon on the evening of June 12: \"The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army is defeated and scattered. We do not know where its remnants are. At present, Kowel is not yet occupied by the Russians. However, it is very questionable whether the X Army Corps can still unload in Kowel. We expect further reports by morning.\"\nDuring this exchange of opinions between the highest German offices, the Austro-Hungarian Army Command authorized the 1st Army on June 12, if the Russians were to launch a strong attack before the start of the German counterattack, to withdraw their front to a prepared position on the Galician border. On the other hand, Generaloberst von Linsingen was forced by delays in the transport of reinforcements to postpone the start of the counterattack.\nOn June 14, new Russian attacks began against the Austro-Hungarian 4th and 1st Armies. The 1st Army, which was to come under the command of Generaloberst von Linsingen for the unified conduct of the counterattack on June 15, retreated with a loss of about 10,000 men, to join with the adjoining northern wing of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army to fall back to the line Lopuszno\u2014Radzimi\u0142\u0142ow\u2014Berestezczko.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 482 f. \u2014 2) Communication from August 14, 1934.\n3) Austrian official report, Volume IV, p. 471.\n4) Ibid., p. 491.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>auf die Linie Lopuszno\u2014Radzimi\u0142\u0142ow\u2014Berestezczko zur\u00fcckzugehen.</fragment_2>", "056": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Es fehlte an Kr\u00e4ften, den Erfolg bei Luck \u2014 wie es angesichts des v\u00f6lligen\".

For participation in the counterattack, only its extreme left wing seemed to be in question; these were the 61st Infantry Division and two Cavalry Divisions that had just arrived at Stojanow. The 4th Army, which despite its formation only had the management of a corps, no longer held its ground from the evening of June 15, about six kilometers west of Lokacze and Kisielin. Meanwhile, the X Army Corps had been unloaded enough that Generaloberst von Linsingen set the attack to begin on June 16; he had moved his headquarters to Kowel on June 14 for this purpose. He intended, as he reported to the Supreme Army Command on that day, to attack with the \"Marwitz Strike Group\" (four divisions) from the northwest, with the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army from the west, with the three Austro-Hungarian Cavalry Divisions and the Hungarian 61st Infantry Division from the southwest. In contrast, General von Falkenhayn, referring to his concerns expressed on June 12, suggested including the entire Austro-Hungarian 1st Army and the Austro-Hungarian II Corps in the attack front. Even if their pressure could only be weak, it would still be beneficial, as strong Russian forces were now advancing westward and would likely collide frontally with the attack of the Marwitz Group.

The only reserve, the 5th Siberian Corps, was still assembling at Olyka. Thus, the army command and army group had reservations about continuing the offensive beyond Luck. German troops were identified at Rozhyszcze1). Further advances westward exposed the flank to a potential counterattack by forces that could be deployed along the Kovel\u2014Maniewicze railway. Thus, General Brusilov instructed the 8th Army on June 8 to hold the center at the Styr from Sohl to Targowica. The flanks were to press north and south to initially collapse the adjacent enemy fronts. The strong army cavalry concentrated on the northern flank was again tasked with \"breaking through into the enemy's rear regardless of any advances.\" The 11th Army was to assist by attacking over Dubno. The 7th Army, which had successfully breached a broad front north of the Dniester the day before, and the 9th Army were to continue the attack, with the latter being reinforced if necessary by the 113th Infantry Division from Odessa to Proskurow.\nAttempts to expand the breach point of the 8th Army initially failed. However, the enemy's withdrawal naturally allowed for the advance, albeit of only weak forces, over Luck to the west.\nMeanwhile, it was clear that the main attack originally planned for June 10 or at the latest June 11, which the Western Front was to lead, would be delayed north of the Pripet. On June 3, a day before the start of the Southwestern Front's attack, the Supreme Army Command addressed General Ewcrt's concerns by agreeing to postpone his attack until June 13, or at the latest June 14. The next day, however, General Ewcrt requested further extensions; he wanted to conduct only a preliminary attack on June 13, with the main attack on the 17th. After initial refusal, the Supreme Army Command agreed. This increased the risk that the enemy would move troops from the area north of the Pripet southward and possibly strike the 8th Army's flank from the direction of Kovel. This could benefit the later main attack of the Western Front, but caution in continuing the offensive beyond Luck seemed advisable.</body>\n<footer>1) See p. 462.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "058": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \n\"Die Angriffsr\u00e4ume waren bereits vorher derart neu begrenzt worden, da\u00df die 8.

While the Western Front was still preparing for the decisive main attack, the Southwestern Front was given the primary task of \"cutting off the Austro-Hungarian army from the San and the retreat routes to the west.\" To do this, its right wing was to advance initially to the height of Luck, and then, securing against Kobryn\u2014Brest, take the direction southwest to Rawa Ruska (about 50 kilometers northwest of Lemberg). To support this advance, the southern wing of the Western Front was to take possession of Pinsk as soon as possible. The Northern Front was to conduct diversionary attacks and prepare the transport of another corps to the Southwestern Front. However, these orders initially had no consequences. The execution of the cavalry breakthrough on Kowel, repeatedly ordered by the 8th Army, was also omitted, as its futility might have been recognized by then. Essentially, only cavalry was advanced westward over Luck.\nOn June 10 and 11, the unexpectedly great success of the 9th Army south of the Dniester and simultaneously the 7th Army north of the river opened up new prospects. The right wing of the 11th Army had also begun to gain ground; it was extended northward and occupied Dubno on June 11. On June 13, at least a secondary attack was to be launched at Baranowicze on the Western Front. Thus, on June 12, General Brussilov issued instructions for the continuation of the offensive by his four armies with far-reaching goals. The attack areas had already been redefined in such a way that the 8th Army, to which the V Siberian Corps was assigned, transferred its two Siberian Corps to the 11th Army, which in turn transferred as many to the 7th Army, and the heavy artillery was also redistributed.

The 8th Army received the line Kowel\u2014Wladimir Wolynsk as attack targets, with its strong cavalry to secure against the north, while the southern adjoining armies were to hold a line averaging 30 kilometers ahead of the current front, running over Radziechow\u2014Brzezcany\u2014Stanislau\u2014Kolomea to Kuty.\nThese orders led to partial attacks on June 14, which brought local territorial gains. On the other hand, all four armies had strong reinforcements, without which further attacks promised no success. General Brusilov could not provide them. Meanwhile, the preliminary attack of the Western Front at Baranowicze on June 13 had ended in complete failure, and the attack at Pinsk was postponed to June 17, the day when the major main attack was also to begin, which the Western Front was still to lead. From the Southwestern Front, the 9th Army had turned south with two corps and begun to cross the Pruth. It was recognized that a counterattack threatened the 8th Army from the direction of Kowel. Five infantry and one cavalry division of newly arrived German and Austro-Hungarian reinforcements were identified, with three more infantry divisions to follow. General Brusilov had therefore already ordered the 8th Army on June 15 not to continue the offensive and to hold strong reserves behind the right wing. However, in the evening of the day, he issued an order for the regrouping of the army to attack Kowel at dawn on June 17, which was the next task to take possession of. In the direction of Wladimir, any forward movement of the infantry was to be halted.\nMeanwhile, the 11th Army had attacked over the Plaszewka and pursued the enemy retreating towards the Galician border.\nWhen the German and Austro-Hungarian counterattack began on June 16, the 4th Cavalry Corps, XXXVI Corps, 5th Cavalry Corps, and XXXX Corps held the Styr bend from Czartorysk in front of the 8th Army.

Full clarity about the course and strength of the enemy's deployment had not yet been gained, as everything was in constant motion. The lack of clarity of the area added to the difficulty. It was densely covered with larger and smaller forests and scattered individual farms, structured by many small elevations and showed height differences of up to 50 meters. Thunderstorms and heavy downpours that had fallen over the combat area in recent days had made the roads impassable. Softened clay soil and flooded swampy lowlands, numerous river and stream courses made the movements of the vehicles, which were also partially inadequately harnessed, difficult. Above all, the arrival of the heavy batteries and the ammunition columns, which were still considerably behind or not even unloaded, suffered from this. Nevertheless, Generaloberst von Linsingen believed he could not wait any longer and therefore adhered to the execution of the attack on June 16. Consideration of the urgent situation of the Fath Group and the arrival of Russian reinforcements had been decisive.\nThe thrust of the Marwitz Group with three battle-ready, rested German divisions in the front line was to bring the decision.

It was a heavy day of attack for Group Marwitz against a numerically superior, well-entrenched enemy who repeatedly tried to gain ground and left extraordinary numbers of dead. However, the 20th Infantry Division of the X Army Corps still failed to take the commanding Russian high position northwest of Kiiselin. Their mortars, which could not advance due to the softened ground, had meanwhile been assigned to Group Bernhardi. But even ammunition, especially heavy, was not sufficiently brought forward due to a lack of columns, which had not yet fully arrived, and impassable roads. Further north, the 108th Infantry Division achieved some successes. This secured the position on the right bank of the Stochod, but for the overall situation, only insignificant success was achieved. The spoils amounted to 4000 prisoners, 21 machine guns, and two cannons in three days of fighting. Meanwhile, the left wing of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army had even retreated several kilometers under Russian attacks near Gorochow. Four cavalry divisions, including the German 9th, were just enough to fill the gap from there to the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, which lay exhausted with its right wing at Lokatce. In the north, the situation in the Styr bend near Zartorysk caused the greatest concern.\nThe resilience of the Austro-Hungarian II Corps and the Fath Corps \u2014 as Generaloberst von Linsingen had already reported on the evening of June 17 in response to his request for reinforcements \u2014 was seriously declining due to continuous fighting and the daily increasing Russian pressure. On June 18, Generaloberst von Conrad replied: \"The main task remains to push through with the attack. In contrast, the defense of the endangered Styr bend is secondary.\" If the advancing 1st Bavarian Division was indispensable for the success of the attack, then further north, forces could be saved if necessary by occupying the Stochod position. Generaloberst von Linsingen had a different opinion. He passed on the decision with the addition of the Chief of the General Staff, that in this case, the Russian forces stationed at the lower Styr would immediately turn west, i.e., against Group Bernhardi. Troops for offensive use would therefore not be freed. \"The order to retreat has not been given by me; rather, the commanders between Stuhl and Kolki have been urged by me in the strongest terms to hold out.

With a ruthless offensive from three sides \u2014 he believed \u2014 it would be possible, after the arrival of the 43rd Reserve Division at the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army and the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division at the Bernhardi Group, to \"decisively defeat the enemy at one point\" and thereby at least restore the situation. The intention was to resume the attack in a planned manner after the reinforcements arrived on June 21.\nJune 19 brought the capture of the eight defended positions around Kisielin by the 20th Infantry Division under Lieutenant General von Sch\u00f6ler. The Russians suffered heavy losses. Otherwise, the day passed without significant changes on the front against Luck. As a result of the loss of Kisielin, the enemy seemed to be preparing to withdraw his parts advanced to the west, to strengthen the northern front of the Luck arc at the expense of the southern front, and to bring in more troops from the area north of the Pripet. Accordingly, reserves of the Eastern High Command had already been set in motion to the south, the 107th Infantry Division behind the endangered Styr arc to Maniewicze, the 5th Reserve Division initially behind the Gronau Army Group, where new Russian attacks were expected according to air reports. Furthermore, the Austro-Hungarian 48th Infantry Division, coming from the Italian front, was to move to the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army at Stojanow.\nAs the deployment against the southern front of the Russian incursion was delayed, the attack began on June 21 only in the west and north, but despite the deployment of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division, no progress was made. On the other hand, the enemy retreated before the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, where he had already withdrawn troops on June 18 and on the 19th, the burning of villages suggested intentions to retreat. The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army followed up to Zaturce and Swiniuchy.\nOn June 22, the immobile attack group on the left wing of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army under General of Cavalry Tugen von Falkenhayn (General Command of the XXII Reserve Corps) was also ready.

The success suffered under the difficulties of the terrain, particularly also because the German core troops brought in only gradually arrived due to extremely unfavorable railway conditions and were deployed in view of the low resistance capability of the Austro-Hungarian divisions before they were fully assembled. Since the combat strength of the Austro-Hungarian troops was completely insufficient to hold the parts of the enemy standing in front of their front, the Russians, far superior in total number, were able to relatively undisturbed shift their reserves to the positions threatened by German attack.

General von Falkenhayn had ensured that Generalmajor von Seeckt joined as \"Chief of General Staff.\" On June 15, advance troops of the enemy, who had swung south with three corps against Bukovina, attempted to cross the Pruth west of Czernowitz despite high water levels. In the evening of the day, Generalmajor von Seeckt assumed his new position as Chief of General Staff. In a report to Generaloberst von Conrad the following day, who primarily demanded heavy artillery, he expressed concern that the task of holding with main forces between Pruth and Dnjestr, and covering Bukovina with others, would tear the army apart as soon as the enemy launched a strong and well-prepared attack. This happened early on June 18. The Pruth defense collapsed, Czernowitz fell into Russian hands, and the group of General Edler von Korda (command of the Austro-Hungarian XI Corps) retreated southwards behind the Sereth. In the more than 70-kilometer-wide area between Sereth and Dnjestr, however, only cavalry and the remnants of the groups of Generals von Benigni and von Habsburg covered the direction towards Kolomea.\nAlready on June 19, the parts deployed at the Sereth continued to yield to Russian pressure. They stood in the evening at the Suczawa. Generaloberst von Conrad wanted to deploy two divisions rolling in from the Tyrolean front with the 7th Army. The foremost could reach the area of Kolomea\u2014Stanislau from June 26 onwards. Meanwhile, the retreat in Bukovina continued. Generalmajor von Seeckt requested, if at all possible, to promptly bring forward a fresh, complete mountain brigade from the rear against the Carpathian passes of Jacobeny and Kirlibaba, as the troops of the Korda group destined there would arrive in a state that required reception by fresh, rested troops. The request could not be met; the 7th Army had to help itself with an infantry brigade transferred from the Southern Army and individual battalions coming from the Balkans. However, the retreat of the Korda group continued relentlessly onward. By the evening of June 23, its right wing was already positioned between Kimpolung and Jacobeny, with other parts in disjointed groups advancing as far as west of Wiznitz.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>sam weiter.

Generaloberst von Linsingen reported that he had given the Austro-Hungarian \n4th Army the direction to retreat northwest, \nas its connection with the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army was in question; the retreat had already affected their northern wing. \nGeneraloberst von Conrad faced an extremely serious situation.

He considered \u2014 as he informed the German General \nStaff through General von Cramon \u2014 the situation so serious \nthat it no longer concerned only Austro-Hungarian interests but was \n\"decisive for the world war.\" The possibility that even the positions still held, especially in Bukovina, would have to be abandoned \nmade it more likely that Romania would yield to Russian pressure \nand join the Entente. He saw \"a decisive \nmeans\" to reshape the situation and dictate terms to the enemy again, \nonly in the fact that another thrust should be made with further German troops at a \ndifferent location than with the Linsingen Army Group. \nHe now wanted to draw all available forces from the Italian front for this purpose.

General von Falkenhayn did not agree to the Austro-Hungarian counterproposal. The Austro-Hungarian 7th South and 2nd Armies remained independent. On the other hand, Generaloberst von Conrad, under the crushing impression of the daily events at the front, especially the unbearable further retreat of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, agreed to the position demanded for Generalmajor von Seeckt at the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army as \"Chief of General Staff\" after repeated German insistence.\nMeanwhile, the Russian victory reports, which matched the reports from their own side, increasingly indicated the danger of a complete collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Eastern Front. The official Russian army report of June 11, which was available to the German Supreme Army Command early on June 12, already reported 106,000 prisoners, 124 guns, 180 machine guns, and 58 mortars as booty. At both breakthrough points, in Bukovina and near Luck, the German and Austro-Hungarian forces were in no way sufficient to help simultaneously. As the situation had developed, there was nothing left but to initially assign all available troops to the counterattack of Generaloberst Linsingen. Any doubts that had existed about this were resolved in these days. The German 105th Infantry Division, which was not expected until later, was also temporarily assigned to the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army. Furthermore, General von Falkenhayn deemed it necessary to secure even greater influence on the measures on the Austro-Hungarian front against Russia. For this, he considered Generalfeldmarschall von Mackensen, who had already led Austro-Hungarian armies in the summer and autumn of 1915 and at the Ballon</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "071": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Diesen Gegenvorschlag erkl\u00e4rte General von Falkenhayn f\u00fcr \u201eleider nicht annehmbar, da er keine ganze Ma\u00dfregel bedeute.

The communication concluded: \"I am certain that General von Conrad will be convinced that my proposals are guided only by factual considerations and unreserved trust in his understanding of my openness.\"\nGeneraloberst von Conrad saw in the proposal the effort to eliminate the Austro-Hungarian army command1). He replied on June 13: He would thereby \"take on commitments regarding tasks and the distribution of forces, not only within the Russian front, but also in relation to the other theaters of war, which would make it very difficult to account for the current situation on all fronts. The deployment of a once, albeit very proven leader, he did not consider decisive in the current situation against Russia. However, he considered it decisive that, in recognition of the urgent necessity to overcome the great crisis in the northeast now, the maximum possible number of troops from both sides be deployed for this purpose.\" Falkenhayn could be convinced that the utmost was being done from Teschen for this purpose. That with the deployment of German troops, the German leadership would also be granted a decisive influence on the operations was self-evident and certainly the case to a sufficient extent. He proposed the consolidation of the k.-u. 7th and the Southern Army under Generalfeldmarschall von Mackensen or also under Generaloberst von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli with Generalmajor von Seeckt as chief of staff, who could then be replaced by another German general staff officer at the \u00f6.-u. 7th Army.\nGeneral von Falkenhayn declared this counterproposal \"unfortunately unacceptable, as it did not mean a complete measure.

If that is not the case, then the recall of the Field Marshal from the Balkans is also not justified, for which Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria explicitly asked.\nRegarding the deployment of forces with the Linsingen Army Group and the necessity for it to remain in place to determine the timing of the counterattack based on its own knowledge of the situation, there was no disagreement between the two General Staff Chiefs. However, General von Falkenhayn later no longer considered the use of the 105th Infantry Division, initially intended for the 7th Army, appropriate when he learned how weak the internal cohesion of the Benigni and Hadfy groups of this army was. The division would not be able to stop the retreat but would likely be drawn into it. He proposed to assign it to the right wing of the Southern Army to assist with a counterattack from there. Generaloberst von Conrad, however, did not view the situation with the 7th Army as hopeless, considering the reinforcement of a Southern Army by one to two divisions as completely insufficient to conduct a counterattack. He wanted to assign not only the 105th but also the 48th Infantry Division, which was rolling in from the Italian front, to the 7th Army, but on June 15, after a sharply worded response from General von Falkenhayn, he agreed to the transfer of both divisions to the right wing of the Southern Army.

The success of the attack by the Russian Southwestern Front in Volhynia and Bukovina\nhas, in my opinion, led the Russian military leadership to the decision\nnot to launch an offensive against the German front, but to bring all\nstrong forces that can be spared there to the Southwestern Front, in order to\nexploit the previous success, to completely crush one of the two\nenemies, namely the weaker one.\"... This\nincreasing superiority on the Austrian front, thus over Eastern\nGalicia, because only after a complete victory over this front is the way clear\nfor achieving the main goal of the Entente: for the subjugation\nof Germany. If Your Excellency, like me, are convinced that\nthe Russians are about to seek the decision of the war south of the Pripet,\nthus in Eastern Galicia, then it is in our common\ninterest the compelling necessity to bring everything that is dispensable elsewhere\nto this war decision. Of course, I am\ndetermined to do this to the utmost extent. However, I must point out that\n300 battalions will face 620 battalions of the Italians, probably\nthe absolute minimum to prevent the latter from advancing into the interior\nof the monarchy, which would also have a decisive impact on the war.\nIn the Balkans, we have two weak Landsturm divisions,\nwith only a single mountain brigade as a \"powerful core\"). In the\nwar decision now sought by the Russians, I consider only a large\njoint action to be effective. This requires the concentration of the\nmaximum possible of our forces between the Brest-Litovsk\u2014\nRovno line and the Cam-Sniester line, to give the decision through a powerful offensive at\na suitable place.\"\nGeneral von Falkenhayn, who hoped for clarification of the situation through the\ncounterattack beginning on June 16 at Kovel\u00b3), replied provisionally: On the German side, \"everything that can be done at the moment has been done.\"</body>\n<footer>1) Information followed about new Russian formations in front of the Army Group Linsingen:\nIII., XXIV. and V.

If this prerequisite is not met, we will not be able to gain the time to prepare larger joint operations.\"\nOn June 17, the final answer followed: \"Your Excellency's view that only full harmony in military action can lead to success, I share all the more convinced, as I have always advocated it unreservedly and have vividly lamented any deviation from it.

However, there is no evidence for this yet. That is precisely the characteristic of the Russian success, that it was undoubtedly achieved with relatively weak and numerically inferior forces. As far as I know, the enemy has only a few divisions in transit from the north. Only the two divisions of the V Siberian Corps have been confirmed as arrived. In contrast, on our side, 7\u00bd infantry divisions with heavy artillery and a cavalry division, and on the Austro-Hungarian side, two infantry divisions have arrived or are in the process of unloading.

On the contrary, the setbacks on the left flank of the deeper Austro-Hungarian 1st Army even forced Colonel General von Conrad to assign the 48th Infantry Division, intended for the Southern Army, to that army instead. General von Falkenhayn had two divisions roll south from the front of the Supreme Commander East, where the situation seemed to be relaxing. On the other hand, the Austro-Hungarian military command of Army Group Archduke Eugen had given the order to halt the offensive against Italy on the evening of June 16 and requested two more divisions and heavy artillery, explicitly excluding three divisions consisting mainly of Czechs and Ruthenians as not eligible.

However, he still had to reserve the use of the two divisions from Tyrol. He also had to ensure secure defense there in the common interest, otherwise Italy could quickly force a campaign decision through success in the southwest of the monarchy. However, he could only request the extraordinary measure of transferring the supreme command between Dniester and Pripet to Field Marshal von Mackensen from his emperor if \"further significant German reinforcements, i.e., a German army, were brought in for the decisive battle against the Russian southwestern front.\" He requested an immediate response on this.\nThe counter-demand provoked a sharp response from General von Falkenhayn. He emphasized: Since such strong German forces were deployed on the Austro-Hungarian front, his wishes must also be taken into account when deploying the two Tyrolean divisions, as he generally had to ask to be \"involved in all major operational decisions.\" This was necessary due to the responsibility incumbent upon him. He could not agree that conditions would be attached to the transfer of command to Field Marshal von Mackensen. Rather, the situation was the opposite. Already, 8\u00bd German infantry and one cavalry division with strong heavy artillery were \"as a core troop on the Austro-Hungarian front, thus a strong German army,\" and two more infantry divisions were on the way. He could not release more forces at this moment; whether in a few days, only the future could tell.\nColonel General von Conrad was very affected and not willing to \"engage in this tone\"). Only through the mediation of Major General von Cramon was communication maintained in the following days. Further actions of the k.u.k. 7th Army prompted him to finally assign the two divisions coming from Tyrol to this army2).\nHowever, General von Falkenhayn raised an objection on June 21 through Major General von Cramon: \"I ask you to leave no one in doubt there that I consider all diversions of troops from the place where the decision lies, namely the area of Luck, to be a grave mistake.\"\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>einen schweren Fehler halte.</fragment_2>", "078": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Eine Besprechung in Berlin sollte die schwebenden Fragen kl\u00e4ren.\" This is a complete sentence with a clear ending punctuation (a period), indicating it is not a fragment.\n\n<fragment_1>Eine Besprechung in Berlin sollte die schwebenden Fragen kl\u00e4ren.</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"Am 23.

If the thrust at Luck succeeds or at least pushes the Russians back over the Styr, we can easily form a new attack group that, advancing over Tarnopol to the southeast, must quickly put an end to the Russian specter in Bukovina. However, if it is not possible to strike a blow at Luck that paralyzes the enemy there, then even the two divisions allegedly intended for General von Pflanzer will not be able to permanently hold the fate in the area south of the Dniester.\"\n\"Reliable sources\" in Teschen reported telegrams from the Italian representatives in Petersburg and Bucharest to their government indicating the greatest deployment of forces by Russia and Italy against Austria-Hungary, perhaps also suggesting that Romania's intervention was imminent.\nColonel General von Conrad, who had previously avoided any interference in the leadership of the German-influenced units, namely the Linsingen Army Group and the South and Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, responded to the German Chief of Staff in a conciliatory tone: He was always ready for an exchange of views and sincerely thanked for the suggestion, which he fully agreed with. He also believed that the decision now lay at Luck and everything had to be united there. However, since the two Tyrolean divisions would arrive too late, the first at best on the 28th, there was still time to decide about them; above all, he again proposed the deployment of stronger German forces against the Russian southwestern front, where the campaign decision undoubtedly lay. He recommended, continuing the attack of the Linsingen Army Group, the attack of \"strong German and Austro-Hungarian forces\" on both sides of the Dniester. But when General von Falkenhayn inquired which fresh and strong Austro-Hungarian forces would be available for this attack, he had to admit on June 22 that he did not have such forces at his disposal for the time being, but could bring in 3 divisions from Italy at the beginning of July. Unfortunately, he was not in a position to simultaneously prepare attack forces on the Dniester, reliably hold the Carpathian passes from Bukovina to Hungary, and the Italian front.\nEverything therefore depended on the extent to which German forces could be made available.

On the way there, Colonel General von Conrad considered the various operational possibilities in the area of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army: an attack between the Pruth and Dniester or on both sides of the Dniester, with the pressure mainly on the area south of the river, or finally from the area of the Southern Army from Podhajce. For this, the following could be brought in: to the 7th Army daily 55 trains or to the Southern Army on three railways daily 75 trains or simultaneously to the 7th Army 35, to the Southern Army 60, a total of 95 trains. During the discussion, Colonel General von Conrad stated that he, including the troops already dispatched, could withdraw at most five to six divisions from the front against Italy, which meant no more than had already been envisaged. General von Falkenhayn expressed that he too had already gone to the limit of what was possible with the reinforcements transferred, unless troop movements of the enemy further relieved the German part of the Eastern Front. From this, it followed that a \"decisive-seeking operation\" was impossible. It could only be a matter of holding the front and conducting an attack with a limited objective in southeastern Galicia. But even that was not immediately feasible, but only after the cessation of the attack by Army Group Linsingen. So the only option left was to carry out this attack, as General von Falkenhayn had already wanted, also with a limited objective to the end and then to begin the attack to relieve the 7th Army. The idea of supporting the attack by Army Group Linsingen with a thrust by the Southern Army from the area west of Tarnopol to the northeast also had to be abandoned, as the preparation would have taken too much time. To at least alleviate the most urgent need at the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, General von Falkenhayn was now, however, in agreement that the two Tyrolean divisions were transferred to it.\nThe result of the discussion led General von Falkenhayn to state, among other things: \"Every possible means will be used to strengthen the Imperial and Royal troops on the Eastern Front and to infuse them with reinforcements. Apart from the moral effects on leaders and men, this requires ample supply of replacements, heavy artillery, and ammunition ... According to the current situation, it is intended to carry out the attack by Army Group Linsingen as far as possible until the Russians are finally brought to a standstill there and we consequently form a new defensive position with strong parts from the army group.\"</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>nehmen k\u00f6nnen.</fragment_2>", "080": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \n\"Der Gegenangriff in Italiener steht unmittelbar bevor, von seinem Verlauf werden meine weiteren Ma\u00dfnahmen abh\u00e4ngen.

Already now, all otherwise dispensable heavy artillery, which is to participate in the attack, should be brought in and the establishment of food and ammunition depots should be undertaken.

On the other hand, the German Supreme Army Command will, if further Russian reinforcements are undertaken on the front south of the Pripet, naturally use any forces that become available from the Hindenburg and Prince Leopold army groups for the operations planned in Galicia.\nColonel General von Conrad agreed with this summary except for the following: \"From the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, which holds 50 kilometers of front in direct attack direction on Lemberg with four divisions, hardly any forces can be freed for the attack. Our attack area will still have to be determined depending on the development of the situation. This could also be arranged so that the connections of the Russian Bukovina Group are effectively hit by an attack between the Dniester and Pruth and east of the Dniester. The shortening of our Italian front is in progress. The counterattack in Italy is imminent, and my further measures will depend on its course.

Yielding to the pressure of the Supreme Army Command, General Ewcrt had his 3rd Army attack at Baranowicze for the relief of the Southwest Front as early as June 13. In doing so, the Grenadier Corps lost 8,000 men but achieved no success\u00b2). The other forces held ready for the operation, including the newly formed \"Polish Rifle Brigade\"\u00b3), were not deployed at all. On June 15, General Ewcrt reported to the Supreme Army Command that everything was ready for the main attack to begin on June 17. However, the enemy positions in front of Vilna were extraordinarily strong. Since the successes of the 8th Army offered prospects of advancing quickly to Kovel and Vladimir, while the 3rd Army could take Pinsk, it was to be considered whether to abandon the attack on Vilna altogether and instead attack with strong forces at Baranowicze, to force the enemy to evacuate the position in front of Vilna by threatening the Lida\u2014Grodno front. In four, or at most three weeks, the two to three corps needed at Baranowicze could be made ready.\nOn June 15, General Brusilov also outlined the difficulties for the Southwest Front arising from the fact that the attack of the Western Front had been repeatedly postponed. His troops did not understand why they were attacking alone while the main forces were positioned north of the Pripet. The enemy had already brought up troops in the north and could bring more. The own offensive would be stalled unless relieved by a swift attack from the Western Front. Nevertheless, the Supreme Army Command agreed to the Western Front's plans aimed at further postponement. It seems to have been decisive that the overwhelming number of German reinforcements reported in front of the 8th Army did not come from the Eastern Front north of the Pripet, but from the front in France.\n</body>\n<footer>\n\u00b9) Continuation on p. 472.\n\u00b2) p. 517.\n\u00b3) p. 430.\n</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Verst\u00e4rkungen nicht von der Ostfront n\u00f6rdlich des Pripjet, sondern von der Front in Frankreich kam.</fragment_2>", "082": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"General Brussilow sah sich vom 20.

Therefore, no significant relief for the southwestern front was expected from the attack in the north in the future. The Russian troops north of the Pripjet seemed bound by the threatening preparations for an attack there. The Russian Supreme Command postponed the main attack, now led at Baranowicze, to no later than early July (the dates fluctuated between June 29 and July 3), aiming for the greatest possible coordination with the attack planned by the Western powers on the Somme at the same time. Italy was also urged to launch a new attack, as \"the moment of a decisive success against Austria in this war could be accelerated by a vigorous attack on two fronts\"\u00b9). Efforts were also increased to finally gain Romania's active participation.\nThe attack of the western front at Pinsk was to be coordinated with the further attack of the southwestern front. It was postponed indefinitely when their 8th Army was pushed into defense by the counterattack of the Central Powers on June 16. This counterattack, on the other hand, prompted General Brussilov to urge the Supreme Command to accelerate the attack of the western front. At the same time, he demanded ample supplies of ammunition, as the stubborn battles that had now begun consumed entire quantities compared to the previous rapid advances. Without ample ammunition \u2014 as emphasized by the commander-in-chief of the southwestern front \u2014 the situation could become untenable and all gains could be lost. However, the overall ammunition situation of the Russian army was not such that the Supreme Command could provide sustainable assistance. Instead, on June 19, they transferred the two corps of the western front (I and I Turkestan Corps) previously designated for the attack at Pinsk to the southwestern front.\nMeanwhile, the attack of strong German forces from Kowel became increasingly noticeable. General Kaledin, the leader of the Russian 8th Army, demanded further strong reserves. His confidence in further attack success had diminished since he knew German groups were his opponents\u00b2). On the other hand, the consumption of ammunition by infantry and artillery continued to rise; the supply was no longer sufficient.

To what extent it was possible to replace the\nloss is not known. However, it is certain that the replacement troops were\nconsiderably less well-prepared for their task than those they had to replace.\nThe intended attacks by the Russian Western and Southwestern Fronts\nfor the early days of July, coinciding with the Somme Offensive of the\nWestern powers, did not occur. This was because new attacks by the Central\nPowers had already hit the Southwestern Front. Their infantry divisions\nwere distributed at this time as follows:\n3rd Army 5 divisions and 1 en route\n8th - 17 -\n11th - 8\u00bd - 2 -\n9th - 12 - 1 -\n9th - 10 - 1 -\nb) Conclusion of the attack by the Linsingen Army Group*),\nJune 24 to July 18.\nMap 7, Sketches 25, 26, 27.\nGeneraloberst von Linsingen was determined to continue the attack,\nbut was also clear that without the deployment of strong new forces,\nnothing decisive could be achieved.

On the\nGerman side, on June 24, the 107th Infantry Division*) moved into the\nfront next to the 11th Bavarian. With both, General von Bernhardi was\nto resume the attack on the east bank of the Styr the next day, to also\nassist the Rusche Division in advancing and to push the enemy back to\nRozyszcze. However, the often swampy and wooded terrain in this area\nseemed unsuitable for continuing the attack.

To this end, a new attack group was to be formed under the deployment of the advancing 22nd Infantry Division\u00b9) and the 108th Infantry Division, marching from the left wing of the X Army Corps under General von der Marwitz. The Austro-Hungarian military command promised heavy artillery for their divisions involved in the new attack (7th of the 1st Army and 48th). However, they could not grant the requested reinforcements beyond that. Similarly, the German supreme military command rejected the request for another corps, which had been demanded in view of the news of the arrival of the Russian I Corps at Luzk. Reinforcements could only be taken from the Eastern Front due to the tense situation in the West, and even here only as far as the enemy moved north of the Pripet. However, since he could appear correspondingly stronger south of the Pripet in this case, a decisive change in the balance of power was hardly to be expected in the future. Nevertheless, the army group hoped, as General von Stolzmann reported on the telephone to the supreme military command, to advance more quickly after the imminent arrival of heavy artillery\u00b2).\nOn June 25, the attack by the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division under Lieutenant General von Kneussl and the 107th Infantry Division under Major General Handorff brought gratifying, but only local successes, which could only be slightly expanded in the following days with the participation of the Ruschc Division. However, the enemy seems to have suffered quite heavily, losing 1000 prisoners\u00b3). The V Siberian Corps, which had only been deployed here since June 14, was replaced by the I Corps, as it turned out in the following days. However, intercepted radio messages from Rowno already indicated another Russian corps, the I Turkestan, was on the move, and the results of aerial reconnaissance left no doubt that the enemy was bringing strong forces from the north and also from the south to Volhynia.\nOn June 30, the attack of the new Marwitz group was to begin. For this, the Austro-Hungarian 7th Infantry Division, the 22nd, 108th, and Austro-Hungarian 48th Infantry Division were prepared as the main assault group between the mouth of the Lipa into the Styr and the line Zwininacz\u2014Ugrynow. On the left, the assault group of General Eugen von Falkenhayn joined with the cavalry corps of Field Marshal Lieutenant Freiherr von Leonhardi, the Hungarian 61st Infantry Division, as well as the German 43rd Reserve and 9th Cavalry Division.\n</body>\n<footer>\n\u00b9) See p. 518.\n\u00b2) From the west, one i.

The attack direction of both assault groups aimed at Luck. The left wing of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army and all parts encompassing the breach points from Luck in the west and north up to and including the Bernhardi Group were to participate in the attack. Colonel General von Linsingen hoped that the thrust of the Marwitz Group would surprise and decisively hit the relatively weak enemy in front of them. Careful preparation of the attack, thought out in all details, and the fire of a total of around 250 guns, about 40 of them heavy, were to ensure success.\nThunderstorms and pouring rain, which had already hindered troop movements on June 29, also impaired the course of the attack this time. The early deployed, powerful 22nd Infantry Division under Lieutenant General Dieffenbach encountered stubborn resistance north of Solotyn. The 108th Infantry Division under Lieutenant General Bedmann advanced better to the left of it, and the Austro-Hungarian 48th Infantry Division also gained some ground. However, the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Infantry Division, which had advanced to the Sty, and the adjoining left wing of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, as well as the entire Falkenhayn assault group, were denied any major success. The X Army Corps and the Bernhardi Group made smaller local advances. Thus, the overall result of June 30 was not satisfactory. On July 1, the enemy gave way before the 22nd Austro-Hungarian 7th Infantry Division. The main assault group had thus gained an average of three kilometers of terrain from the starting position. On July 2, it was able to make another leap forward, which brought about five kilometers of terrain gain for the center. The booty rose to about 3000 prisoners. But then, on July 3, Russian counterattacks began, while their own striking power had exhausted itself.\nMeanwhile, the situation on the northern wing of the army group had critically intensified. Flyers had reported lively train traffic on the route leading from Sarny on June 28. Since then, the main focus was directed at the Styr bend from Sarny. On June 30, the beginning deployment of the I Turkestan Corps was recognized southeast of Kolki. Colonel General von Linsingen has requested the deployment of the 5th Reserve Division, provided by the Supreme Commander East behind the army group Prince Leopold at Baranowicze. The Supreme Army Command, however, rejected this request because heavy Russian drumfire also here announced an imminent serious attack.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>leitung aber lehnte das ab, weil heftiges russisches Trommelfeuer auch hier einen unmittelbar bevorstehenden ernsten Angriff ank\u00fcndigte1).</fragment_2>", "087": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"am 3.

At the same time, the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army at Brody, where the railway and road to Lviv cross the border, also expected an attack. The Linsingen Army Group found itself almost entirely on the defensive despite all reinforcements, as the enemy had brought in about the same number of new troops, and the deployed Austro-Hungarian units had partly melted away alarmingly quickly. The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, numbering only 20,000 men (five divisions), had a daily loss of about 1,000 men; the Austro-Hungarian 7th Infantry Division reported a loss of 4,000 men during the attack on June 30, which could not be fully replenished. Thus, Generaloberst von Linsingen ordered the expansion of permanent positions on July 3; only the attack of the Marwitz Group was to be continued after new preparations.\nThen, on July 4, the expected Russian attack against the protruding Styr Bend from Czartorysk broke out. On the morning of the day, from the railway north of Perepisa to the area of Jezierz, a bow measuring about 100 kilometers, there were a total of one German and about six Austro-Hungarian infantry and two cavalry divisions. Of these, the center and left wing of the Bernhardi Corps (107th Infantry Division and eastward adjoining Austro-Hungarian II Corps) as well as the Fath Corps up to the railway to Czarny had the front facing south, north of which lay the left wing of the latter and the right of the Hauer Cavalry Corps (Polish Legion and two cavalry divisions) with the front facing east. In several places on the south side and along the entire east side of the bow, the enemy was already on the left bank of the Styr. It was assumed, quite accurately, that there were about ten infantry and five cavalry divisions, thus almost twice as many. Its preparatory fire seemed strongest on the extreme left wing of the Fath Corps west of Rafalowka. Generaloberst von Linsingen nevertheless expected the main attack against the southern front, especially against Kolki. As a reserve, he had the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division of the Bernhardi Group withdrawn from the front and assembled behind the 107th Infantry Division. Further forces to intercept the attack or to prepare a counterattack were prohibited by the demand of the supreme army command on July 3 for the deployment of a reinforced brigade of the X Army Corps to support the Heeresgruppe Prinz Leopold, which was already engaged in heavy defensive fighting at Baranowicze.</body>\n<footer>1) See more on p. 520 f.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>inzwischen bereits in schwerem Abwehrkampfe liegenden Heeresgruppe Prinz Leopold\u00b9).</fragment_2>", "088": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Sie sollte k\u00fcnftig unter m\u00f6glicher Festhaltung des bisher siegreich\".

At this junction, the enemy broke almost ten kilometers deep.\nColonel General von Linsingen ordered the 11th Bavarian Infantry\nDivision, reinforced by local reserves, to counterattack on July 5\nat 10 a.m. Meanwhile, both flanks of the Fath Corps had\nfurther yielded. The deployment of the Bavarian troops\nand their readiness were delayed by oppressive heat, so that\ninitially only makeshift support of the front at the breach\nnorth of Kolki was possible.\nColonel General von Linsingen now wanted to lead the counterattack in the\ndirection of Gruziatyn\u2014Kolki and set it for July 7;\nthe 2nd Combat Squadron (six squadrons with 36 aircraft),\nwhich had meanwhile been brought in at the request of the Army Group from the Supreme Army\nCommand, was to participate by attacking Russian troop landings and advances.\nHe also achieved the retention of the already prepared for transport\n37th Infantry Brigade of the X Army Corps, which was to be moved to\nManiewicze. In a telephone conversation with General\nvon Falkenhayn, Major General von Stoltzmann expressed hope\nthat the situation on the right and later also on the left flank of the Fath Group\ncould be restored, but he also considered \"given the unreliability\nof the troops\" the possibility that eventually the entire\nFath and Sauer Groups would have to be withdrawn behind the Stochod.\nThis situation occurred sooner than expected when the Russians resumed\nthe attack against both flanks of the Fath Corps with great emphasis at noon on July 6.\nThe foremost parts of the 37th Infantry Brigade, as they came from the railway,\ntried in vain to hold the front east of Maniewicze;\na light field howitzer battery fell into enemy hands.\nWhen the enemy also broke into the previously held second position north of Kolki\nand thus threatened to cut off the protruding bend\nfrom Czartorysk, Colonel General von Linsingen issued the initial orders for retreat\nto the prepared position behind the Stochod at 6 p.m.\nOn the morning of July 7, the front left Gruziatyn\nnorthwards to the originally held position south of Jezierzce.\nIt was to be held in the future with as much firmness as possible of the previously successfully defended and well-developed Styr section Sokal\u2014Gruziatyn, seeking connection to the Stochod bend northwest of Gruziatyn and then drawing north on the left bank of the river.\n</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) G. 520 f.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>behaupteten und gut ausgebauten Styr-Abschnittes Sokal\u2014Gruziatyn Anschluss an das Stochod-Knie nordwestlich von Gruziatyn suchen und sich dann auf dem linken Flu\u00dfufer nach Norden ziehen.</fragment_2>", "089": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"\u201eBei der dreifachen \u00dcberlegenheit des Gegners bleibt es nicht sicher, ob an Stellen, wo die wenigen deutschen Truppen\".

In the telephone conversation on July 7, Major General von Stoltzmann also stated that the army group could hardly spare any forces even with this shortening of the front, as its strength lay, as he had to report repeatedly, solely in the few German divisions. \"The others are partly no longer to be counted at all, as they consist partly of at most 2000 men and constantly complain of exhaustion and combat incapacity.\" Following this discussion, Colonel General von Linsingen reported to Teschen on the evening of the same day: \"If extensive usable Austro-Hungarian reinforcements cannot be initiated in the shortest time, I must refuse responsibility for holding the Stochod line.\"\nThe retreating parts of the front, initially only the left wing of Group Bernhardi and Corps Fath, reached the general line Sokal\u2014Kaszowka\u2014Stochod course with the main forces during July 7. The attempt to have the cavalry corps Hauer, which had been less affected by the fighting, maintain the connection with the 82nd Reserve Division of the Army Group Gronau initially still east of the Stochod failed. Under the pressure of the Russian pursuit, the backward movement of the Austro-Hungarian cavalry accelerated to such an extent that by the evening of the day only one division stood as the northernmost wing of the army group on the bank of the river. Although the Army Detachment Woyrsch had already sent the dissolved Bavarian Cavalry Division to reinforce the Army Group Gronau, Colonel General von Linsingen considered the situation so serious in view of the hasty retreat of the Austro-Hungarian troops that he reported to the Supreme Army Command in the evening: \"With the enemy's threefold superiority, it remains uncertain whether at places where the few German troops are insufficient, further setbacks will not occur.\"</body>\n<footer>1) G. 522.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>nicht hinreichen, nicht noch weitere R\u00fcckschl\u00e4ge eintreten.</fragment_2>", "090": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Hinter der Front begannen an der Turja die 108.

The attack begun in the morning by five divisions (Austro-Hungarian 7th, German 22nd and 108th Infantry, as well as the newly inserted 43rd Reserve Division and Austro-Hungarian 48th Infantry Division) encountered stubborn resistance after minor local gains. Generaloberst von Linsingen decided to halt the attack here as well, to free up forces for the northern flank.\nOn July 8, General von der Marwitz withdrew his troops to the starting position and pulled out parts for withdrawal. Given the threatening situation for the entire Eastern Front, the Supreme Commander East offered a composite division under Lieutenant General Clausius (reinforced 175th Landwehr Infantry Brigade). The Supreme Army Command promised the 121st Infantry Division\u00b9). On the other hand, the difficulties caused by the retreat from the Styr for the southern flank of the Gronau army group led to sharp disputes with the Prince Leopold army group. However, the Supreme Army Command placed the defense at the junction of the two army groups back into one hand by allowing the Gronau army group to operationally withdraw to the Linsingen army group on July 9 for the current battles.\nMeanwhile, the entire front of the Bernhardi group had been withdrawn from its positions, gained in heavy attacks barely three weeks earlier, behind the Stochod. Until the railway line Porst\u2014Sitzowice was expanded, the far-advancing bend of Kalusowka was held. The Fath Corps was assigned to the Bernhardi group and reinforced with German troops. At Stobychwa, the Hauer cavalry corps joined, reinforced and strengthened by the 37th Infantry Brigade and the Bavarian Cavalry Division.

However, it was precisely this spot that the Russians chose for a new attack1).\nAt dawn on July 16, three divisions of the Russian 11th Army launched a surprise attack between Jagmow and Bludow after a short but intense artillery preparation. They overran the Hungarian 61st Infantry and parts of the 7th Cavalry Division so completely that they retreated eight kilometers southwest in one move; 16 kilometers behind the front, in Gorochow, retreating batteries were stopped. The enemy mainly spared the east against the front of the Austro-Hungarian 48th Infantry Division and largely caused its collapse. In contrast, the Austro-Hungarian 7th Infantry Division repelled an attack led by weaker forces on the right flank of the group. The intervening German divisions were hardly affected. However, the enemy had torn a hole ten kilometers wide and deep in the direction of Swiniacze. Since he did not push further, it was possible to establish at least a weak defensive line against him using three German recruit battalions located behind the front. The Hungarian 61st Infantry Division reported a strength of only 300 rifles. Under such conditions, even a counterattack prepared by the commander of the 43rd Reserve Division, Major General von Rundel, promised no lasting success. General von der Marwitz requested and received permission to withdraw his group behind the Lipa and the Swiniacze-Putimoty line. The movement had to be carried out on the night of July 17, without being disturbed by the enemy. Heavy losses were again recorded. The Russian army report reported 13,000 prisoners and 30 guns.\nThe events prompted Colonel General von Linsingen to send a detailed report to the Supreme Army Command, in which he sharply complained about the failure of Austro-Hungarian troops, insofar as they were not interspersed with Germans. He had visited leaders and troops who had recently retreated in honor and had seen sad pictures in their positions. Colonel General von Conrad was very accommodating in requests for the removal of incapable elements, but there were conditions against which every leader was powerless. Therefore, he could not take responsibility for the fact that the 350-kilometer-long front was held as German troops advanced. He regretted having to express this, but he now had so much evidence of the inadequate resistance of the allies that he could rely solely on the German troops, who had achieved remarkable feats in attack and defense for six weeks.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) G. 539.\n2) G. 514.\n</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>bedauere, das aussprechen zu m\u00fcssen, habe aber nunmehr soviel Beweise von unzureichender Widerstandskraft der Verb\u00fcndeten, da\u00df er sich nur ganz allein auf die deutschen Truppen verlassen k\u00f6nne, die seit sechs Wochen Erstaunliches im Angriff wie in der Verteidigung geleistet h\u00e4tten.</fragment_2>", "093": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Der Gedanke, von Haus aus wesentlich st\u00e4rkere Truppen an die ge- gef\u00e4hrdete Front zu fahren und damit den Schwerpunkt der Kriegsf\u00fchrung wieder nach dem Osten zu verlegen, ist von Generaloberst von Conrad begeisterischerweise mit Nachdruck vertreten worden, mu\u00dfte aber von General\".

The progress achieved southwest\nand west of Luck was at least offset by the loss\nof the Szczytoryz arc. The reasons for the unsatisfactory overall result\nlay in the nature of the combat conditions.\nThe idea of deploying significantly stronger troops from home to the\nthreatened front and thus shifting the focus of the war effort\nback to the east was enthusiastically advocated by Generaloberst von Conrad,\nbut had to be opposed by General von Falkenhayn in view of the overall war situation.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>von Falkenhayn angesichts der Gesamtkriegslage abgelehnt werden').</fragment_2>", "094": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \n\"Auch der Gegner hatte das erkannt und verwendete seine Truppen entsprechend.\"\n\nThis sentence appears complete, ending with a period, indicating it is not a fragment.\n\n<fragment_1>Auch der Gegner hatte das erkannt und verwendete seine Truppen entsprechend.</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is:\n\"Als der Oberbefehlshaber Ost am 7.

Bringing strong forces to simultaneous, coordinated action on the Austro-Hungarian Eastern Front would only have been possible if the dispensable reinforcements had been brought to effect faster than the Russians brought theirs. However, this was mainly not possible because the railways leading to the combat area could not handle significantly more than they actually could bear. A unified attack would only have been possible after a longer wait and corresponding withdrawal of the front against an opponent who had also been reinforced in the meantime. Meanwhile, there was a fear that the combat strength of the allied troops would hopelessly collapse.\nColonel General von Linsingen decided to deploy the reinforcements, which were only gradually arriving, in succession. He found the approval of both army commands in this. However, General von Falkenhayn rightly expressed concerns about the initial approach of the Marwitz attack group'), as this approach led in the least operationally effective direction. However, he eventually conceded to the counterarguments put forward by Colonel General von Linsingen as a connoisseur of local conditions. These were based on an accurate assessment of the current situation. When the attack began a few days later, the enemy had already partially changed their plans*).\nIt is therefore quite possible that an attack in the operationally effective direction over Solki\u2014Kosti into the rear of Luck would have actually brought greater successes than the frontal attack from the west. At the very least, the endangered position of the Fath group would have been secured.\nThe disappointing attack results of the Marwitz shock group on June 16 and the following days were partly due to the already mentioned difficulties of the terrain, partly to the unexpected strength of the enemy resistance. After ten days of costly advances, the Russian troops still proved capable of intercepting the assault of fresh German shock divisions to such an extent that they could only gradually work their way forward kilometer by kilometer in close combat. The enthusiasm for the results of the simultaneous and all later attack attempts, which were undertaken by less fresh divisions at other points of the breakthrough front, was even lower. It was further exacerbated by the fact that the attack strength of the Austro-Hungarian divisions was extremely low. The enemy also recognized this and used their troops accordingly.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 316 ff. \u2014 2) p. 467 and 469. \u2014 3) p. 494.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "095": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Bei der \u00f6.-u. 7.

After the initial attacks by the Linsingen Army Group had not brought any decisive success and the time-consuming regroupings took place, I would have considered the temporary transition to the defensive as correct,\" because then it would have been possible to withdraw at least two divisions from the front and support the Fath Group, whose threat had been apparent for eight to ten days. Generaloberst von Conrad also raised the accusation with the Supreme Army Command two days later that the Fath and Hauer Corps had been exposed to failure \"without compelling reason,\" perhaps referring to his suggestion on June 18 under different circumstances to withdraw these corps.\nIt is worth highlighting the ever-renewing confidence that inspired the Linsingen Army Group Command despite all disappointments. As a result, even if it overshot the target, it facilitated the task for both army commands and also strengthened the confidence in success among the subordinate troops. However, whether the measures taken first to eliminate, then to stem the enemy's breakthrough and to support their own front always represented the best solution, seemed doubtful.\nc) New setbacks on the southern flank of the Austro-Hungarian front and formation of the Archduke Karl Army Group.

The Austrian 44th and, following it, the Austro-Hungarian 59th Infantry Division were in transport to the army.\nGeneral von Falkenhayn was also convinced of the overwhelming importance of the situation on the Austro-Hungarian southern flank, since his hope for further significant offensive successes of the Linsingen army group was dwindling. All strength was to be concentrated to restore the situation with the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army as soon as possible, but the Russian incursion at Luck was only to be contained. While the Linsingen army group also had only one infantry and one cavalry division and, if the attack penetrated to the Styr, another infantry division available, General von Falkenhayn considered the deployment of six infantry and two cavalry divisions possible, as on a 75-kilometer-long front from the Lipa estuary to Sohul, 15 infantry and four cavalry divisions were deployed. Meanwhile, on June 25, he assigned two German divisions to the southern army, which were just now freed by the relaxation of the situation with the Commander-in-Chief East, the 119th Infantry and 1st Reserve Division. Clear signs of an imminent resumption of the Russian offensive against the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army east of Kolomea and worrying news from Bucharest, however, led to a regiment of the 105th Infantry Division rolling in from the Balkans being sent as a reserve to Kolomea on the same day, and the next day the 119th Infantry Division was also assigned there. Five heavy batteries were set in motion from the west. Even the transfer of the 1st Reserve Division to the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army was considered and only abandoned again due to the heavy occupation of the railways south of the Dniester as impracticable.\nMeanwhile, on the southern flank of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, the retreat of Group Korda on June 26 came to a halt in the almost pathless forested Carpathians, which rise up to 2000 meters, already forward of Jablonow and Kirlibaba. The main force of the army was with the cavalry-formed southern flank on the northern slope of the mountains as well as at Wiznitz and Kuty. From there, the positions over Jablonow were abandoned northward to the Dniester, where they joined those of the southern army north of Niezviska.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>nach Norden zum Dnjestr, wo sie n\u00f6rdlich von Niezviska an die der S\u00fcdarmee anschlossen.</fragment_2>", "097": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Das gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig aus beiderseitigen\".

This approximately 80-kilometer-long front was occupied by only five a) Austrian-Hungarian infantry divisions and four cavalry divisions, all significantly weakened in combat strength. An attack by 4\u00bd Russian corps was expected against them. When it began with full force on June 28 and quickly gained ground, especially south of the Pruth, the army command was concerned that the troops would achieve nothing in defending against the numerically superior enemy, but would lose their last combat strength and thus be unavailable for the planned counteroffensive. They intended to retreat further if necessary. Both army commands agreed, provided the connection to the Southern Army remained intact. Thus, the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army was withdrawn by June 30 to a line running from Czeremosz south of Zabie, west past Kolomea to the area south of Tlumacz.\nFor the counteroffensive, General von Falkenhayn suggested on June 27 the formation of a special \"Dniester Army Group,\" consisting of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, a newly formed 12th Army from German and Austrian-Hungarian units (especially the German 105th and 119th Infantry and 1st Reserve Division), and the Southern Army. Since Field Marshal von Mackensen was indispensable on the Balkan due to Romania's stance, he proposed the Austrian-Hungarian heir to the throne, the current commander of the Austro-Hungarian XX Corps against Italy, Lieutenant Field Marshal Archduke Karl Franz Josef, as the commander-in-chief of the 12th Army and simultaneously of the army group. He hoped that his election would spur the Austrian-Hungarian military leadership to achieve the greatest performances for this front section. Additionally, he noted in the instructions for Major General von Gramm that the \"otherwise unavoidable appointment of a German commander-in-chief might negatively affect the mood of influential Austrian-Hungarian circles. Major General von Seeckt was to assist the Archduke heir as chief of staff. The proposal met with reservations in Lejchen, as they did not want to place the heir to the throne in a task that might lead to failure.

The first directive agreed upon by both army commands placed the Austro-Hungarian 7th and the Southern Army under its command from July 4th and set the major goal of \"breaking through the enemy front in Eastern Galicia to open the way against the flank and rear connections of the enemy advancing through Bukovina.\" Further operational directives were to be issued to the army group, as with this first one, after prior consultation between the two general staff chiefs by the Austro-Hungarian army command.\nHowever, before the new army group command became active, the situation of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army forced the immediate deployment of the divisions intended for the future 12th Army, as the front west of Kolomea was again pressed on July 1st and retreated on both sides of the Pruth to the west, until it was \"caught\" west of Sadzawka by the meanwhile arrived, proven Austrian 44th Infantry Division. The army seemed to be breaking apart. The command of the Austro-Hungarian VIII Corps, arriving that day, which was to take command of the parts of the Benigni group standing south of the Pruth, found the troops there in such a state that the corps commander and his chief requested to be relieved of the command assigned to them. Thus, Field Marshal von Benigni continued to hold command there. In the evening of the day, the rest of the 105th Infantry Division was also made available to the army. It was to advance together with the 119th Infantry Division from the area of Tlumacz for a counterattack to the southeast on July 2nd, the Austrian 44th Infantry Division, reinforced by a third of the German 105th Infantry Division, simultaneously south of the Pruth to the east. These attacks, however, could only push the enemy back locally, although the thrust led by Lieutenant General von Kraewel with \u2154 of the 119th and \u2154 of the 105th Infantry Division surprisingly and from an effective direction had made good progress in the advance against Chojmura. In the south, the enemy pressed forward mainly over Kolomea. Austro-Hungarian cavalry, which here blocked the accesses to the Jablonica Pass and thus probably along the mountains, retreated towards the upper Pruth Valley. On July 3rd, renewed strong pressure from the enemy forced the deployment of the foremost parts of the just arriving Austro-Hungarian 59th Infantry Division to support the front.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "099": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Generaloberst von Pflanzer mit dem 7.

Thus, on the eve of the formation of the \"Army Group Archduke Karl,\" the units designated for its 12th Army were already fully committed. The strong Russian pressure prevented the planned mass formation for a counterattack at the Dniester. At the same time, however, the situation on the Western Front and against Italy was so tense that neither General von Falkenhayn nor Colonel General von Conrad could release additional forces for the time being.\nOn July 4, the front of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army seemed to stabilize; on the northern flank, the Kraewel Group, reinforced by Austro-Hungarian troops, even managed to gain some ground. However, on July 5, they were also pushed into defense, while the center of the army retreated again before new Russian assaults in the direction of Delatyn. On July 7, the front came to a halt along the Delatyn\u2014Chozimierz line, slightly north. At the Dniester, there was a connection to the now also pushed back right wing of the Southern Army. Without reinforcements, however, holding the current position was not guaranteed. The enemy reported 80,000 prisoners, 84 guns, and 272 machine guns, while the previous battles in the Kolomea area, which also saw a Russian loss of 70,000 men, were ongoing.\nIn the following days, concern arose over the enemy's pressure against the upper Pruth Valley near Delatyn, which he occupied on July 8, and near Tartarew; he obviously wanted to gain control of the road leading to the Jablonica Pass. On the other hand, since July 6, Colonel General von Pflanzer had been trying to influence the enemy through advances of his troops stationed in the Carpathians. This brought some partial success in the mountains but had no impact on the overall situation. More and more, the decision emerged to address the spatial separation of the two wing groups of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army by reorganizing command relationships. At the request of the Army Group Archduke Karl, it was ordered on July 15 that Colonel General von Pflanzer, with the 7th Army Command, should take over the southern group of his previous army (XI Corps, Cavalry Corps of the Field Marshal Lieutenant Ritter von Brudermann, the Austro-Hungarian 34th Infantry Division rolling in from Tyrol, and pass security in the Carpathians) and the border protection in Transylvania.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) p. 521.\n2) p. 513.\n3) Connection to p. 465 and 479 ff.\n</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Ritter von Brudermann, aus Tirol anrollende \u00f6.-u. 34.

It counted 13 battalions and eleven batteries (four of them heavy), which had been used as intervention troops at particularly threatened front positions as needed. In total, the eleven infantry divisions\u00b2) of the army seemed to face about twelve Russian ones by the end of June. On the northern wing, a local attack success achieved on July 1 at Worobijowka on the railway to Winniza contributed to stabilizing the situation. Further south, on the railway to Buczacz, the expected strong Russian attack began on July 4. It promisingly led to breaches in the front at Baran\u00f3w over a width of ten kilometers, which, however, could largely be balanced out by counterattacks. The following day, however, the front from the Dniester to north of the Monasterzyska-Buczacz railway gave way, so that the defense was withdrawn six kilometers into a prepared position behind the Koropiec during the night of July 6. To support this, parts of the 1st Reserve Division (twelve battalions, nine batteries) intended for the 12th Army, which had meanwhile arrived at Podhajce, had to be deployed. The Russian army report announced 10,000 prisoners as the result of the first two days of attack. The total loss amounted to about 13,000 men. Three infantry regiments of the Austro-Hungarian 39th Infantry Division together counted only 1,100 rifles.

New Russian attacks, directed on July 12 and 13 against the northern part of the front lying from Koropiec to Strypa, were repelled mainly by the 1st Reserve Division under Major General Sietlow. 1200 dead Russians remained here on the battlefield.

This was only possible by weakening the garrison on the 16-kilometer-long, north-facing Lipa front. Only the Austro-Hungarian 7th Infantry Division, which joined the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, now stood there. The overall position of this army thus formed a salient at the mouth of the Lipa; from here it ran behind the Styr and then, following the Galician eastern border, south to the railway east of Brody. This approximately 40-kilometer-long, naturally and by construction strong part of the position was occupied by only 2\u00bd divisions. When a new Russian attack seemed to be preparing against the Lipa corner on July 18, Generaloberst von Linsingen offered the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army the Austro-Hungarian 48th Infantry Division, which was in reserve with the Marwitz Group. Generaloberst von Puhallo declined the offer, believing he could manage with his own forces.

On this day, however, the enemy between Berestecko and the mouth of the Lipa already gained the west bank of the Styr with strong forces. The Austro-Hungarian 48th Infantry Division and further reinforcements arriving from the Marwitz Group came too late. The Austro-Hungarian 1st Army retreated on July 21 to the line Leszniow\u2013Galiczan on the Lipa, where the left wing south of Zwininacze maintained connection with the Marwitz Group. The Russian army report again reported 14,000 prisoners and ten guns as booty.\nMeanwhile, on July 22, the army group faced new concerns that Russian masses were also gathering in front of the northern wing of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army at Torczyn, and northeast of there, the presence of the commander-in-chief of the Russian Guards was detected by radio traffic in front of the Bernhardi Group at Rozyszcze. Aerial reports on rail traffic and strong troop assemblies clearly indicated that a new major attack was being prepared in the direction of Kowel. But also in front of the Gronau Group, the enemy suddenly gathered fresh forces south of Pinsk. \"One is constantly sitting on a powder keg\" \u2014 this is how the new chief of staff of the army group, Colonel Hoff, described the situation in a long-distance conversation with Major General von Cramon, although he initially did not even want to believe in the presence of the Russian Guards. He nevertheless considered an attack against the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army imminent. However, this army should \"for God's sake not be told anything beforehand,\" as unfortunately happened with the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army on the 19th and 20th. When on July 23, the Russian 1st and 3rd Guards Infantry Divisions were identified near the Rozyszcze\u2013Kowel railway by prisoners, there was no longer any doubt about the seriousness of the situation in this sector of the front. The German Supreme Army Command directed the 121st Infantry Division, which had initially been assigned to the Prince Leopold Army Group due to the fighting, further to Kowel; some Landsturm battalions arrived from Warsaw. Otherwise, the army group had to help itself.\nHowever, before new battles occurred with the Linsingen Army Group, the Russians overran the center of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army at Leszniow on the morning of July 25 and pushed it back to Bolduryn. The Galician border town of Brody was thus immediately threatened from the north. The army was divided; its northern wing (Austro-Hungarian 46th, \u00bd 33rd, and 48th Infantry Divisions), supported by troops of the German 22nd Infantry Division under their commander, Lieutenant General Dieffenbach, was subordinated to the Marwitz Group on July 26, while the southern wing joined the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) See p. 503 and 520 f.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>26.

On the other hand, it had already handed over a brigade to the Army Group Linsingen on June 6 and was, at the urging of the Supreme Army Command, despite all concerns, on June 12 about to let a second one follow, when the Russian attack began the next day, on June 13*).\nAgainst the positions north of Baranowicze, the Russian 3rd Army of the Western Front*) had prepared the Grenadier Corps (two divisions), with about 1\u00bd more divisions as a second echelon ready for attack. They were to break through the left flank of the German Landwehr Corps north of the railway to Slonim, which bordered the s.u. XII Corps just south of Lake Kolodtschewo, and then bring down Baranowicze itself from the north. After extensive artillery preparation, the Russian grenadiers launched a dense mass assault in the evening of the day. They hit the northern half of the 4th Landwehr Division of Lieutenant General von Brieske and the extreme right flank of the s.u. 16th Infantry Division, but broke in the defensive fire of Silesian Landwehr, which was effectively supported by artillery and Austro-Hungarian troops. Weak repetitions of the attack on June 14 also ended unsuccessfully. The Russian loss amounted to 8000 men.\nThe Russian attack prompted the Supreme Commander East to deploy the 22nd Infantry Division, which had been withdrawn as a reserve, to the Army Detachment Woyrsch.</body>\n<footer>* Overview of the contributions p. 564 f.\n*) Details are contained in Volume 9 of the \"Battles of the World War\".\n*) p. 494.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Abteilung Woyrsch abzuf\u00f6rdern.</fragment_2>", "105": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Ob und wie sp\u00e4ter gegen die Bukowina verfahren\".

On June 16, he was asked by the Supreme Army Command to express his opinion on the situation: Since the planned Russian offensive against the German part of the Eastern Front had been abandoned according to Austro-Hungarian opinion, the question arose whether a relief of the front south of the Pripet might also be possible through an offensive from his command area; from the west, however, hardly any significant forces could be freed. In the response, the Commander-in-Chief East emphasized that the forces of the enemy shifted south had been taken from sections where an attack was not expected anyway. There were no reliable reports that the Guards or forces from the presumed attack focus near Smorgon had been withdrawn. The enemy had 480 battalions between Berezyna and Lake Narocz against 140 German ones. Thus, even after the withdrawal of some Russian corps, there remained such an enemy superiority that any removal of German forces was risky. For an own offensive, only the direction towards Riga would be possible with only a slight reinforcement; however, this would be of little help to the Austro-Hungarian army. This effect could probably only be achieved by an attack from the southern flank, which would not be possible without a very strong reinforcement. If it were confirmed that the Russians shifted the focus of their operations to the Austro-Hungarian front, then it would be more correct to deploy the forces thus freed from the German front immediately to support allies. Reports of weakening of the enemy in front of their own front changed the perception of the Commander-in-Chief East in the following days. He began to view the situation of the Austro-Hungarian front as very serious. When General von Falkenhayn inquired on June 19 what he could give up, he also assumed that the enemy had abandoned the \"intended major offensive\" against his front. He offered the 107th Infantry Division and the 5th Reserve Division, already prepared as a reserve of the Supreme Army Command, and two days later also the 22nd Infantry Division. However, he also noted how maturely he could assess his own front, emphasizing the overall situation. General von Falkenhayn complied with this request on June 21, stating\u00b9): The decision still lay in the West. In the East, one must adapt. This primarily includes bringing the Austro-Hungarian front to a standstill again, initially at Luck. Whether and how to proceed later against Bukovina is not yet foreseeable, but it is clear that \"serious days are ahead of us.\"</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>werden solle, lasse sich noch nicht \u00fcbersehen, wohl aber, da\u00df \u201euns noch ernste Tage bevorstehen\u201c.</fragment_2>", "106": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"zwischen Berezyna und Narocz-See schien nach wie vor ein Angriff bevor-\".

The 5th Reserve Division was held there, and on June 23, the Commander-in-Chief East initiated the transport of the 119th Infantry Division, which had been prepared behind his southern flank, to Army Group Prince Leopold, whose command area was extended on the same day by assigning the Army Group Gronau to extend south beyond the Pripjet.\nIn the meantime, the counterattack of Army Group Linsingen had not brought the hoped-for success. However, the Austro-Hungarian military leadership claimed to know from a \"secret and very reliable source\" that the Russians were determined to direct their total effort against Austria and only to occupy the German front. Thus, on June 24, General von Falkenhayn asked the Commander-in-Chief East whether he still adhered to the procedure of strengthening the allied front by shifting troops, and if so, what forces he could still spare. The Commander-in-Chief East replied the next day: Sufficient forces were not available for the offensive he himself desired in the direction of Riga, even if it were possible to free up one or two divisions for it. He was therefore still of the opinion that only the support of the armies standing further south could be considered with the available forces. As the situation at Baranowicze seemed to relax according to his assessment, he now offered the 119th Infantry Division and another division to be withdrawn from the front for transfer to the allies. He would probably not be able to free up more, and even these two divisions could only be equipped with limited heavy artillery. When on June 25 the 1st Reserve Division was also ready for transfer, he reported: \"With this, I have reached the end of my forces and must be able to count on support if necessary.\" He requested assurance for this before he finally handed over the division, and he received it, as the enemy's intentions were still not entirely clear. The Russian Guards were still observed on June 26 as before in front of the 10th Army's front; between Berezyna and Narocz Lake, an attack still seemed imminent.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>zusehen.</fragment_2>", "107": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Beim Landwehrkorps unter General der Kavallerie Freiherrn von K\u00f6nig wurde er von den beiden\".

The next day, after \nintense drumfire, the expected Russian attacks began \nagainst various positions of the 12th and 10th Armies, most strongly on both sides \nof Smorgon itself.

At the Austro-Hungarian XII Corps under General of Infantry von Henriques, this was not successful everywhere. At Strobdowa, the front was dented. The resistance strength of the corps, especially the Austro-Hungarian 16th Infantry Division, seems to have suffered so much that Generaloberst von Woyrsch considered replacement by German troops urgent. Parts of the 5th Reserve Division, made available by the army group, were inserted into the front. At Erd\u00f6bben, the second position was held over about four kilometers. The seriousness of the situation was clearly expressed by Generaloberst von Woyrsch through his Chief of Staff, Colonel Heye, on the evening of July 3, when he requested reinforcements by telephone from General von Falkenhayn. He could only promise the 201st Infantry Division, which was just being formed. His response confirmed the previous statements of Colonel Heye: \"His Majesty is convinced that in the army group every man knows that it is now a matter of the war decision on all fronts, where the use of the last drop of blood is required from everyone.\" Moreover, General von Falkenhayn could only refer the army group to the Commander-in-Chief East, who, despite the fighting on his own front, already extracted what he could make available1), initially the Bavarian Cavalry Division and some smaller parts, to which he now added heavy batteries.\nJuly 4 brought new Russian assaults. At Darowo, where the enemy broke into the position of the 3rd Landwehr Division of Major General Adams, it was possible to restore the situation by the next morning. At the Austro-Hungarian XII Corps, into which German troops had meanwhile been integrated in divisional strength, there was heavy fighting, but the Russian assault was eventually largely intercepted. In the following days, the enemy renewed his attacks with increasing intensity and with the deployment of new troops, but without any significant success. On July 9, 14 Russian divisions were already identified on a 50-kilometer-wide battlefront in the front line. Their attacks subsided, but were still in preparation. Meanwhile, the retreat of the northern wing of the Linsingen army group behind the Stoch\u00f3d complicated the overall situation. In agreement with the Commander-in-Chief East, the Bavarian Cavalry Division was assigned to support the front of the southern wing of the Gronau army group, with which it crossed over to the Linsingen army group on July 9.</body>\n<footer>1) \"The camaraderie of the armies of the East was famous.

The attack of the enemy breaking out on July 1 in the west at the Somme, on July 3 on the German Eastern Front at Baranowicze, and then also at Smorgon, as well as the concern about a new major Italian offensive, let every hope vanish of bringing significant fresh forces from any of these theaters of war to Galicia and Volhynia in the foreseeable future and providing the newly organized Army Group Command Archduke Karl\u00b3) with an attack-capable army.

Since early July, this idea played a role in diplomatic exchanges between Berlin and Vienna).\nGeneral von Falkenhayn could no longer evade the considerations and admonitions addressed to him. On July 3, he proposed, albeit reluctantly, to the Kaiser that Field Marshal von Hindenburg be appointed as the supreme commander over the entire Eastern Front. Major General von Cramon was to clarify the position of the Austro-Hungarian army leadership through a \"very personal and confidential inquiry.\" The Prince Leopold Army Group was instructed to immediately contact the Eastern Supreme Commander regarding the reinforcements it requested. Thus, even before the final regulation of command relationships, he gained influence beyond his own power area on the distribution and use of the German Eastern forces and also assumed some co-responsibility for the section of the Prince Leopold Army Group.\nThe inquiry transmitted to Colonel General von Conrad envisaged the operational command of Field Marshal von Hindenburg from Bukovina to the Baltic Sea, with certain restrictions for the Austro-Hungarian part of the front as previously considered for Field Marshal von Mackensen). The advantages of such a regulation \u2014 so concluded the order for Major General von Cramon \u2014 were as evident as the downsides. On July 3, his response arrived: \"Excellency von Conrad believes that the benefits of the proposed measure will not be proportionate to the disadvantages. In the monarchy, the exclusion of the supreme commander Archduke Friedrich, which it would ultimately amount to, would not be understood, but rather seen as an admission of complete impotence to continue the operations themselves. It would also create the impression among our enemies that the Imperial and Royal Army was at the end of its strength and could only be inspired by the name of Field Marshal Hindenburg, meaning that the Central Powers would now play their remaining trump card.\" A closer contact between the two supreme army commands through daily communication via telegraph was, however, very desirable.\nAt the same time, as Colonel General von Conrad rejected the proposal \"as General von Falkenhayn soon expressed it himself \u2014 with good reasons,\" Lieutenant General Ludendorff, prompted by the events in the Styr bend of Czartorysk and their impact on the front north of the Pripjet amidst simultaneous heavy attacks against the Prince Leopold Army Group, had Secretary of State Helfferich tell the Chancellor on July 4: \"The lack of command unity exceeds the level of responsibility that can still be borne in this dangerous situation.\"\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>veranla\u00dft durch die Ereignisse im Styr-Bogen von Czartorysk und ihre R\u00fcckwirkung auf die Front n\u00f6rdlich des Pripjet bei gleichzeitigen schweren Angriffen gegen die Heeresgruppe Prinz Leopold, dem Reichskanzler am 4.

However, on July 7th, Field Marshal von Hindenburg addressed an urgent warning to him: \"At the risk of being misunderstood, I feel it is my duty to express that the current critical situation in the East can perhaps only be resolved if the entire front from Courland to Bukovina is placed under unified command, which must be granted full independence and reserves must be supplied.\" This step prompted General von Falkenhayn, in an immediate response to Field Marshal von Hindenburg, to outline the difficulties opposing the desired command regulation. It would only be conceivable to subordinate the front from the Baltic Sea to and including the army group Linsingen to the Commander-in-Chief East. Subsequently, he initially proposed a dual subordination, under the German Supreme Army Command for the German part of his future front, under the Austro-Hungarian for the army group Linsingen. He was in agreement with the thoughts of leading Viennese circles and also the Austro-Hungarian Supreme Commander, Archduke Friedrich3). However, General von Falkenhayn declared such dual subordination \"completely impossible,\" as it would \"eliminate\" the Emperor's influence in \"matters of life and death for the army and thus the empire.\" He wanted to leave no doubt that the German commander on the Eastern Front should only be subordinate to the Emperor and thus the German Supreme Army Command, and that his communication with the Austro-Hungarian army command should go through the German one. This view was now also agreed upon by the Commander-in-Chief East.\nColonel General von Conrad also rejected the new proposal on July 9th \"for factual-military reasons,\" as a division of the Austro-Hungarian front, attacked uniformly and with superiority by the Russians, would only increase the difficulties, as the boundary of the command areas would fall precisely into the main thrust direction of the Russians, Dubno-Brody-Lemberg.</body>\n<footer>1) Chancellor to Envoy von Treutler on July 4th. \u2014 2) The record of General Mar.

Only the bringing in of the forces necessary according to the existing strength ratios could help, particularly to the southern flank.\nIn a similar sense, the day before, the Commander-in-Chief East had also urged the swift provision of a \"truly combat-ready\" division for the army groups Prince Leopold and Linsingen, but also of troops for the Austro-Hungarian southern flank. General von Falkenhayn was not in a position to meet such demands at the time. He wanted to try to achieve the subordination of the Linsingen army group under the Commander-in-Chief East in the next few days through verbal discussion. Until then, the subordination of the Prince Leopold army group under the Commander-in-Chief East should also be postponed, with which he fully agreed.\nThe personal discussion of the two chiefs of staff was delayed.

The closest connection and destruction of German and Austro-Hungarian troops and the corresponding strengthening of German influence were more urgent than ever. Calls for unified German command over the entire Eastern Front also came from Bulgaria). Even influential circles in Vienna seemed no longer opposed to such command by Field Marshal von Hindenburg. On July 16, the Chancellor offered his support to diplomatically support the German demand.

He was justifiably concerned about the situation at the Dniester, the endangerment of Hungary, and the attitude of Romania. He needed more German troops for the offensive of Army Group Archduke Karl, after the divisions designated for this had mostly already been deployed for other tasks. Lieutenant General Ludendorff and the Minister of War, Lieutenant General von Wild, were present at the meeting, but whether throughout its entire duration is not known. Generaloberst von Conrad remained opposed to the supreme command issue. At the Austro-Hungarian front against Russia, there were 135,000 Germans, 422,000 Austrians and Hungarians, a total of 557,000 men against about 800,000 Russians. Without significant German reinforcements, which could not be provided, changes in command relationships seemed worthless to him. The name \"Hindenburg\" alone would hardly impress the Austro-Hungarian troops, but they would feel the German patronage oppressive. On the other hand, Generaloberst von Conrad wanted to \"absolutely comply with German suggestions and wishes.\"\nFollowing the question of command regulation, \"measures to remedy the further dissolution\" of the Austro-Hungarian army were discussed, for which Generaloberst von Linsingen, in addition to his report of July 16) and Major General von Seeckt, among others, had proposed: Personal contact and influence of the army commands by the army leadership; Generaloberst von Conrad must visit them himself once. The corps commanders should be personally held responsible for ensuring that the exaggerated fear of the Russians and reluctance to continue the fight with all force, which appeared in many places, were suppressed.

In his opinion, the situation \"could possibly only be maintained by Hindenburg himself.\" This urging and the realization that there was no hope for the consent of Generaloberst von Conrad, but probably for that of Emperor Franz Josef, led to the idea of resolving the entire issue through direct agreement between the two rulers\u00b2). However, this could result in the removal of Generaloberst von Conrad or his voluntary resignation. General von Cramon reported on July 22 to the Supreme Army Command: He was \"after further careful consideration, after consultation with the military attach\u00e9, Lieutenant Colonel Count von Kageneck, and discreetly gathered inquiries, convinced that the benefit achievable with the departure of Generaloberst von Conrad would not be proportionate to the potential adverse consequences that could arise from a shake in confidence in the army and possibly also in the hinterland.\" On the other hand, he believed that placing the entire Eastern Front under the command of Olt would be welcomed not only in military circles but also by the people. If it were possible to find a form that would ensure the prestige of the Austro-Hungarian army leadership, ensuring that no serious decisions were made without their consent, and that above all the interests of Austria-Hungary were not harmed, General von Cramon believed that Emperor Franz Josef would have no objections\u00b3).\nImmediately after receiving this report, General von Falkenhayn called Lieutenant General Ludendorff on the telephone and now made him \"in view of the difficulties that had arisen and the impossibility of applying sharp pressure\" in Vienna, the completely new proposal to place all armies between the Dniester and Pripet, i.e., the Southern Army, Austro-Hungarian Army, and Linsingen Army Group, under Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg, who would thereby be subordinated to the Austro-Hungarian army leadership and his command on the German part of the Eastern Front. Nevertheless, \"the influence of the Generalfeldmarschall on the entire Eastern Front would remain secured, for which he (General von Falkenhayn) had already been prepared.\"</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>werde ...\u201c</fragment_2>", "118": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Generaloberst von Conrad war \u00fcberrascht und legte nochmals die Gr\u00fcnde dar, die \u00f6sterreichischerseits gegen diese\".

A negative stance from the Field Marshal followed: The solution meant a compromise for which he could not voluntarily take responsibility. However, General von Falkenhayn stuck to his plan. He communicated it to General Colonel von Conrad on July 23 and added that the Field Marshal had indeed rejected the voluntary acceptance of the proposed solution, but would naturally comply with a supreme command. \u201cI am ready to obtain this command.\u201d To resolve the command issue, the Kaiser would arrive in Ple\u00df on July 25 or 26 for two to three days.\nGeneral Colonel von Conrad saw in the proposal the intention to now place the \"weight of the decision\" on the front south of the Pripet. But General von Falkenhayn rejected this. His proposal was based rather \"solely on the intention to exploit the outstanding military strength of the Field Marshal and at the same time the aura surrounding his name for the great general cause, where it is undoubtedly most needed after the regrettable events of recent times.\" While General Colonel von Conrad was now obtaining the approval of Emperor Franz Josef, the new plan of General von Falkenhayn was already called into question by the fact that the Kaiser \u2014 as noted by the accompanying War Minister General von Stein on the journey to Ple\u00df \u2014 \"since Andrassy,\" emphasizing the impending collapse of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, had directly requested Hindenburg, considering the appointment of Hindenburg as leader of the Eastern Front as a demand of \"people's psychology\" and firmly supported this idea. So, on July 25, when the situation at the front had been severely exacerbated by a new Russian incursion at Brody, General von Falkenhayn again asked General Colonel von Conrad whether he still maintained, \"even now after the deterioration of the situation in Galicia,\" that the subordination of the entire Austro-Hungarian front under the Army Group Linsingen under the German Supreme Commander East was out of the question, and whether this also corresponded to the will of his Kaiser. General Colonel von Conrad affirmed both questions.\nOn the afternoon of July 26, General von Falkenhayn proposed in Teschen the subordination of the entire front under Field Marshal von Hindenburg.

On the one hand, it took into account the prestige of the Austro-Hungarian military command, which continued to have complete autonomy over the army group Archduke Karl, the Italian front, and the front in Albania; on the other hand, it secured support for it through the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief East up to the area of Lemberg with troops from the area north of the Dniester at any time. The command area of Field Marshal von Hindenburg and thus his influence on the overall conduct of the war was expanded to such an extent as corresponded to the views of the German people and the wishes of the Chancellor.

The 5th and 2nd Armies should be assigned not only a German liaison officer but also a German First General Staff officer. The training of the troops should be enhanced by participation in joint courses, the construction of positions, and the use of artillery should be promoted by assigning German artillery staffs, based on the experiences made in the Western battles. The often excessively large infantry strength of Austro-Hungarian divisions in relation to the number of guns was to be balanced by allocations to German units more richly equipped with artillery. On the other hand, reinforcement of those divisions by German artillery was envisaged. The possibility of increasing the rather low level of artillery material in the Austro-Hungarian units was examined. Gas protection measures and barbed wire, the latter also for the Army Group Archduke Karl, were supplied. The need to assign increased replacements to numerically weak regiments could mostly not be met due to ethnic and language difficulties.\nThe overall situation on the Eastern Front had further intensified in the days of reorganization.\nIn the Army Group Archduke Karl\u00b9), the intention to attack had not yet been completely abandoned, but initially, on July 28, a rather serious new Russian incursion occurred on both sides of the Dniester, to which German troops had succumbed. Further attacks seemed to be in preparation.\nAt the front of the Commander-in-Chief East, the Russian attack against the Linsingen Army Group followed the incursion at Brody\u00b2) on July 28. The fighting continued here. New assaults were expected at Brody as well as against the Army Detachment Woyrsch and against the 8th Army before Riga. Whether it was possible to repel all Russian attacks on the now over 1000 kilometers long, only thinly occupied front depended primarily on the resilience of the deployed troops, as well as on timely recognition of the threatened points and appropriate use of the sparse reserves.\nThe Field Marshal had therefore already demanded reinforcements in Plesz on July 27, and General von Falkenhayn had then envisaged three divisions from the West. Of these, the 123rd Infantry Division, rolling towards Warsaw, was fought off\u00b3), and the 195th and 197th were to be formed from soon-to-arrive best troops in Siedlce and Lemberg.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>erst gebildet werden.</fragment_2>", "123": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \n\"Ich werde dann voraussichtlich in der Lage sein, Ende August erheblicher Kr\u00e4fte frei zu machen, also in einer Jahreszeit, wo ein aktives Kriegf\u00fchren l\u00e4ngs der Karpaten oder an anderer Stelle noch m\u00f6glich ist.\"\n\nThis sentence appears complete as it ends with a period and expresses a complete thought.

This meant a final renunciation of the main attack of the West Front, which in the future \u2014 as previously the North Front \u2014 was only to carry out subsidiary operations. The focus of the offensive was shifted to the northern wing of the Southwestern Front, which was now to lead the main thrust over Kowel into the rear of Pinsk. As a major operational goal, the Russian leadership aimed for a breakthrough at the seam between the German and the Austro-Hungarian part of the front. Additionally, it was important to involve Romania, with which negotiations were underway for a military convention\u2074).\nThe previous battles had cost the armies of the Southwestern Front heavy losses. From May 28 to July 13, they amounted to 498,000 men, of which 60,000 were missing. General Brussilov intended to resume the attack with the 3rd, 8th, and 11th Armies on July 14. At the same time, strong cavalry was to advance to expand the success already achieved at the Styr over the Stochod, where essentially only cavalry was opposing, towards Kamjens-Koszyrskij. Unexpected resistance at this river and reports from the 3rd and 8th Armies, which requested more time for their attack preparations, led to the postponement of their attack to July 20 to await the arrival of the guards. Under their commander, General of Cavalry Besobrasov, a \"Special Army\" was to be formed to deliver the decisive blow along the railway and road Boguszowka\u2014Kowel.\n</body>\n<footer>\n\u00b9) Connection to p. 494 ff.\n\u00b2) p. 520 ff.\n\u00b3) p. 500 ff.\n\u2074) p. 549.

When local reconnaissance revealed that in the attack area of the Special Army, the swampy terrain of the Stochod would cause great difficulties and necessitate a move south beyond Solotwina, General Brussilow decided not to launch a strong attack before Pinsk. The northern wing of the 3rd Army was to advance at Narischki over the Oginski Canal and further over the Jasiolda into the rear of Pinsk, with the army reinforced by two more corps coming from the Western Front (III Corps and IV Siberian Corps). This opened a pincer attack from north and south against the area Pinsk\u2014Kowel. The start of the attack was postponed to July 23. Meanwhile, the 11th Army under General Sacharow, reinforced by two more corps (V from the Western Front and V Siberian from the 8th Army), had already begun the counterattack against the Marwitz group north of the Lipa on July 16 and forced this group and the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army to retreat by July 21. In general, further operations were to attack only \"as far as possible\" in the direction of Brody; their task was fulfilled if they managed to tie down the enemy in front of their own front. The 7th and 9th Armies were to continue the offensive in the previous direction, thus with the main force along the Dniester towards Halicz and Stanislau.\nOn July 22, the day before the scheduled start of the attack, the Special Army designated for the main thrust requested a postponement. General Bessarow wanted to wait for the end of the prevailing rainy weather and the complete arrival of artillery ammunition and also wished to expand his attack section to the south. This resulted in another postponement of the start of the attack by five days to July 28. Meanwhile, the supreme command also sent the I Siberian Corps of the Western Front south as reinforcement to follow the Special Army as a reserve.\nThus, the Russian Southwestern Front was structured for the attack, starting from the right wing, as the adjacent overview illustrates.\nAs an introduction to the main attack, the 11th Army began on July 25 with the advance against the Austro-Hungarian positions north of Brody.

On the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, a new group under General Litzmann was formed from the 108th Infantry Division and the Szurmay Corps based on the experiences of the previous day. The 121st Infantry Division was inserted into the front of the L\u00fcttwitz Group, and the previously further north positioned 86th Infantry Division was brought up behind this obviously most threatened section. At the Bernhardi Army Group, heavy enemy attacks pushed back the Austro-Hungarian II Corps with serious losses on this day. General von Bernhardi was forced to order the repeatedly postponed withdrawal of the front into the Porst\u2014Sitowicze position. At the Fath Corps, Russian assaults on both sides of the railway were repelled, especially by parts of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division. Signs of attacks against the southern flank of the Gronau Army Group, where the enemy seemed to be preparing supply routes by water, increased and prompted the diversion of the 10th Landwehr Division, which had been assigned to the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army due to the threatening situation at Brody, to the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army from Brest to the east.\nOn July 30, the enemy extended his attacks further south to the Marwitz Army Group, but had no more success here than in the other front sections; at Zwininacze, he left about 2000 dead in front of the front. At the Bernhardi Group, he only slowly advanced against the new positions of the Austro-Hungarian II Corps. The heaviest fighting was at the Fath Corps, where the Russian 3rd Army was mainly at the railway and against Stobychwa strongly advancing.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Eisenbahn und gegen Stobychwa stark vorw\u00e4rtsdr\u00e4ngte.</fragment_2>", "132": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Als der Oberbefehlshaber Ost am 2.

However, final success eluded them. Generaloberst von Linsingen was able to express his full recognition to the Fath Corps, especially its 5th and 26th Infantry Divisions, for their stance in the crises of recent days. South of Newel and at the Ognitski Canal, the Russian III and IV Siberian Corps launched the expected attack against the Gronau Army Group. They were repelled at the Ognitski Canal, achieving nothing, with heavy losses. The 10th Landwehr Division, assigned to the army group in the hour of danger, was thus completely free for other use again.\nIn the previous attacks, the Russian I Guards Corps seemed to have been relatively little involved. It was opposite the Stochod section Solotwin\u2014Boguszowka. The army group therefore primarily anticipated the possibility of further advances at this point and distributed its reserves accordingly. The enemy had no success, but suffered heavy losses when he continued his attacks against the A\u00fcttwitz and Bernhardi groups on July 31. His strongest assault, however, only broke out on August 1 and was mainly directed against the 121st Infantry Division of the A\u00fcttwitz group, which, under Major General von Ditfurth, defended the Stochod section Witoshowka and northwards. They inflicted very heavy losses on the Russian Guards attacking six times here. On the same day, the Bernhardi group repelled all attacks by the Russian I Guards Corps. The situation was temporarily serious. The army group command directed all available forces to the attacked sections. Instructions were issued to the sub-commanders regulating behavior in the event of a Russian breakthrough. If an immediate counterattack by local reserves did not achieve the goal, the counterattack was to be conducted only after the introduction of new forces and thorough artillery preparation. The Commander-in-Chief East, who took command that day, was informed that further support was necessary if Kowel was to be held at all costs. Field Marshal von Hindenburg then had an infantry regiment along with artillery loaded in Brest as the first aid, which arrived at Lubitow on August 2. Further forces from the 75th Reserve Division were to follow. But the enemy remained quiet. His strength seemed exhausted. According to prisoner statements, new attacks were not expected until August 7.

In the war diary of the army group, the assessment of the situation on this day was simply the word \"Powder keg!\" However, the following days passed quietly. The main Russian attack was repelled, although its repetition was anticipated. The air forces, especially Bomber Wing 2, which dropped 42 tons of bombs on troop misplacements and unloading stations, contributed to the success.\nh) The Defensive Battles of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army and the Army Group Archduke Karl.\nSketch 32.\nColonel General von Boehm, the commander of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army\u00b9), considered the situation after the loss of Brody and the withdrawal of his right wing behind the Seret as extremely endangered. He feared succumbing to the pressure of the Russian 11th Army and considered Lemberg seriously threatened. He was only dissuaded from the plan to prepare the evacuation of the city by the intervention of the Austro-Hungarian military leadership. On August 4, the day after the visit of Field Marshal von Hindenburg in Lemberg, the enemy advanced along the Brody\u2014Lemberg railway against the left wing of the army, then shifted the focus of his attack to the right wing, where on August 5 he advanced with emphasis over the Seret and pushed the front westward. The connection to the Southern Army could still be maintained at the previous position for the time being. If it was lost, a serious threat also arose for the northern wing of the Army Group Archduke Karl. Meanwhile, the commander\u00b2) ensured that Colonel General von Boehm, who until now had available enemy-free German troops, initially reinforced the resistance force with an infantry regiment along with artillery, then the 197th and subsequently the beginning of the 195th Infantry Division were added\u00b3).

The intention to launch a counterattack at the Dniester, which had been the basis for its formation, had already been postponed indefinitely on July 23, when it became clear that the necessary German reinforcements would not be available due to the needs of other front sections. The 105th and 119th Infantry and the 1st Reserve Division had to be thrown into the defensive battle, the 121st Infantry Division was assigned to the Army Group Linsingen, and the 5th Reserve Division to the Army Group Prince Leopold. Also, the 10th Landwehr Division, freed in the north by the Austro-Hungarian 24th Infantry Division, was brought elsewhere. Thus, the Army Group of the Archduke, apart from German Landsturm battalions, which could not initially be deployed at the front due to their most inadequate armament and equipment, was only assigned a weak brigade of the Alpine Corps, which was expanded into a division, the \"Carpathian Corps\" (later the 200th Infantry Division). This mountain group was intended for the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, where it was necessary to prevent the enemy from breaking into Hungary over the Carpathians or making further progress in the immediate vicinity of the Romanian border.\nMeanwhile, on both sides of the Dniester, the Russian 7th and 9th Armies resumed the attack on July 28, simultaneously with the start of the major offensive against the Army Group Linsingen.

The attacks, which continued until August 2 and were conducted with great intensity, were repelled by the Austro-Hungarian XIII and VI Corps with the assistance of parts of the German 1st and 48th Reserve Divisions, except for minor breaches.\nSouth of the Dniester, the Russian 9th Army had meanwhile attacked the Krau\u00df and Draewel Group (119th and 105th Infantry Divisions) of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army with eight divisions on July 28 in the direction of Tlumacz and Ottynia. A deep breach in the former group quickly led the enemy so far into the right flank of the Krau\u00df Group that it had to urgently withdraw the southern wing of the 119th Infantry Division; four batteries covering this movement with their fire fell into enemy hands. By evening, the new deployment of the division on the right flank had already been deeply outflanked. In agreement with Generaloberst von Roehde, Generalleutnant von Kraewel withdrew his troops to Tlumacz on the night of July 29. The situation of the army, which had lost about 12,000 men and 19 guns, gave cause for serious concern. The front, stretched more than before, could only be very weakly manned, and ammunition was scarce. But the enemy also did not feel strong enough to continue the attack; he followed up to Tlumacz and Ottynia.\nMeanwhile, the Carpathian Corps under Generalleutnant von Conta had arrived at the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army. Since the enemy seemed to have weakened here, the army group hoped for success from an advance of the army and at the same time relief for its front north of the mountains. On August 2, the German Supreme Army Command planned further reinforcements for the Carpathians with the 1st Infantry Division\u00b9), which was already on its way to Maramaros Sziget. Even before their arrival, on August 3, the attack of the \"Conta Group,\" now reinforced by an Austro-Hungarian brigade, began against the Ludowa Ridge, which rises steeply 600 meters from the upper Czernemosz Valley, while at the same time the Hungarian 40th Infantry Division advanced further south against the Magura Heights. The enemy retreated from the Ludowa Ridge but took up a new defensive position on a mountain range ten kilometers further east; he was attacked and defeated there again on August 6. After minor further advances in the following two days, the arrival of Russian reinforcements and supply difficulties in the pathless mountain area caused a pause until the 1st Infantry Division, redirected to Kirlibaba, arrived. Further east, the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Cavalry Division was deployed at Talsobeny.

But already on August 4, he ordered its resumption for August 7. This time, the 3rd and Special Army were to attack Kowel concentrically, the 9th Army to advance on Nizniow\u2014Tlumacz.\nMeanwhile, prospects had also grown that Romania would soon enter the war. In accordance with its demands, the Russian Supreme Command prepared to send two infantry and one cavalry division to the Danube estuary to use them in Dobruja against the Bulgarians. The hope that difficulties would arise if the Russians were opponents\u00b2) played a role in this. At the same time, it was about forming a new focal point on the extreme left flank of the front against Austria-Hungary, to advance Romania by attacking over the Transylvanian Carpathians, which had demanded the capture of the line K\u00f6r\u00f6smez\u00f6\u2014Kirlibaba\u2014Dorna-Watra by the Russians as a precondition for its entry into the war. In contrast, the attack against Nizniow\u2014Tlumacz had to retreat if necessary. The southern wing of the 9th Army in the line Delatyn\u2014Kimpolung was to be reinforced by three infantry and one cavalry division, one of which was from the Western Front, the remaining parts from the 7th Army and the 9th itself.\nThe commander-in-chief of the 9th Army, General Letschitzki, however, did not make use of the permission to let his northern wing's attack on the Dniester fail. As planned, the Russians launched an attack on August 7 along the entire front between the Dniester and Pruth with nine infantry divisions. In the direction of Kowel, the start of the attack was postponed by one day.

The main thrust hit along the Dniester, overwhelming Group Kraewel, whose 105th Infantry Division was breached east of Tlumacz close to the river. Further south, the enemy penetrated deeply through the Austro-Hungarian formation northeast of Ottynia, thus also reaching the right flank and rear of the 119th Infantry Division. Surrounded from both sides, the southern wing and center of Group Kraewel had to retreat to Tysmienica with heavy losses\u00b9). Generaloberst von K\u00f6vess ordered the withdrawal of the entire army front to a line running from Nadworna east past Tysmienica to the Dniester, where there were virtually no defensive installations. When the enemy resumed their attacks with emphasis on August 8, they were again successful. The front had to be pulled back south behind the Bystrzyca-Nadwornia, while in the north, a bridgehead was held east of the Bystrzyca, from Stanislau to Maryampol on the Dniester.\nThis at least provisionally covered the right flank of the adjoining southern army. However, the deep penetration also affected their position, especially since their other flank was already endangered by previous events with the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army\u00b2). General Count Bothmer had to bend his southern wing on the Dniester back to the west of Nizniow. His center held from Burkanow on the Strypa to south of Zalozce over a width of 45 kilometers as the only part of the former Austro-Hungarian Eastern Front still maintaining its well-developed permanent positions from spring. If further retreats by neighbors made these untenable, increasing manpower needs and thus repercussions on the entire Eastern Front were to be expected. The Commander-in-Chief East tried to assist Army Group Archduke Karl with troops, but given the ongoing pressure in the north, these could only be minor parts, not reaching the strength of a division overall.

On August 10, he resumed the attack along the entire front. While he could only slowly overcome the strong section of the Bystrzyca-Nadwornia front in the center, he forced the Kraewel group in the north to retreat behind the lower Bystrzyca due to overwhelming enemy attacks, also in the evening. The Hadhy group had to abandon Stanislau and retreated behind the Bystrzyca-Solotwinska. Given the low resistance strength of the entire front, Major General von Seeckt now advocated for withdrawing the center of the army behind this watercourse as well. This was significantly requested by Colonel General von K\u00f6vess. The movement, carried out on the night of August 11, proved extremely difficult on roads clogged with trains and refugees. The northern flank of the army tried to hold the Bystrzyca-Nadwornia front in the mountains south of Nadworna, while the southern flank, which was to give up forces, was withdrawn to the Bystrzyca-Solotwinska by August 13. Access to another gateway into Hungary, the Pantyr Pass, was since then only temporarily blocked by a detachment left behind at Zielona against the Russians. They followed along the entire front but no longer had the strength to continue their attack with emphasis.\nMeanwhile, on August 11, the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army3) attacked with the 1st Infantry Division4) together with the Hungarian 40th Infantry Division from the area of Kirlibaba northwards, but was unable to gain decisive ground in difficult forested terrain. Further to the left, the 200th Infantry Division (former Carpathian Corps) did not have much more success. The group, now consisting of the German 1st and 200th and 1\u00bd combined Austro-Hungarian infantry divisions, under General von Schen, came to a standstill in the area from the Romanian border to the Tartar Pass. Further northwest, the army was still tasked with blocking the Pantyr Pass in the future, while on the other hand, it was relieved of some of its border protection duties in Transylvania.</body>\n<footer>1) G. 537 and 615.\n2) Austrian official work, Volume V, p. 190.\n3) Organization starting from the right wing: Austro-Hungarian XI Corps, Group Conta, Group Krau\u00df, totaling 5\u00bd infantry divisions, including two German and two cavalry divisions.\n4) G. 548.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "139": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"und die von ihm bef\u00fcrchtete R\u00fcckwirkung auf Rum\u00e4nien, hatten General von Falkenhayn veranla\u00dft, trotz des dringenden Bedarfs im\".

For the time being, he only \nhad a depleted infantry and a cavalry division, as well as a number of smaller \nunits and formations not suitable for field use.\nThe situation of the German Southern Army became untenable due to \nthe retreat of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, especially since the conditions \non its northern flank with the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army continued to \ncause concern. By August 11, General Count Bothmer had to gradually \nbend his right wing back into the south-facing front Maryampol\u2014 \nMonasterzyska. From there, the line ran to the old permanent position, \nwhich extended from Burkanow to the north. On the left flank, the \ncounterattack planned for August 11 by the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army \ncould not be carried out due to the onset of new Russian attacks\u00b3). This \nkept the situation so tense that General Count Bothmer withdrew his \nnorthern wing, which had been holding out in a far advanced position on \nthe Seret and was also attacked that day, back to his army (Austro-Hungarian \nIX Corps). Since the army was also under pressure from Russian attacks \nat other points, especially at the now sharply protruding corner of \nMonasterzyska, and at the same time had to provide the 48th Reserve \nDivision for the approaching Turkish troops and hold further strong \nreserves to support the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army behind its right wing, \nthe army group and army high command unanimously agreed that the \nextension of the flanks could not continue. The right time to withdraw \nthe front should not be missed. General Count Bothmer considered it \nappropriate on the evening of August 11 and ordered the retreat.

From August 10, the newly formed 199th, then the 10th Bavarian and the 117th Infantry Division, a cyclist brigade, and the general command of the XXIV Reserve Corps were to move from the west to Galicia. The Commander-in-Chief East sent additional parts. By the time these reinforcements arrived, the Austro-Hungarian 3rd, the South, and the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had already disengaged from direct contact with the enemy. Romania also seemed to hesitate. Thus, Colonel General von Conrad considered preempting further enemy assaults with an attack. At the same time, the German Chancellor, as well as the Commander-in-Chief East, advocated that the decision should now be sought against Russia. According to the latter, as Major von Fleischmann reported from Brest on August 15, another four to five divisions could be freed in the west. Colonel General von Conrad was therefore contemplating major plans when General von Falkenhayn visited him in Teschen on August 17 to discuss the situation and measures. He proposed an attack from Oloczow on Dubno to roll up the Russian 11th Army and the northern adjacent army units from the south. However, he deemed at least 20 divisions necessary for this. These could not be assembled. Nor were the forces sufficient for a thrust from the center of the South Army over Trembowla to cut off the Russian troops west of the Dniester. Thus, only the attack south of the river on Kolomea remained. General von Falkenhayn believed that the Army Group Archduke Karl now had over five German divisions \"with which they could do something,\" and he hoped that they \"would decide on this undertaking,\" as relief south of the Dniester seemed as important for securing the oil sources of Boryslaw and especially the access to Hungary as for influencing Romania.\nMeanwhile, the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army had continued the attack in the Carpathians with the latter goal, as the troops once deployed for this could only have been brought to the northern side of the mountains through lengthy marching and transport movements.

However, strong Russian counteraction then set in, primarily driving Austrian-Hungarian troops from Kukul. The enemy came close to the Tartar Pass. New concerns for Hungary led to the 117th Infantry Division being designated for the southern side of the mountains to Maramaros-Sziget on August 19. It was thus unavailable for the planned attack on the Dniester.\nOtherwise, it remained calm for the time being with the Army Group Archduke Karl. In the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, the previous Group Kraewel, which had meanwhile been taken over by General of Infantry von Gerok with the General Command of the XXIV Reserve Corps, had to withdraw the 105th Infantry Division as exhausted behind the front; the 48th Reserve Division took its place. In the Southern Army, the Turkish XV Corps was deployed south of Brzezany on August 20. Since it brought only four field batteries in total, German and Austro-Hungarian artillery had to be assigned to it. In the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, Russian attacks were repelled on August 21 and the following days.\nThus, the second half of August passed without new setbacks. The idea of a counterattack on the Dniester had not yet been abandoned, but the forces were still lacking for its execution.

Nevertheless, Field Marshal von \nHindenburg, in view of the events at the Dniester, immediately sent a \nreinforced infantry regiment there for assistance and on August 8, two \nmore followed. However, this day also brought Russian attacks on their \nown front, especially the expected new major assault against Army Group \nLinsingen, alongside weaker advances at Baranowicze.\nAt Army Group Linsingen, the attack extended across almost the \nentire front from Army Group Marwitz to Army Group Bernhardi. The \nmain thrust was directed against the latter. It was partly conducted in \nsix waves with reserves behind and primarily hit the 107th Infantry \nDivision of Major General Jahndorff, but also the Corps Fath, however, \nonly led to minor temporary breaches. By evening, the positions were \nagain in the full extent in the hands of the German defenders.

He assured that he was fully aware of the connection between his front and that of the Archduke, and that he only harbored offensive intentions where he had to repel the engaged enemy through counterattacks to enable holding. Furthermore, he saw the freeing up of forces for the Archduke Karl Army Group as his most essential task, especially after receiving information about the deployment of the 1st Infantry Division at the Carpathian Corps, far from the battlefield. However, he was currently unable to free up any significant forces, because: \"A strong attack is expected at Mitau, significant Russian forces are positioned in front of Woyrsch, Linsingen is heavily attacked, and the Russians are massing in the breach south of Brody.\" He had supplied the Archduke Karl Army Group with six battalions and four batteries from his forces, which were so weak for the long front, yesterday and was sending another infantry regiment today. Whether the Turkish XV Corps could be directed there was beyond his judgment.\nThe Archduke Karl Army Group informed the Eastern Commander-in-Chief that further allocations were excluded given the current situation. He suggested redirecting the Turkish Corps, which had just reached Kowel by rail transport with its foremost parts, to the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, to which Colonel General von Conrad immediately agreed. General von Falkenhayn agreed to the accomplished fact despite justified concerns, but requested that the Turkish troops not be used with the shaken Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, but rather with the Southern Army to relieve combat-ready units at a relatively quiet location. Otherwise, it was absolutely certain that the Turks would bring no help, but rather this appearance, and that the spirit in which this support was granted by the Turkish military leadership would be gravely violated.\"\nOn August 10, the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had to fend off new heavy Russian attacks south of Zalosce.

This was largely successful. However, the planned recapture of the Seret line was no longer feasible. On the night of August 12, the extreme southern flank, along with the retreating northern flank of the Southern Army, evacuated the position previously held at the Seret. With the continuation of Russian attacks here and at other points along the long, thinly manned front, it seemed necessary to evacuate. The Commander-in-Chief East therefore considered any troop withdrawal temporarily impossible and also refused the requested withdrawal of an Austro-Hungarian division from the Woyrsch army detachment despite strong pressure from the Supreme Army Command. The Field Marshal reported to the Emperor again on August 15 personally, how difficult the situation was: \"Stronger enemy forces are gathering before Mitau, a very strong superiority still stands before Woyrsch, the situation before Linsingen is not yet clarified, the Russian offensive continues at the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army.\" The requested withdrawal called into question the further holding of positions. When the Austro-Hungarian division nevertheless had to be withdrawn, the disputes with the Supreme Army Command took on increasingly irritated forms.\nOn August 18, new Russian attacks began at the army groups Linsingen and Prince Leopold. Generaloberst von Linsingen had again expected the assault mainly against the L\u00fcttwitz and Bernhardi groups and reinforced them accordingly. Instead, the enemy this time surprisingly attacked the Hauer cavalry corps, which had a particularly thin deployment behind the Stochod in a railway and road-poor area, and established a foothold on the border of the Austro-Hungarian 9th and Bavarian cavalry divisions at Rudka-Czerwiszcze on the western riverbank. Varied local battles followed; it was not until August 21 that it seemed assured that the enemy would not break through. On August 23, Lieutenant General Cramon attempted a counterattack with 14 battalions and 16 batteries, but it stalled in the early stages. The same happened with its repetition on August 25. Although this time 17 heavy and 24 light batteries prepared the assault, the troops, consisting almost exclusively of Landwehr, were unable to penetrate the Russian bridgehead position, yet this second attempt cost more than 800 men in losses.</body>\n<footer>1) Strength ratios p. 562.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "145": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Mittlerweile werden auch Euere Exzellenz, aus Ihren bisherigen \u00c4u\u00dferungen zu entnehmen ist, gewi\u00df alles getan\".

On August 21 and the following days, the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army was attacked again, but now unsuccessfully.\nOnly the situation at Mitau, on the extreme northern flank of the army group Eichhorn, continued to cause concern. Here the enemy had assembled 12 to 16 divisions for an attack, and also seemed to be planning a landing behind the German front. To support the defense, only five individual regiments could be provided as intervention troops. However, the Russian attack did not materialize to the expected extent, but was limited to an attempt to cross the Dvina at Lennemaden, which was repelled on August 27.\nF. Questions of the Overall Leadership of the Eastern War in August.\nMap 6.\nOn August 9, news had arrived that Romania's entry into the war was already expected \"around August 14.\" The Commander-in-Chief East therefore assessed the situation as extremely serious when on August 10 the protected new setbacks occurred at the army group Archduke Karl as well as at the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army. The Field Marshal telegraphed the Kaiser: \"The further retreat of the army group Archduke Karl makes me certain of Romania's joining our enemies. Only with the greatest acceleration of the deployment of significant German forces from the West can the threatening situation still be contained. Your Majesty, I implore you to deploy all troops that can somehow be freed up in the West \u2014 these must be four to five divisions \u2014 immediately towards Bukovina north of the Carpathians.\" The Kaiser personally thanked for this message. He left the response to General von Seeckt, who telegraphed the Field Marshal on August 11: One division has been sent east, a second will follow. Further troops would be available if the ongoing new formations had taken shape to some extent. \"In the meantime, Your Excellency, as can be inferred from your previous statements, surely everything has been done to free up units from the front under your command for the mentioned army group.\"\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>haben, um aus der Ihnen unterstellten Front noch Verb\u00e4nde f\u00fcr die genannte Heeresgruppe frei zu machen.</fragment_2>", "146": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"General Ludendorff hoffte, da\u00df vielleicht Generalmajor von Seeckt, da er 'Einflu\u00df im Gro\u00dfen Hauptquartier' habe, erreichen k\u00f6nne, da\u00df 'Kr\u00e4fte zugef\u00fchrt werden, mit denen\".

When Major von Bockelberg, who had been sent to the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, personally reported his extremely serious impressions of the recent battles on the southern flank of this army, the Field Marshal General again appealed to the Kaiser based on this report: \"The troops so far made available for the southeast will not suffice to hold the situation, let alone restore it. The decision on the outcome of the war now lies in the southeast. I dare to express this view to Your Majesty as a loyal servant, even if it concerns matters beyond my command area.\" The situation was further aggravated by the fact that Generaloberst von Conrad now frequently demanded Austro-Hungarian forces back from the area of the Commander-in-Chief East to hold the Isonzo. General von Falkenhayn therefore turned to the Commander-in-Chief East in vain. Then he agreed with Generaloberst von Conrad that the army group Archduke Karl would give up a division and in return would probably soon receive the 117th Infantry Division from the west. However, the news about Romania was again not favorable; it seemed not yet ready to strike immediately. General von Falkenhayn thought that it would probably wait until after the harvest, that is, until October. Despite the difficulties of the overall situation in the east and the necessity of reinforcements, he was not in doubt. He therefore anticipated the return from the west to Ple\u00df on August 15.\nMeanwhile, the Commander-in-Chief East was in constant exchange of ideas with the Austro-Hungarian army command and the army group Archduke Karl about the situation. General Ludendorff hoped that perhaps Major General von Seeckt, since he had \"influence in the Great Headquarters,\" could achieve that \"forces would be brought in with which something could really be done\"; he considered such execution possible unless \"the Isonzo threw a new wrench into the works.\"\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>wirklich etwas zu machen ist\u201c; er hielt solche Ausf\u00fchrung f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich, wenn nicht etwa \u201eder Isonzo einen neuen Strich durch die Rechnung\u201c mache.</fragment_2>", "147": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Nach Vortrag beim Kaiser, wobei vermutlich die Telegramme des Generalfeldmarschalls und des Reichskanzlers er\u00f6rtert wurden, suchte General von Falkenhayn am Morgen des 17.

XII Corps from the Woyrsch Army Detachment, Field Marshal von Hindenburg again turned to the Kaiser: He had just reported that he was not in a position to make such a transfer given the current distribution of enemy forces. After further explanation of the circumstances, the telegram stated: \"If the transport of the Austro-Hungarian division occurs without prior replacement from the west, I cannot guarantee to Your Majesty that the front entrusted to me will be held.\" The Field Marshal therefore requested to refrain from executing the order until either replacement from the west had arrived or the overall situation on his front had improved.\nOn the evening of August 16, the Kaiser and the Supreme Army Command returned to Ple\u00df. Here they received the telegram from the Chancellor. Additionally, a telegram from the Chancellor arrived at the Kaiser, who, after a visit to Vienna, discussed peace possibilities with Russia and pointed out that \"the decision lies more than ever in the east.\" Austro-Hungarian assistance in this regard was only assured insofar as the Kaiser himself took the matter into his hands with German troops. In influential Viennese circles, the expansion of Field Marshal von Hindenburg's command area was welcomed, and it was only regretted that he did not have the entire Eastern Front under his command. To their own military command, it was said with some regret. These circumstances, the Chancellor said, made it imperative to seek the decision now in the east.\nAfter a briefing with the Kaiser, during which presumably the telegrams from the Field Marshal and the Chancellor were discussed, General von Falkenhayn sought Colonel von Conrad in Teschen on the morning of August 17.</body>\n<footer>1) Text S. 637.\n2) Certainty could not be established. \u2014 Genlt. a.D.

There, the matter is \"very vital, the blow hits us in the heart.\" It is \"much less sensitive if we lose Lemberg than if the Italians enter Trieste.\" However, the available German forces were far from sufficient for a major strike in the East, as the discussion revealed. Nevertheless, after their arrival, even if only in a narrowly limited framework, a counterattack should be carried out; Kolomea should be the target.\nAfter returning from Teschen, General von Falkenhayn again presented to the Kaiser and demanded that Field Marshal von Hindenburg not address him directly. The Kaiser let this rest and rejected the Field Marshal's request in a detailed personal response, which, however, was entirely in line with General von Falkenhayn's views and concluded with the sentences: \"My visit to the Western Front and consultation with the leaders and their chiefs there has strengthened my conviction that no man can be withdrawn from there, as the battles against an almost fourfold superiority are very satisfactory. Our arch-enemies want to carry out the preliminary task of holding with the troops available to them and repel the Russian attacks. The division of the Austro-Hungarian XII Corps must be transported immediately. The responsibility for measures ordered by the Supreme Army Command naturally rests exclusively with them.\"\nSubsequently, on August 19, the Commander-in-Chief East again presented the seriousness of the situation to the Supreme Army Command and pointed out that at his front, the increase in troops had been largely offset by simultaneous deductions. However, the enemy had not yet made any recognizable shifts to the front of the Army Group Archduke Karl1). At the same time, the Field Marshal urged Generaloberst von Lyncker to achieve personal reporting to the Supreme War Lord2).

These were measures \nthat could also be judged differently from the higher \nperspective of the Supreme Army Command, as General von Falkenhayn noted in the \nmargins of the explanations. Regarding the current situation at the front, it was stated \nin the report of the Commander-in-Chief East: \"The Winitzau Group \n(59 battalions, 85 batteries) is threatened by an attack from at least twelve divisions \n(II, VI, and VII Siberian as well as XXI, XXXIII, and \nXXXVII Corps, totaling 188 battalions, 99 batteries), perhaps \n(even from 16 divisions) along with a simultaneous landing. In front of \nBoryslaw, there are still 20 infantry and six cavalry \ndivisions) = 320 battalions, 160 batteries against 113 German and \nAustro-Hungarian battalions and 101 batteries.

I expect further attacks here, where I cannot conceal the \nseriousness of the situation, as the Russian forces have \nnot yet diminished, but I could not retain the increase in strength \nthat I consider necessary for securely holding the front, namely three to four divisions instead of one.\"\nAfter explaining the difficulties now arising from the transfer of the Austro-Hungarian 16th Infantry Division, the Field Marshal continued: \"Your Majesty, I have stated in my report of August 5 \nthat I would provide reinforcements for the Butowina as soon as possible, and I can assure Your Majesty \nthat I am well aware of this task.

Reflections.\nIn 1916, the Eastern Front was purely about defense against a massive numerical superiority, which only did not fully come into effect due to the Russians' lesser equipment with heavy artillery, air forces, and technical means of all kinds. It had already been shown in the autumn of 1915 at Luck that not only the resistance but also the offensive capability of the Russians was by no means as diminished as General von Falkenhayn had believed after the summer victories. However, the defensive successes of the Austro-Hungarian army in the New Year battles of 1915/16 and the troops of the Commander-in-Chief East in March 1916 strengthened confidence in the solidity of their own front and led to an underestimation of the Russian threat, which was still significant. Perhaps not enough attention was paid to the fact that in March, the German part of the front benefited greatly from the extraordinarily unfavorable weather and ground conditions for the attackers, which aided the defense against multiple superior forces. Otherwise, help from the West might have already been necessary at that time.\nThe front of the Austro-Hungarian army was less resistant and also poorly equipped with artillery ammunition. The withdrawal of German divisions and Austro-Hungarian core troops in the spring of 1916 was a significant risk, even if the remaining forces were still numerically superior to the enemy. After the Russian attack at Luck, a multiple of what had been taken from this front had to be returned to it, in total (apart from German Landsturm, of which 18 battalions were given from the Western Front) the following reinforcements were successively provided:\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>German Troops</th>\n<th>A.-H.

Despite all tactical successes, the intended operational breakthrough was not nearly achieved. Nor was he able to push the front back far enough to achieve anything decisive. The view in both the German and Austro-Hungarian headquarters was that it was relatively insignificant for the outcome of the war whether one stood in the east at the Stochod or the Turja, at the Dunajec or the Aa, as long as the enemy did not invade Hungary or \u2014 as was likely associated with it \u2014 induce Romania to enter the war.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>nach Ungarn einbrach oder \u2014 was damit wahrscheinlich verbunden war \u2014 Rum\u00e4nien zum Eintritt in den Krieg veranla\u00dfte.</fragment_2>", "153": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Diese gewaltigen Verluste an K\u00e4mpfern konnten\".

The latter, however, was not \ndependent solely on the situation in the East, but on the overall \nsituation of the Central Powers. Therefore, the transfer of stronger German \nforces to the Eastern Front could only have influenced the decision of that country \nif they were sufficient to achieve a widely visible victory, without causing \nthe front in the West to suffer even more hardship than was already the case.\nThus, from the standpoint of warfare against Russia, \nthe insistence of the Eastern commanders on increased allocations \nof reinforcements was justified, as was, on the other hand, the \nsupreme command responsible for overall warfare holding back to the utmost. \nTo provide as much as would have been necessary to achieve a major success \nwas not yet possible in terms of space, time, and resources. Certainly, a few more divisions \nwould have eased the situation in the East, perhaps spared this or that setback. \nHowever, they would hardly have brought decisive improvement to the overall situation. \nMore would have been required than the West could give up in the summer \nof 1916. For the struggle in the East was not easy.\nIn view of the enemy's superiority, the German troops \nalso had to struggle extremely hard here. They can be proud of what \nthey achieved, partly on their own front, partly as supports of the Austro- \nHungarian lines, for almost three months without relief in tough \ncombat. The severity of the task corresponded to the losses, which \nrose to a total of 148,000 men, of which 85,000 were in the defense \nagainst the Brusilov Offensive. In terms of numbers, they were hardly behind \nthose of the defensive battles in the West, but were spread over \na longer period. The loss figures, since it was mainly about defense, \nwere significantly lower in terms of booty, with only 50,000 prisoners, \nabout 200 machine guns, and an insignificant number of artillery pieces.\nThe losses of the Austro-Hungarian Eastern Army were much heavier. \nIt lost more than 511,000 men in battle alone, of which more than two-thirds \nwere prisoners and missing. The Russians claim to have taken 378,000 prisoners, \na number that, even if about 20,000 prisoners from German units are included, \nseems exaggerated.

For the operation of this network, in addition to the numerous military formations and auxiliary forces from the German railways, 58,000 officials and workers as well as almost 4,000 locomotives were employed.

As the coverage of the\ndemand thus seemed secured for a longer time, the army administration\ninitiated the replacement of the oldest cohorts of Landsturm soldiers\ndirectly at the front with younger forces, fulfilling long-held wishes of the broadest public.\nThe favorable replacement conditions were, however, not least due to\nthe fact that restraint was imposed on the formation of\nnew units. At the beginning of the year, the Ministry of War had declared to the\nsupreme army command that new formations should be avoided as much as possible\nif the stock of replacement troops was to last for a longer time. Besides expanding still incomplete\nfield units, the focus was mainly on increasing technical and special troops, such as machine gun sharpshooter\nunits, foot artillery and anti-aircraft batteries, airmen, mortar\nand communication formations, often using already existing units\nwhich were accordingly reorganized.\nThe Battle of the Somme, with its high casualty figures,\nhowever, threw all calculations overboard. Already in the first ten\ndays of fighting, more than 100,000 replacement troops had to be sent to the field,\nand during the almost continuous major battles that followed,\nthe replacement demands remained at about the same level. To\nprevent the rapid depletion of the replacement stock and to avoid having to resort too early\nto the next and provisionally last recruitment year (1898),\nthe army administration was forced to take special measures: The withdrawal of the older Landsturm cohorts from\nthe front was suspended; the militarily previously unused remainder of eligible Landsturm conscripts was largely\ndrafted; replacement demands of the troops were only fulfilled to the full extent in the most urgent\ncases; those fit for war service, who had been detached to the various\nservices behind the front arising from the needs of the long positional warfare, were\nreplaced in considerable numbers by those fit for garrison duty and returned to the combat\ntroops.\nThanks to this management of forces, the troops engaged in the heaviest\ndefensive battles could be somewhat adequately supplied with replacements.\nAt the same time, new formations could repeatedly be undertaken on a larger scale,\nas the tense war situation imperatively demanded. Including four divisions composed of replacement troops\nintended for coastal defense at home, 16 new divisions were formed during the summer months, partially by expanding already existing brigades, so that the total number of German divisions increased to 175 by the end of August 1916.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Brigaden 16 neue Divisionen1), so da\u00df sich die Gesamtzahl der deutschen Divisionen bis Ende August 1916 auf 1752) erh\u00f6hte.</fragment_2>", "158": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"\u00c4hnlich wie die Ersatzversorgung lie\u00df sich im ersten Halbjahr 1916 auch die Versorgung des Heeres mit Waffen und Munition ohne wesentliche Schwierigkeiten bewerkstelligen.

As another source of replenishment, apart from those recovered and deferred, there remained the recruit class of 18983).\nGreater were the difficulties in replacing and procuring horses. The horses in the field had suffered greatly from lack of fodder, poor accommodation, and overexertion; on average, 12% of the horses in the West Army and 20% in the East Army were under veterinary treatment each month. By establishing numerous horse hospitals behind the front, efforts were made to promote the recovery of sick and exhausted horses and to contain the risk of epidemics. The homeland could hardly supply any more horses due to the increasing strain on the economic situation; even purchases abroad and in occupied territories yielded only slight increases. Drastic measures had to be taken to meet the demand, which averaged 16,000 horses per month for replacements and new formations. Thus, the War Ministry not only significantly reduced the number of horses in the field and draft army and sought to save on animal traction by increasing the motorization of batteries and columns, but in the summer of 1916, it also proceeded to dissolve a larger number of reserve, landwehr, and landsturm cavalry formations, making around 17,000 horses available for other purposes, mainly for the harnessing of batteries. In the East Army, part of the disbanded units was reorganized into a total of nine unmounted cavalry rifle regiments.\nSimilar to the replacement supply, the supply of the army with weapons and ammunition in the first half of 1916 could be managed without significant difficulties. This was due as much to the foresighted, constantly production-increasing activities of the army administration and its organs as to the tireless work, which was carried out in the ever-increasing scope of the war industry.</body>\n<footer>1) 183, 185, 187, 192., 195., 197, 199.\u2014204., 12. and 14.

The increased demands of the Verdun battle, where the ammunition consumption rose to unexpected heights, could be fully met. General von Falkenhayn particularly recognized this in a letter of thanks to the Ministry of War as a \"truly magnificent achievement.\"\nIn the spring of 1916, the monthly production of the most important weapons and types of ammunition not only covered the ongoing needs but also equipped the new formations. The continuous increase in modern heavy artillery also enabled a faster replacement of the older equipment still deployed at the front.\nEfforts were made to further increase the achieved performance. The factories working for the army's needs increased their capacity. Numerous additional plants were brought in, mainly for the production of light artillery, ammunition, and close combat materials or the necessary semi-finished products. They initially had to overcome some manufacturing difficulties due to the novelty of the task.\nThe growing scarcity of raw materials also particularly affected ammunition production. Careful management of the available stocks by the War Raw Materials Department, which under the prudent and energetic leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Koeth systematically expanded and extended the management of war-important raw materials, mitigated this shortage. The use of substitute materials gained increasing importance. Lower quality of ammunition often had to be accepted. With the increasing delivery of pressed steel and cast steel shells, the production of inferior gray cast iron shells could be increasingly restricted.\nHowever, in one area, the enemy armaments industry gained an unexpected advantage. While on the German side, the heavy indirect fire had rightly been promoted most strongly for offensive and mobile warfare, the Western opponents had since the beginning of the war switched to increasing heavy direct fire on a large scale. In contrast, on the German side, although on fortifications and gradually also on naval guns were resorted to, the enemy at Verdun was able to increase his flat fire, which reached over 12,000 meters, from 82 to 402 guns between February and June, while the German attacker could only increase from 211 to 228, almost half of which had a range of only 10,000 meters and less.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) On average, during the first two months of the attack at Verdun, 2.8 million rounds of field artillery and 1.3 million rounds of foot artillery ammunition were fired.

To compensate, only heavy high-angle guns of the latest manufacture were considered. However, they had to fire at extreme ranges, i.e., with \"maximum charge,\" were prematurely worn out, and thus resulted in sensitive equipment failures.\nThe necessity of the continued increase in weapons and ammunition production was demonstrated by the Battle of the Somme. The lavish use of materials with which the opponents sought to shatter the German front there corresponded on the German side to a high wear and tear of weapons due to wear and destruction by enemy fire. In the months of July and August, around 1600 light and 760 heavy guns had to be replaced at the front. Above all, however, the field artillery required enormous amounts of ammunition for barrage fire in the defense against enemy attacks. Its total ammunition consumption on all battlefields reached the unprecedented height of nearly eleven million rounds in July and August, almost three times the entire ammunition stock of the field artillery at the beginning of the war. During the same period, the heavy artillery fired around three million rounds.\nSince the new production could by no means keep pace with this enormous ammunition consumption of the field artillery, stocks quickly dwindled. Therefore, measures had to be taken with the greatest acceleration to increase production as quickly as possible. Above all, it was necessary to increase powder production, on which ammunition production was critically dependent. It was not until the spring of 1916 that the quantity aimed for since early 1915 of 6000 tons per month was reached. In July, the powder program, which had already been increased to 8000 tons by the end of 1915, was again increased by 2000 tons to a monthly production of 10,000 tons. However, it was necessary to resort to ammon powder (an Asian mixture of raw lead and ammonium nitrate) to a greater extent than before, which was inferior and limited in its use to certain types of guns, but its production posed fewer difficulties.</body>\n<footer>1) Appendix 1, Comparison of German and enemy artillery.\n2) Volume IX, C. 382.\n3) Ibid., C. 395.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "161": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Im Fr\u00fchsommer nahm der Mangel an Speisefetten solchen Umfang an, da\u00df staatliche Verteilung eingef\u00fchrt wurde, um wenigstens f\u00fcr das Heer,\".

Initially, it was still possible to compensate for the shortage of one type of food by increased consumption of others, especially through ample meat imports, but eventually, this possibility also dwindled. Everything became alarmingly scarce and expensive. Maximum prices proved ineffective; the markets felt more the imbalance. As early as autumn 1915, \"meatless days\" had been introduced. In the spring of 1916, potatoes became scarce and had to be rationed. Higher flour portions were issued from Austria. The large stocks of coffee, tea, and cocoa inherited from peacetime were running out, and with them the much-used coffee substitutes chicory and figs. The confiscation of the remaining stocks made these luxury foods almost completely disappear from the food plan. In early summer, the shortage of edible fats reached such proportions that state distribution was introduced to at least ensure for the army, the sick, and the children somewhat adequate quantities.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>die Kranken und die Kinder einigerma\u00dfen ausreichende Mengen zu sichern.</fragment_2>", "162": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is:\n\"wenn\"\nThis is clearly an incomplete fragment, as it ends with \"wenn,\" which is a conjunction typically used to introduce a subordinate clause.\n\n<fragment_1>wenn</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is:\n\"die landwirtschaftliche Erzeugung auf der bisherigen H\u00f6he gehalten und m\u00f6glichst noch gesteigert wurde, und wenn zur F\u00fctterung der Pferde und des Viehs in weitest gehendem Ma\u00dfe alle nur irgendwie geeigneten Ersatzmittel herangezogen wurden.\"\nThis continues the thought from `fragment_1` and completes the sentence.\n\n<fragment_2>die landwirtschaftliche Erzeugung auf der bisherigen H\u00f6he gehalten und m\u00f6glichst noch gesteigert wurde, und wenn zur F\u00fctterung der Pferde und des Viehs in weitest gehendem Ma\u00dfe alle nur irgendwie geeigneten Ersatzmittel herangezogen wurden.</fragment_2>\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` is clearly incomplete as it ends with \"wenn,\" indicating a subordinate clause is to follow.\n- `fragment_2` logically and grammatically continues `fragment_1`, completing the sentence.\n- Combining them forms a coherent sentence: \"wenn die landwirtschaftliche Erzeugung auf der bisherigen H\u00f6he gehalten und m\u00f6glichst noch gesteigert wurde, und wenn zur F\u00fctterung der Pferde und des Viehs in weitest gehendem Ma\u00dfe alle nur irgendwie geeigneten Ersatzmittel herangezogen wurden.\"\n\n<decision>The fragments align and form a coherent sentence.</decision>\n</thinking>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>632</pageno>\n<header>The Further Development in Other Areas of Warfare.</header>\n<body>to secure somewhat adequate quantities for the sick and the children. \nFor the others, only a fraction of the usual peacetime consumption remained. \nThe war, which had lasted almost two years, had already significantly depleted \nthe livestock; the number of pigs had fallen to half of the peacetime stock. \nThe meat supply not only for the population but also for the army was in question. \nThus, this too had to be taken into public management. This led in the summer of 1916 \nto a meat allocation that resulted in only 250 grams per person per week. \nSince the final determination of the 1915 harvest showed significantly less favorable \nresults than expected, bread portions had to be reduced from 225 to 200 grams. \nFurther restrictions could only be avoided through Romanian grain deliveries. \nFinally, even vegetables and fruits, sauerkraut and syrup, canned fruits, jams, \nand dried vegetables, and lastly the most nutritious legumes had to be more or less \ncompletely taken into public management.

However, after more than a year of service, he lacked the outstanding reputation both in his own army and among the allies, which the responsible leader of the overall operations for the continuation of the coalition war required. Moreover, the relationship with the Chief of the General Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces lacked cordiality and openness despite restored external form; with the Turkish and Bulgarian army leadership, they were good. No improvement had occurred in the tense official and personal relationship with the Commander-in-Chief East. A marginal note made by General von Falkenhayn in February 1916 to a proposal submitted to him is indicative: \"General Ludendorff and I simply cannot come together. The waters are much too deep.\" There were also no closer confidential relations with any of the army leaders of the Western army. Without exception, they judged the planning and actions of the Chief of the General Staff with reservation, if not with doubts.\nThe relationship, which had always lacked inner harmony and had already escalated to a breaking point around the turn of the year 1914/15, had deteriorated again by the end of 1915 with the head of politics. The personal opposition had become evident when General von Falkenhayn directed his statement on the ineffectiveness of peace efforts with unusual sharpness to the address of the Chancellor on November 29. In the spring of 1916, the factual disagreements on the issue of unrestricted submarine warfare led to a complete break, and since the Kaiser finally sided entirely with the Chancellor, it resulted in a severe defeat for the Chief of the General Staff. General von Falkenhayn requested to be relieved of his position. Since he justified this by stating that the Chancellor had obtained the decision without his involvement, the Kaiser refused to comply with his Chief of the General Staff's request. However, their personal relationship was strained due to disagreements over submarine warfare, resulting in a tension that occasionally manifested in sharp disputes during briefings due to the General's irritability.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>eine Spannung, die sich gelegentlich bei Vortr\u00e4gen infolge der Gereiztheit des Generals in scharfen Auseinandersetzungen \u00e4u\u00dferte.</fragment_2>", "165": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg und General Ludendorff hinzuzuziehen.

The assumption is close at hand that the growing disappointment from month to month over the \ncourse of operations in the Maas area, the unexpected turn of events in the East, and finally the intensified \ncriticism of the overall situation due to the Battle of the Somme gradually shook the Supreme War Lord's \nunconditional trust in the leadership of General von Falkenhayn.\nIn the military circle of the Kaiser, the serving General Adjutant, Generaloberst von Plessen, harbored doubts, \nabove all, whether the Chief of Staff would be able to master the increasingly difficult circumstances. The \nReich Chancellor also seemed newly convinced that General von Falkenhayn was not up to his position. He therefore \nrefrained, in agreement with the Chief of the Secret Civil Cabinet von Valentini, from expressing this conviction \nto the Kaiser. \"I would like to believe,\" he wrote to the Cabinet Chief on June 14, \"that it is the duty of \nGeneral von Lyncker to present the situation openly to the Kaiser... Military considerations, \nwhich come from me, are rejected but are necessary to give due emphasis to the general political considerations\"). \nThe Chief of the Military Cabinet, Generaloberst Freiherr von Lyncker, however, firmly refused to suggest a \npersonnel change to the Kaiser.\nThe discussions and negotiations that began at the end of June regarding the appointment of Field Marshal von \nHindenburg with the unified command in the East \nwere of decisive influence on the development of events*). Initially, the Supreme War Lord still fully supported \nthe standpoint of General von Falkenhayn. A contrast only became apparent after July 22, when the Kaiser, under \nthe impression of the concerns and wishes conveyed by the Chancellor from the influential Hungarian politician \nCount Andrassy, decided to resolve the contentious issues of command in the East through personal discussions \nbetween Abel and Archduke Friedrich and to include Field Marshal von Hindenburg and General Ludendorff in these \nnegotiations. General von Falkenhayn perceived the latter measure as an infringement of his rights as the sole \nresponsible advisor to the Supreme War Lord and saw it as a sign of lacking trust, that he did not side with him in the subsequent oral discussions.\n</body>\n<footer>* von Valentini: \"Kaiser und Kabinettschef\", p. 230. \n1) p. 524 ff.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>da\u00df dieser sich bei den folgenden m\u00fcndlichen Auseinandersetzungen nicht auf seine Seite stellte.</fragment_2>", "166": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Das geht auch aus dem Antransport der im Westen so ben\u00f6tigten\".

Through his subsequent self-imposed exclusion from further negotiations, the matters were settled without his involvement. However, he did not draw the final conclusions from the increasingly unbearable situation, but abandoned the intention to resign from his office after consulting with the head of the military cabinet.\nImmediately after the regulation of command relationships in the East, a trial of strength arose between the Chief of the General Staff and the Commander-in-Chief East due to disagreements over the deployment of troops and the distribution of reinforcements, about whose seriousness and significance there could be no doubt1). The Supreme War Lord, to whom the Commander-in-Chief East repeatedly turned directly, was anxious to prevent a break and to reconcile again and again. In the extremely tense war situation, he was concerned that a change of personalities in the highest leadership positions of the army could have adverse effects on operations and be interpreted by foreign countries as a sign of internal weakness.\nOn August 19, Field Marshal von Hindenburg personally urged the head of the military cabinet that he had \"after long and thorough consideration, had to gain the conviction that his actions no longer had the approval and his leadership no longer had the trust of the Kaiser.\" He requested a personal presentation to the Kaiser as soon as possible, to which only Generaloberst von Lyncker and General Ludendorff should be added. Merely for the information of the head of the military cabinet himself, but not for the presentation to the Kaiser, he added that he must consider his conviction as confirmed if the Supreme War Lord did not wish his presentation.\nThe Kaiser rejected the requested immediate presentation through a telegram sent the same day to the Field Marshal, in which he sought to dispel his concerns as unfounded and stated: \"I must, as Supreme War Lord, even if often with a heavy heart, put aside the wishes of my army leaders if the general war situation, as I see it, requires it. In this, the army leader must never see a personal measure or even a lack of trust. It will always be the endeavor of the Supreme War Lord, as far as it is within his power, to help his leaders.

Your Majesty's decision to restore the situation in the East with all our available forces is the only means to withstand the complete collapse of Austria and thus the loss of the war. The alarming weakness of Austria makes it a bitter necessity that we temporarily forgo all and any action in the West, which does not make our defense absolutely necessary, to save every single man to deploy him where the final decision of this world war is now imminent.\"\nOn August 19, the Chancellor informed the Chief of the Military Cabinet: \"I hear that serious frictions have recently arisen between Hindenburg and the Supreme Army Command. In the event that this leads to a personnel resignation, I must emphasize once again that the resignation of the Field Marshal would have the most serious military and political consequences.

He took the opportunity to vigorously defend himself against the accusations made against his military leadership in a very detailed letter to the Chancellor on August 21, and to justify his rejection of a decisive offensive on the eastern front with partly fundamental arguments. At the same time, he also provided his interpretation, which the Chancellor had given to his war plan:\n\"... It seems necessary to me to comment on this in order to prevent incorrect assessments of military events and conditions and to avoid the creation of legends. The plan mentioned by Your Excellency is unknown to the Supreme Army Command. In particular, I have never even considered that the Maas or Tyrol offensive could bring France to peace. How we would be forced to conduct the war in the future given the superiority of our enemies and other decisive factors, I explained to Your Excellency when I established the absolute military possibility in December 1915 to timely create the possibility of the Somme offensive, unfortunately, only too well confirmed my assumptions. We have not deviated from the guidelines developed at that time by a single step. We will not deviate from them for the simple reason that we cannot. The offensives on the Maas and in Tyrol were undertaken independently of each other, one in mid-February, the other in mid-May, and indeed the latter, in Tyrol, against the unanimous advice of the relevant Supreme Army Command. This advice was given around the turn of the year 1915/16 and was accepted at that time. If later compliance was insisted upon, it is because the Austro-Hungarian Supreme Army Command deliberately made their agreement binding on the German Supreme Army Command. As for the attack in the Maas area, it does not pursue the immediate goal of inclining France towards peace, at least no more than any positive military action does. Rather, specific special purposes were to bleed France dry if its army positioned itself before the fortress, and if the fortress is abandoned, to paralyze the further course of the war through internal disruptions as much as possible, and on the other hand, to provoke England into prematurely deploying all its forces.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Ersch\u00fctterungen f\u00fcr den weiteren Kriegsverlauf m\u00f6glichst lahmzulegen, andererseits England zum vorzeitigen Einsatz seiner gesamten Kr\u00e4fte zu reizen.</fragment_2>", "169": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Bei den Zahlenverh\u00e4ltnissen, dem Druck auf unsere West- und\".

This requires no further proof for those who realize what would probably have happened if France could have deployed the strong quarter-million of seasoned soldiers it lost more before Verdun than we did, still at the Somme or elsewhere, and if England had only now begun its offensive after we had to weaken our reserves in the West so extraordinarily in favor of the East. It is therefore not reasonable to admit that France's unexpected resistance strength caused a plan, which, as said, did not exist, to fail.\"\nGeneral von Falkenhayn then elaborated on the warfare against Russia and the question of shifting the focus to the East:\n\"Equally, there can be no talk of a surprising striking power of Russia. Wherever the newly formed Russian masses have encountered German troops, they have so far performed miserably despite enormous superiority. The Russians have not improved more than the German Supreme Army Command assumed. The error in our calculation lies rather in the fact that we overestimated our allies. They have become far less than we could ever have suspected based on the numerous reports received from the Austrian-Hungarian troops commanding German commanders and many German officers sent to the Austrian front for control purposes. This fact is indisputable, the consequence that must be drawn from it, however, is not that the military decision of the war now lies more than ever in the East, but simply that we have to sufficiently support the wavering allies to bring the Russian flood to a halt. This has been done by the Supreme Army Command within the limits of what is possible in a timely manner, without any external suggestion being necessary, because it is simply a matter of course. However, the repeated emphasis and underlining of this self-evidence is not only questionable but, in my view, even highly dangerous in many directions. It is initially suitable to arouse or strengthen the thought among laypeople that we are at all capable of decisively defeating Russia militarily. But that is no more the case today than it was from the fourth day of the war. Given the numerical ratios, the pressure on our western and northwestern flanks, and the demands placed on us by our allies, we lacked the means and the time to do so.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Nordwestflanke, den Anforderungen, die die Verb\u00fcndeten an uns stellen, fehlten uns die Mittel und die Zeit dazu.</fragment_2>", "170": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Der naheliegende Gedanke, die Kr\u00e4fte zwischen Ost und West oder zwischen einem Frontabschnitt und dem anderen zu\".

With this judgment, I find myself in the very good company of my two predecessors. If in this war sometimes and even from military quarters the opposite view has been propagated, it was regularly and easily proven that their representatives had not chosen the hard facts of sober military reality as the sole guideline for their conclusions. Furthermore, the emphasis that the military decision lay in the East contributes to complete confusion of views about our actual war situation. The knowledgeable person who speaks does so under the assumption that in the West the iron wall holds as before. The layman, however, does not know this assumption and concludes quite logically that it is incomprehensible why ruthless forces are not thrown from the West to the East if the decision is to be made here. In fact, the situation is rather the opposite. Whether we fight in the East on the Dvina or the Aa, on the Berezina or the Neman, on the Stochod or the Turija, is irrelevant for the war decision, unless Romania's intervention would be brought about, which, however, according to my conviction, depends on completely different factors. On the other hand, a sudden backward movement in the West would certainly shake our entire front. In such a case, even brilliant successes in the East could no longer help us. In the tension in which we are forced to fight, the relations between the two fronts are such that it is impossible to give preference to one over the other, not even temporarily and conditionally.\n\"Finally, the emphasis on the East has the effect \u2014 and this is its worst consequence \u2014 that it infinitely complicates the main task of the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army, the correct distribution of forces. Here, too, I must return to the already mentioned, somewhat numerous lay class, which in this sense also includes many members in field gray and indeed up to the highest positions. This class believes it is sufficient to decide where to strike and accordingly shift the surplus of forces. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Under the enormous pressure that rests on us, we have no surplus of forces.

At noon, a meeting took place \u2014 whether in the presence of General von Falkenhayn is questionable \u2014 between the German Kaiser and Field Marshal Archduke Friedrich, about which no details are known. A discussion between the two chiefs of staff the following day led to no result. On August 25, Archduke Friedrich personally obtained the decision of Kaiser Franz Josef in Vienna. It resulted in a counterproposal, which, along with a long accompanying letter from Generaloberst von Conrad, reached General von Falkenhayn on August 27. It stated that the planned war leadership would be entirely ineffective in practice if prior agreement on operations was not reached; for no army leadership would refrain from acting according to its own orders if its own national interest required it. The consideration of Germany's interests was indeed guaranteed in General von Falkenhayn's proposal, which claimed the decision for itself by the German supreme army leadership. However, the transfer of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces to a foreign warlord and a foreign army leadership encroached on the political sphere and also determined the future relationship of Austria-Hungary to the German Empire. Therefore, an agreement was proposed, according to which prior agreement should be reached in the future on the operations to be conducted. If this did not succeed, the word of the German and the Austro-Hungarian army leadership should be decisive. This rejected what General von Falkenhayn wanted. Practically speaking, everything remained the same.\nThe establishment of a joint supreme war leadership under the German Kaiser would have been such a military and political success that it would have also elevated and newly consolidated the position of General von Falkenhayn. The failure of the attempt coincided with the ominous worsening of the war situation caused by the Romanian declaration of war on Austria-Hungary. As much as General von Falkenhayn had anticipated the possibility of this event, he was unprepared for its occurrence at that dangerous time. This turn of events struck the Kaiser even harder. Deep despondency seized him upon receiving the news on the evening of August 27. At this fateful moment, when the course of the war seemed to be approaching a threatening proximity, there was no higher task for the Chief of the General Staff than to restore to his Supreme War Lord the lost confidence in victory and to strengthen the wavering belief in the ability of his responsible advisor.\n</body>\n<footer>1) p. 602 f.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>es keine h\u00f6here Aufgabe f\u00fcr den Generalstabschef, als seinem Obersten Kriegsherrn die verlorene Zuversicht auf den Sieg zur\u00fcckzugeben und den wankenden Glauben an das K\u00f6nnen seines verantwortlichen Ratgebers zu st\u00e4rken.</fragment_2>", "175": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Noch am Abend des 28.

The consequences for the continuation of the war were obvious. The Kaiser was disappointed and dissatisfied. In a discussion following the report, Generaloberst von Plessen and, for the first time, Generaloberst von Lyncker expressed their conviction that the resignation of General von Falkenhayn and his replacement by the Supreme Commander East was absolutely necessary. \"His Majesty\" \u2014 as Generaloberst von Plessen wrote in his diary \u2014 \"holds a long discourse on the merits of Falkenhayn and the inconvenience of the change. I remain convinced, and His Majesty agrees with my view. Lyncker supports me bravely! Hindenburg will be immediately summoned to Plesz with Ludendorff.

There is no specific single reason, it is rather the result of a longer development. Both the Kaiser and I bear this heavily.\"\nGeneral von Falkenhayn, upon receiving the news from Generaloberst von Lyncker about the appointment of the Supreme Commander East, immediately requested to be relieved from his position.

At the beginning of November, the fighting armies, after unsuccessfully exhausting their forces, had fallen into a pronounced state of equilibrium along the entire front from the North Sea to the Swiss border, leading to the stagnation of trench warfare. At the same time, the scales of war fortune in the East had once again tilted in favor of the Central Powers. It had become doubtful whether they would still be able to hold back the Russian \"steamroller.\"\nThe German Chief of General Staff faced the question of whether to shift the focus of warfare from the West to the East and to launch a decisive offensive with strong forces. For a short time, he was inclined to do so when the Commander-in-Chief East reported his intention to advance from the area of Gnesen\u2014Thorn against the right flank of the main Russian force in Poland. It was probably the only moment when the goddess of war fortune visibly extended her hand to General von Falkenhayn. Had a further strong army, predominantly composed of Western troops, been deployed immediately after the start of the new 9th Army's attack west of the Vistula, to strike south of the river into the rear of the main Russian force, a devastating defeat could have been achieved by human reckoning. A bold and grand plan aimed in this direction, which General von Falkenhayn had thoroughly considered at the time, was not executed, mainly because he made it dependent on the condition that the offensive actions on the Western Front were first brought to a victorious conclusion by capturing Ypres.\nThere is a lack of contemporary historical source material to say with certainty what considerations and motivations were decisive for the Chief of General Staff's prolonged insistence on continuing the attack on Ypres. Here, as elsewhere, the historical clarification and elucidation of his innermost thoughts and motives are limited, beyond which there remains room for speculation and interpretation. We believe the reasons for this decision should primarily be sought in the psychological realm. Certainly, General von Falkenhayn no longer concealed at this time and was internally burdened by the fact that not only had his first strategic plan failed, through which he had intended to convert the Marne campaign, lost by his predecessor, into the decisive victory of Amiens, but also that the Flanders offensive had failed to achieve its operationally limited objective. It is understandable that he, a man called upon in the hour of need, imbued with a passionate drive for victory, resisted with all the tenacity of his unspent will against the public admission of his failure, as it seemed to him to lie in the abandonment of the offensive on the western theater of war.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>der Stunde der Not berufene, von leidenschaftlichem Siegesdrang beseelte Mann sich mit der ganzen Z\u00e4higkeit seines unverbrauchten Willens gegen das \u00f6ffentliche Eingest\u00e4ndnis seines Fehlschlages wehrte, wie es ihm in dem Abbruch der Offensive auf dem westlichen Kriegsschauplatz zu liegen schien.</fragment_2>", "178": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"wenn sie sehen mu\u00dften, wie die Hoffnungen, die sie gerade im jetzigen\".

Ultimately,\nmore was at stake here than his own person and the fame of the commander; it was about\nthe impact on the psychological state of the army, the trust between leadership and troops,\nindeed between leadership and the people. The higher the hopes were, with which the army\nand homeland accompanied the heavy struggle on enemy soil, where Germany's best youth\nstormed against the enemy, trusting firmly to bring home the final victory, the more the\nChief of the General Staff might have feared that a deep, incalculable psychological setback\ncould occur if he abandoned this attack and thereby publicly admitted that all previous\nefforts, all bloody sacrifices had been in vain. Such an outcome could also have disastrous\neffects on the mood of the allies, the stance of the neutrals, and the confidence of victory\nof the enemies. All such worries and fears could be alleviated by a visible and impressive\nmilitary success, which, even if it remained locally limited and had no further influence on\nthe initial stage of the movement war, could still become morally and politically significant.\nIf, through a final, utmost exertion, the hotly contested opera was brought down, which was\noperatively completely worthless, also tactically of little importance, but morally the\npalladium of the enemies, then the whole world saw the victory of the German arms.\nIn retrospect, much can certainly be argued against such lines of thought. The morale of\nthe army and the people was so high that it could have easily endured far more serious\nburdens. General von Falkenhayn later declared in the army report that the goal of the\nbattles in Flanders was achieved through the complete thwarting of the enemy's encirclement\nattempts, and this declaration did not fail to have its effect. For the stance of the allied and\nneutral foreign countries, a decisive victory over the Russian army could have a much greater\ninfluence than the fall of Ypres. The Danube monarchy and the newly gained Turkish ally,\nbut also the neutral states of Romania and Bulgaria, were much more directly affected by\nthe course of military actions in the East than by events in Flanders. It would also have\nmeant a bitter disappointment for England and France if they had to see how the hopes,\nwhich they had especially in the current moment, placed to a heightened degree on the\ndevastating impact of the Russian mass assault, collapsed under a German sledgehammer blow.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Augenblick in erh\u00f6htem Ma\u00dfe auf die vernichtende Wirkung des russischen Massenansturms setzten, unter einem deutschen Keulenschlag zusammenbrachen.</fragment_2>", "179": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"In jenen Tagen zeichnete General von Wild auf:\"\n\n<fragment_1>In jenen Tagen zeichnete General von Wild auf:</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"\u201eFalkenhayn ist seiner selbst nicht ganz sicher ...

For such a decision was not necessarily tied to a promising momentary situation, as it presented itself in November. It had to be the result of slowly matured considerations about the overall situation, had to be the result of slowly matured insights and, regardless of the undertaking, create fundamental clarity about the one big question of how and in what way the multi-front and coalition war should be brought to a decision. In years of intellectual work, Count Schlieffen had once established a solid, clear program of grand simplicity in the form of a war plan, which saw the decisive act of war in the rapid defeat of the Western powers. Since the strategic guiding idea of this war plan had finally broken down in the autumn of 1914, the responsible leader of the overall war effort faced the difficult task, in the midst of the pressure of military events, but unhindered by the acceleration of the moment, to find a new, long-term war plan solely based on the overall situation and in agreement with the allied military leadership.\nSuch a new plan is not recognizable in the warfare of General von Falkenhayn after the final failure at Ypres. No new strategic guiding idea replaced the one laid to rest. The grand proposal for a decisive offensive operation against the Russians, which had been briefly outlined to the allied chief of staff, disappeared from General von Falkenhayn's thoughts as quickly as it had come, before it had taken shape as a firm plan. The destruction of his hitherto maintained hope for victory at Ypres with unusual persistence and the anxious doubt that perhaps a favorable situation in the East had been missed, caused despondency in his soul and paralyzed his thoughts. In those days, General von Wild noted: \"Falkenhayn is not quite sure of himself ...

We are indeed \nessentially reliant on the statements he made in his memoirs after the war \ndue to the lack of documentary evidence.

His assessment \nof the chances of success and views during this period almost equated \nto a renunciation of the idea of forcing a decision in the war with military \nmeans from his own initiative.\nCertainly, it must be credited to General von Falkenhayn that he \nrecognized early on \"the increasingly clear plan of England to win the \nwar through attrition and exhaustion.\" Since the obvious idea of effectively \ncountering this plan through the ruthless use of the German naval forces \ndid not promise success according to the naval command, he saw the path to salvation only in \"cautious husbanding of the resources of Germany and its allies\" in view of the fundamentally changed situation and the significance far exceeding all previous expectations that had to be attributed to the economic factors of warfare.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) Volume VI, p. 95.\n2) von Falkenhayn, op. cit., p. 20 ff.\n</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Generalstabschef im Hinblick auf die von Grund aus gewandelte Lage und alle bisherigen Vorstellungen weit \u00fcbertreffende Bedeutung, die den wirtschaftlichen Faktoren der Kriegsf\u00fchrung zugebilligt werden mu\u00dfte, den Weg der Rettung nur noch in \u201evorsichtigem Haushalten mit den Mitteln Deutschlands und seiner Verb\u00fcndeten\u201c.</fragment_2>", "181": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Dabei l\u00e4\u00dft sich nicht bestreiten, da\u00df General von Falkenhayn sowohl mit\".

The healthy sense for the fundamental condition of any military performance preserved General von Falkenhayn from the final conclusion \"that merely enduring passively (in defense) could still promise success.\" He was rather convinced that \"under all circumstances, action in attack\" must be \"hammered into\" the enemies, \"how little they were capable of paying the price for our overwhelming\"\u00b9). However, it is obvious that with such narrowly defined objectives for practical \"action in attack,\" any large plan, any agreement with the allied army leadership on the conduct of operations over a wide view was abandoned from the outset. This posed the danger that the previously granted initiative of warfare would be lost. The enemies were free to act as they wished.\nFrom this basic attitude of General von Falkenhayn towards the question of continuing the land war, it is explained that he met the requests of the leaders in the East for the provision of considerable fresh forces, especially the new formations in the homeland, with strong reluctance around the turn of 1914/15. Even if the result of previous operations on the Eastern Front, despite brilliant partial successes of the Commander-in-Chief East, had to be described as insufficient when measured against the goals of decisive warfare, there was still no justification for such far-reaching conclusions as the Chief of the General Staff drew in his response to a new proposal by General von Wild with the words that \"we will not achieve a complete military overthrow of Russia.\" Such a radical statement was only explicable from fundamental considerations about the unusually great difficulties that arose from the nature of the immeasurably vast Russian theater of war, given the existing strength ratios and the constantly threatening danger in the West of any decision-seeking offensive. It cannot be denied that General von Falkenhayn both with his assessment of the scale of forces required for decisive operations in the East and with his estimation of the possibilities and prospects of success offered by the planned undertakings in the Carpathians and in Masuria, in view of the reinforcements demanded and then granted for them, proved to be right against the high expectations to which the leaders in the East initially succumbed.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) von Falkenhayn, a. a.

His sound sense of reality did not promise any far-reaching and decisive results from these offensives from the outset, but only \"greater local successes\" with the effect of putting the Russians \"in such a position that they would not be able to become dangerous to us in the foreseeable future.\" In the long run, however, he could not escape the weight of the reasons that particularly led the Commander-in-Chief East to argue for the absolute necessity of a thorough improvement of the situation in the East. For ultimately, the Chief of the General Staff himself probably felt the weakness of his only vote, that the provision of the newly formed army reserves \"was equivalent to renouncing any offensive activity in the West for the foreseeable future with all its serious consequences\"2). Whether any specific plan was envisaged by him for such \"offensive activity in the West\" cannot be said. A (not dispatched) letter to the Commander-in-Chief East from the last days of December 1914 merely stated in general terms that \"the war situation in the West required a transition to vigorous offensive by the end of January at the latest.\" He no longer believed he \"could expect the troops to endure life in the trenches and passive behavior there.\"\nFrom the end of February 1915, however, there was a change in General von Falkenhayn's assessment of the overall war situation. The significant increase in combat units, which the formation of 14 new divisional associations on the Western Front meant, revived in him, after the defensive victory in Champagne, a renewed belief in the possibility of a decisive success in the war.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "183": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Es h\u00e4lt schwer, f\u00fcr diese\".

Russia, however, was hardly considered by him as a field for far-reaching, decisive operations now and in the future. But at the Western Front, always regarded as the main theater of war, a breakthrough operation aimed at deciding the war seemed conceivable to him. From all the considerations, calculations, and explorations made on this, the \"Strike on Amiens,\" already considered earlier, emerged as the most promising plan by mid-March. He eagerly immersed himself in the preparations and, despite the increased political uncertainty due to Italy's entry into the war, he remained committed to breaking through the enemy's defensive system north of the Somme between Arras and Albert on a front width of about 25 kilometers and then causing the northern connection front to collapse. Not with a light heart, but with remarkable agility in decision-making and quick adaptability to the changed situation, he took indefinite leave of this breakthrough plan at the beginning of April, as the ever-increasing threat to the often Austrian-Hungarian ally on the Carpathian Front forced the deployment of the majority of the army reserves on Galician soil. However, the renunciation was not to be final; the Chief of the General Staff hoped, after quickly executing the operational strike in the East, limited by force, space, and time, to still come to decisive action in the West in the foreseeable future.\nMeanwhile, the unexpected expansion and growing importance of the Galician campaign shifted the focus of warfare so strongly to the East during the following months that pure defense once again became the exclusive, albeit brilliantly solved, task of the Western Front, stripped to the limits of possibility. On the other hand, operations in Galicia could only be continued because General von Falkenhayn managed to convince the Austrian-Hungarian Chief of the General Staff of the necessity to confront the new enemy Italy with a minimum number of forces in strong defense right at the national border. How much, indeed, during this period General von Falkenhayn's desire for offensive activity on the Western Front remained active is evidenced by his intention to immediately return five corps from the victorious pursuit after the capture of Lemberg to the West. Three of them he intended to use for the \"cleansing of Upper Alsace,\" the others for relief purposes at a previously hard-pressed front section in Artvis.

Although even here a secure proof is not possible, the simplest explanation for the intention to clear Upper Alsace will probably be seen as the clearly recognizable urging of the Chief of the General Staff at this time for the initiation of an early peace, whereby it could be of value that the enemy retains a piece of German soil as a pawn. This interpretation gains in probability when one considers the idea he had formed of the constantly declining resistance strength and the limited endurance of the French people. He indulged in the hope that the French government would soon be determined whether the abandonment of resistance would be more beneficial to the future of the nation than the continuation of the hopeless war for France despite all foreign aid. Perhaps General von Falkenhayn believed at this time that the desired goal could also be achieved without a decisive blow in France.\nWith the fading of the supposed peace possibilities, the Chief of the General Staff quickly abandoned the intention to weaken the Eastern Army in favor of the Western Army and wholeheartedly joined the plans of Colonel General von Conrad and Field Marshal von Mackensen aimed at expanding the operational goals. However, even in this, he remained mindful of limiting the increased deployment of forces in time and preventing an extension of the campaign \"into the boundless.\" His sole concern was to achieve as much weakening of the Russian army's striking power as possible, so that sufficient rear security for the decisive final battle in the West was achieved for some time. Nevertheless, the successful progress of the campaign against Russia resulted in a certain change in the ideas about the limitation of operational goals in the East. At the end of July, there was even a brief moment when the Chief of the General Staff, under the impression of the successes of the long attack in the area between Narew, Vistula, and Bug, believed that the previously unattainable goal of the military overthrow of Russia had come within reach.\nAs soon as it became apparent, however, that such an effect could not be expected from the ongoing operations, his warfare, along with the rejection of the offensive against the northern flank and into the rear of the Russians, as emphatically demanded by the Commander-in-Chief East, clearly revealed the endeavor to put a stop as soon as possible to the more or less frontal pursuit running along the entire front, in order to once bring aid to the hard-pressed Turkey at the Dardanelles by opening the Danube route blocked by Serbia, but above all to return strong forces to the western theater of war and to carry out the decisive battle planned in the spring.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>einmal der an den Dardanellen hart bedr\u00e4ngten T\u00fcrkei durch \u00d6ffnung des von Serbien gesperrten Donau-Weges Hilfe zu bringen, vor allem aber starke Kr\u00e4fte auf den westlichen Kriegsschauplatz zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren und hier den schon im Fr\u00fchjahr geplanten Entscheidungskampf auszutragen.</fragment_2>", "185": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Bei der Durchf\u00fchrung der Balkan-Offensive hielt der Generalstabschef streng daran fest, da\u00df starke deutsche Kr\u00e4fte nur vor\u00fcbergehend auf einem Nebenkriegsschauplatz festgelegt werden durften.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"Bereits Anfang Oktober sah er die Lage an der Westfront wieder als so weit gefestigt an, da\u00df er sich mit der Absicht trug, nach Eintreffen weiterer Verst\u00e4rkungen aus dem Osten die Initiative an sich zu rei\u00dfen.\"\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` is a complete sentence, ending with a period, indicating it is a coherent thought.\n- `fragment_2` begins a new thought and does not logically or grammatically continue `fragment_1`.\n- The fragments are independent and do not logically or grammatically connect into a single sentence.\n</thinking>\n\n<fragment_1>Bei der Durchf\u00fchrung der Balkan-Offensive hielt der Generalstabschef streng daran fest, da\u00df starke deutsche Kr\u00e4fte nur vor\u00fcbergehend auf einem Nebenkriegsschauplatz festgelegt werden durften.</fragment_1>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>\n\n<decision>The fragments do not align and do not form a single coherent sentence.</decision>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>655</pageno>\n<header>The Summer of 1915.</header>\n<body>once to bring aid to Turkey, hard-pressed at the Dardanelles, by opening the Danube route blocked by Serbia, but above all to return strong forces to the western theater of war and to carry out the decisive battle planned for the spring. At the end of July, the head of the field railway system, Major General Groener, noted in his private diary: \"They (i.e., Falkenhayn and Tappen) want to be content with the defensive on the Bug line, in order to then bring their ten corps to break through to the west. Falkenhayn always returns to this idea.\" The Chief of the General Staff also hoped to conduct and complete the campaign against Serbia, for which the East was to give up its forces, so quickly that the great decisive blow on French soil could still fall in 1915. The breakthrough point also seemed to have been envisaged as the front north of the Somme, predominantly occupied by the English. A preceding attack in Upper Alsace was to act as a diversion.\nHowever, as delays occurred at the beginning of the Serbian campaign and General von Falkenhayn, contrary to these plans, allowed operations in the East to be further extended and in part to take other paths than he had originally desired and expected, by the end of August/September there could be no doubt that the time for the breakthrough in the West was receding into the distance. The return of all forces in the East, which became dispensable after the conclusion of the local offensive, to the Western Front would take so much time that the breakthrough operation could hardly have begun before the onset of winter. The severe crisis, which at the end of September was brought about by the unforeseen enemy double attack in Champagne and Artois by General von Falkenhayn, then postponed all the foundations of the plan by months. For a time, it was even seriously questioned whether it could still be considered for implementation. General von Falkenhayn was not deprived of his often-tested nerve strength and calm by the blows of fate. It was due to him, with his often-tested nerve strength, despite the aggravated situation on the Western Front, to remain faithful to the decision made shortly before, to increase the German strength offer for the Serbian campaign as required by the unexpectedly occurred shortfall in the contribution of forces by the ally. In carrying out the Balkan offensive, the Chief of the General Staff strictly adhered to the fact that strong German forces could only be temporarily fixed on a secondary theater of war.</body>\n<footer>1) Volume VIII, p. 343, note.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>", "186": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Frei-\".

Naturally, this could not involve the unleashing of new major battles with decisive offensive objectives for the foreseeable future. The heavy losses suffered by the enemy in their unsuccessful breakthrough attempts also gave pause for thought. The Chief of the General Staff began to seriously doubt whether it was even possible to break through an unshakable, heavily fortified defensive front. Thus, in early October, an inquiry was directed to the High Command of the Army Group German Crown Prince, asking whether it would not be advisable to \"resume the old plan and carry out the operation in Alsace,\" aside from political considerations, which certainly also played a role this time, probably more in the sense of a local retaliatory strike for the recent territorial losses in Champagne and Artois. It seemed logical not to conduct such an operation at the previous main focal points of the battles, where the enemy still had very strong forces available for immediate deployment, but rather to exploit preparations already made on the extreme left flank of the army, where an attack could also bring the advantage of ending the impending winter's very difficult mountain battles in the southern arc. The idea may also have been to push the French back to the Reich border to create a favorable starting position for larger future operations. From the discussions with the army group, a firm decision had formed by early December to initiate the decisive battle on the Western Front in the coming spring with an attack from Sundgau towards Belfort in conjunction with operations at other locations. When shortly thereafter the direction threatening France much more sensitively towards Verdun was chosen, it was merely in the belief that the initial strike could be given even greater impact.\nReviewing General von Falkenhayn's military conduct up to the end of 1915, especially the considerations and decisions underlying it, it becomes clear that he repeatedly returned to his idea pursued during the first phase of the war of forcing a decision on land against the Western powers under the completely changed conditions of trench warfare.

The first deep incision lies in the winter of 1914/15 after the final failure of the attack in Flanders. During this period, the idea of the superior effectiveness of the British starvation and attrition plan pushes the defensive demand for \"cautious management of resources\" so strongly to the forefront of overall war strategy that there is no room for the idea of initiating decisive offensive operations on one's own initiative. It is only in the spring of 1915 that this idea revives with the increased mobilization of military resources. It finds expression in the plan for a breakthrough on the Western Front. General von Falkenhayn adheres to this indication even in the summer and autumn during the gradually expanding offensive operations in Galicia and Russia, albeit not without fluctuations. The intention of a \"cleansing of Upper Alsace,\" which apparently arises from political considerations after the capture of Lemberg, signifies only a brief intellectual interlude that remains without impact on the progress of military actions. On the contrary, the further expansion of operations against Russia pushes the timing of the breakthrough in the West into the distance. The autumn crisis on the western theater of war temporarily questions the feasibility of the entire plan. After overcoming it, the will to fight decisively against the Western powers gradually regains vitality. However, the operational form in which it is to be expressed has changed: The own breakthrough through the enemy front, whether British or French, is rejected as an introductory act. Through this breakthrough at a vital point for the French, a grueling major battle is to be unleashed without the pursuit of operationally exploitable territorial gains. This, the Chief of General Staff hopes, will lead to counterattacks by the enemy at other points as well, loosening the frozen fronts of trench warfare and enabling the transition to mobile warfare through decisive breakthroughs.\nA critical assessment of General von Falkenhayn's conduct of the war in the period discussed here must begin with the determination of what was understood by \"war decision\" from the standpoint of the Central Powers against the ring of hostile coalition. For Germany and Austria-Hungary, a success could only be considered decisive if it forced an opponent to withdraw or at least completely neutralized them as a military power factor, without which the hostile coalition could not continue the war with any prospect of success.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Ausscheiden zwang oder mindestens als milit\u00e4rischen Machtfaktor v\u00f6llig ausschaltete, ohne den die feindliche Koalition den Krieg mit Aussicht auf Erfolg nicht weiter zu f\u00fchren vermochte.</fragment_2>", "188": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Der solchem Verfahren\".

It is obvious that successes in the Balkans or against Italy, however desirable they might be, could never have decisive significance for the war. They were defensive victories to secure the overall situation, at best steps to prepare for the decisive battle. Among the three main opponents of the Central Powers, England was the one whose elimination promised to have the strongest influence on the outcome of the war by rendering it defenseless. A coalition deprived of England's assistance and thus mainly limited to France and Russia was hardly capable of winning the war. A coalition of England-France without Russia remained indisputably much more capable of war than a coalition of England-Russia without France.\nGeneral von Falkenhayn had already correctly recognized in the autumn of 1914 that England was the strongest power factor of the enemy alliance, the soul of its resistance. The German naval command saw the decisive battle at sea during this period as hopeless due to the unfavorable balance of power for Germany. For the German land warfare, however, it was an utterly insoluble task to strike at the roots of England's power so strongly without the cooperation of the naval forces that it had to withdraw as an active member from the enemy coalition of powers. The highest achievement was reached when it succeeded in inflicting the greatest damage on England by destroying its army stationed on the mainland. Such a blow could, however, be elevated to a decisive one if it was accompanied by the disarmament of France. Then there was a justified prospect of finally becoming master of the third main opponent, Russia, provided that a decisive military engagement against it was still necessary at all.\nThe possibility of successfully conducting the war according to this fundamental idea was, after the failure of the Marne campaign, although already considerably restricted, not yet completely ruled out. With the transition to trench warfare on the Western Fronts in late autumn 1914, however, all the prerequisites on which the previous war plan had been based ended fundamentally. Decisive was above all the changed role that had to be assigned to the fight against Russia within the framework of the overall war effort. The Russian army had to be halted under all circumstances with a minimum of forces, which, according to the experiences made by the Austro-Hungarian army, was no longer in question. The trench warfare suitable for such a procedure had only begun late on the eastern front, and the defense could not be assigned sustainable strength on the vast, only weakly developed fronts to the same extent as in the West.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>sich dienliche Stellungskrieg hatte auf dem \u00f6stlichen Kriegsschauplatz erst sp\u00e4t eingesetzt, und der Verteidigung konnte auf den weitgedehnten, nur schwach ausgebauten Fronten nachhaltige Kraft nicht in demselben Ma\u00dfe zugesprochen werden wie im Westen.</fragment_2>", "189": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Wenn im Frieden bei der Aufstellung der Wehrkraft\".

The imminent collapse of the ally would have been the inevitable consequence. The East, even if it was to remain a secondary theater as before, imperatively demanded increased deployment of forces. If the Russians were to be brought to a halt by powerful offensive strikes and pushed back into defense, as actually happened on a large part of the front in the winter of 1914 with success, this meant a commitment and deployment of such strong forces that a breakthrough in the West and its operational exploitation was simply not possible. The plan of General von Falkenhayn, nevertheless, to resume the decisive battle against the Western powers in the spring of 1915 with the help of the 14 newly formed divisions, can hardly be granted retrospective criticism in view of the strength ratios existing on the Western Front at that time and the inadequate ammunition situation, even if one considers that there was also a pressing shortage of ammunition on the enemy side. The then Chief of Field Ammunition, General of Artillery a. D. Sieger, stated: \"The Chief of Field Ammunition was not aware of any of these plans, otherwise he could have certainly proven that the ammunition situation in the spring of 1915 absolutely ruled out a large-scale offensive in the West. In the defense of the French spring offensive in Champagne, the laboriously accumulated reserves were almost completely depleted.\" But also the view of the Chief of General Staff, that it would suffice for carrying out the decisive battle in the West if beforehand through attacks with limited objectives \"the offensive power of the Russian army would be paralyzed for the foreseeable future,\" was based on deception insofar as the size and duration of this decisive battle in the West with a temporal limitation of the indispensable back-up in the East was not sufficiently taken into account. A war decision against the Western powers under the aggravating conditions of trench warfare could only be forced if Russia was also eliminated as a power factor, that is, the Russian army was so decisively defeated that complete freedom of movement in the East was achieved. The previous secondary theater had to be made the main theater of war for a long time by exploiting the advantage offered by the conduct of war on the inner line, purposefully and with significantly increased deployment of forces.

Such a procedure was now less likely and also more difficult, as the Russian army was in close contact and combat with its opponents along its entire front. It seemed quite ready to seek the decision in the attack. Moreover, it was the art of leadership on the part of the Central Powers to plan operations in such a way that a most decisive result was in prospect, even if the enemy, under the impression of unfortunate partial battles, should try to evade the decision.\nGeneral von Falkenhayn had quite accurate ideas about the need for strength and time required to manage this enormous task. However, it remains questionable whether he was right to fundamentally reject the idea. Realization was conceivable only with a significant weakening of the Western army in favor of the Eastern army. If one decided to do this while maintaining the previously extended front, there was a risk of succumbing to the breakthrough attempts of the French and English, which would certainly begin. An unavoidable requirement was therefore a significant shortening of the front. It had to be prepared according to a carefully worked-out plan before stronger forces were sent to the East, so that, as soon as an enemy attack began, one could systematically evade in a sufficient manner. Since, for relevant reasons, Belgium, especially the Flemish coast, could not be abandoned, the extreme limit for such a backward relocation of the front was approximately the line Nieuport\u2014Lille\u2014Maubeuge\u2014Metz\u2014Strasbourg\u2014Upper Rhine. The saved forces, perhaps a dozen corps, were only gradually freed after thorough expansion of the new positions. Thus, a decisive offensive in the East could only be launched after some time. Until then, the task of warfare there was merely to maintain or restore the operational balance.\nFor the success of such a large undertaking, it was also an indispensable prerequisite that, within the framework of extensive mobilization of domestic manpower for the war effort, labor for position construction was provided and deployed to a much greater extent than in the first two years of the war.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "191": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Es ist gewi\u00df kein Zufall, da\u00df der Generalstabschef gerade in den Tagen, da er sich eingehend mit der entscheidenden Frage gestellt sah, auf welche Weise und auf welchem Wege k\u00fcnftig die Kriegsentscheidung zu suchen sei, an Feldmarschall\"\n\n<fragment_1>Es ist gewi\u00df kein Zufall, da\u00df der Generalstabschef gerade in den Tagen, da er sich eingehend mit der entscheidenden Frage gestellt sah, auf welche Weise und auf welchem Wege k\u00fcnftig die Kriegsentscheidung zu suchen sei, an Feldmarschall</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"von der Goltz die Worte schrieb): \u201eWenn auch noch viele Lehren aus diesem Feldzuge unbewiesen sein m\u00f6gen, eine ist \u00fcber jeden Zweifel erhaben, n\u00e4mlich diese: Halte, was du hast, und gib nie einen Fu\u00dfbreit von dem auf, was du gewannst.

This would have been around the same \ntime he actually began to set a far-reaching goal for operations in the east \nbeyond previous intentions. Although the actual situation in July 1915 did \nnot rule out the possibility of concluding the campaign against Russia with \ngreater operational success than was achieved, if the Chief of the General \nStaff had at that time decided in a timely manner on the operation proposed \nby the Commander-in-Chief East against the enemy's right flank and rear \nand simultaneous advances of strong forces beyond the Bug. However, a \nsecure basis for envisaging the overthrow of the Russian army with \nprospects of full success could only have been created if the supreme \ncommand had long worked towards it with a clearly thought-out war \nplan, making the maximum possible deployment of forces available for \nthe long term and unconcerned about the development of the situation in \nthe west.\nIt should certainly not be overlooked that such a radical decision would \nhave placed the highest conceivable demands on the willpower and tension \nof the commander and the dedicated performance capability of the troops. \nMoreover, it was not just about purely military considerations, but equally \nabout political, economic, and not least psychological questions of great \nimportance. However, this does not mean that the decision would have \nresulted in more severe tests of endurance than those actually undertaken \nand successfully passed by command and troops at that time without such \na large goal in the background. Nevertheless, such a decision was not at \nall an option for General von Falkenhayn. For it contradicted his entire \nviewpoint, which was also fully shared by many leaders of the Western \nArmy, against one of the most important principles according to which he \nwas willing to conduct the war, which had degenerated into a struggle for \nterritorial possession, at the Western Front for the embattled and determined \nCentral Powers. It is certainly no coincidence that the Chief of the General \nStaff, precisely in the days when he was thoroughly addressing the decisive \nquestion of how and by what means the future decision of the war should \nbe sought, turned to Field Marshal von der Goltz and wrote the words: \"Even if many lessons from this campaign may remain unproven, one is beyond any doubt, namely this: Hold what you have, and never give up an inch of what you have gained.

The Year 1916.\nA decisive influence on the plan that General von Falkenhayn based his further warfare on, after the brilliant offensive successes in Russia and the Balkans and the equally admirable defensive victories on French soil, was the entirely accurate idea taken from Clausewitz's world of thought that in this greatest of all wars, through the utmost exertion of power by all participating states and peoples, \"the absolute form\" of the war was expressed in a size and destructive power never seen before. To make a fundamental commitment to such a view, General von Falkenhayn emphasized sharply and emphatically to the political Reich leadership on November 29, 1915, that in this \"struggle for existence in the true sense,\" Germany and its allies had no other choice but to \"continue the war, even at the risk of having to deploy the last man and the last penny, until the will of the enemies to win and thus also to endure the war is broken. \"We are forced to follow this path to the good or bitter end, whether we want to or not.\"\nThe draft of this letter also contained the sentence that particularly characterized General von Falkenhayn's way of thinking: \"Such battles are not decided by the gain of battles or foreign territories in themselves, but solely by the fact that the enemy is deprived of any hope of achieving his purpose through the entirety of military actions.\"\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Gegner durch die Gesamtheit der Kriegshandlungen jede Hoffnung ent\u00adrissen wird, seinen Zweck zu erreichen\u201c.</fragment_2>", "193": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"w\u00e4hrend die von ihm geleiteten Landoperationen auf dem westlichen Kriegsschauplatz unter Zusammenfassung aller irgend ver\u00adf\u00fcgbar zu machenden deutschen Streitkr\u00e4fte und Kampfmittel Englands bestes Festlandschwert, das franz\u00f6sische Heer, zerbrechen und dar\u00fcber hin\u00adaus nach M\u00f6glichkeit auch eine schwere Niederlage des englischen Heeres selbst herbeif\u00fchren sollten, fiel der Seemacht die Aufgabe zu, durch Wieder-\".

He believed that Russia, after the severe failures of the past year, would be forced to relent due to its internal difficulties in a relatively short time\u00b9), and the faster, the more any attempts to restore its \"military reputation\" would be thwarted. He assessed the internal conditions of Italy as such that they would soon make the active continuation of the war impossible, provided the Austro-Hungarian army continued to perform its duty to some extent\u00b2). According to him, France's military and economic capacity had already been weakened by the course of the war \"to the brink of tolerability\"\u00b3), and the secondary theaters of war in the Balkans and on the Asian borders of the Turkish Empire seemed to have eliminated any serious threat to Germany and its allies. Only the main and arch-enemy England remained unshaken. Its confidence in forcing the Quadruple Alliance to its knees through a war of attrition had not yet been broken. The fundamental idea of further warfare should therefore be to \"demonstrate to England the hopelessness of its undertaking\"\u2074). However, the Chief of the General Staff did not conceal the fact that the ability to hold out on one's own was \"limited among the allies,\" while in Germany itself it was \"still unlimited.\" Thus, the overall situation urgently called for a quick decision in the war. Germany, in its well-considered own interest, took the initiative.\nTwo means \u2014 army and navy \u2014 were what General von Falkenhayn believed could achieve the high goal he envisioned through their cooperation. He had full authority over only one of them; he could only influence the application of the other in an encouraging and demanding manner. While the land operations he directed on the western front, by consolidating all available German forces and resources, were to break England's best mainland sword, the French army, and, if possible, also bring about a severe defeat of the English army itself, the navy was tasked with resuming unrestricted submarine warfare to damage the island nation so severely that it would be inclined towards peace in the foreseeable future, by the end of 1916.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) p. 9.\n\u00b2) p. 7.\n\u00b3) p. 10.\n\u2074) p. 3.\n\u2075) Ibid.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>aufnahme des Unterseekrieges in seiner uneingeschr\u00e4nkten Form das Insel\u00advolk so schwer zu sch\u00e4digen, da\u00df es in absehbarer Zeit, bis Ende des Jahres 1916, friedensgeneigt w\u00fcrde.</fragment_2>", "194": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Hier\".

It was the first time that the leader of the land war sought to intervene decisively in the conduct of the naval war with demanding language. For the solution of the task assigned to the navy, he considered the German forces, with the strongest restriction on the fronts of the East and Balkans, to be sufficient; in the matter of submarine warfare, he relied on the expert judgment of the responsible men of the navy.\nThe plan of General von Falkenhayn completely failed. As much as retrospective consideration requires caution and restraint in judgment, it must still be stated that the plan had little chance of success because the tension between desire and reality was too great. Almost all the assumptions from which the Chief of the General Staff proceeded in assessing the enemies were incorrect. Neither Russia nor Italy was on the verge of dropping out as active members of the enemy alliance due to internal difficulties. On the contrary, despite the severe defeats of the previous year, Russia still demonstrated so much offensive power that it brought the front of the Austro-Hungarian army to collapse over wide stretches. Italy not only withstood the Tyrolean defensive operations but also concluded the sixth Isonzo offensive with a visible military success for the first time. France stood firm at the beginning of the strongest ordeal it had faced since the start of trench warfare and was also able to actively participate in the offensive of its British ally, which, thanks to its inexhaustible influx of power, dominated the field at the Somme. However, the unrestricted submarine warfare, which General von Falkenhayn had described as the \"presumably most effective means of war,\" was not implemented at all. Nevertheless, even if it had been conducted with all the force possible from mid-March, it is seriously to be assumed that, given the small number of available frontline boats, it could have achieved the hoped-for result within the estimated period until the end of the year \u2014 quite apart from the incalculable implications of the inevitable entry of the United States of America into the ranks of the opponents.\n\"War is the realm of uncertainty,\" says Clausewitz. Three-quarters of the things on which actions in war are based lie in the fog of more or less great uncertainty.

It is always only a sensing and discerning of the truth, according to which one must act.\nIt certainly cannot be denied that the foundations on which General von Falkenhayn built his plan belonged to those things so shrouded in the fog of uncertainty that even a fine, penetrating intellect had to overcome particular difficulties to sense and discern the truth with the tact of its judgment. Nevertheless, it cannot be claimed that the Chief of the General Staff could derive sufficient justifications from the previous course of the war for the conclusions he drew from his assessment of the current situation and made the basis of his future plans. For the notion that Russia and Italy no longer counted as threatening power factors, that they would, for internal political reasons, effectively take themselves out of action in the foreseeable future, that it was even expedient from the standpoint of the Central Powers not to disturb these impending dissolution processes through offensive pressure, there was at least a lack of compelling evidence. Also, France's previous achievements and sacrifices, incidentally ruthlessly acknowledged by General von Falkenhayn, hardly allowed for such a far-reaching conclusion as he drew with the assertion that it required only one last, utmost exertion of strength from the German side to bring the French people to collapse. It almost seems that he attributed weight to some reports from the intelligence service, which may have been correct in detail, through generalizing and thus erroneous conclusions, which they did not deserve upon unbiased examination. With the unrestricted submarine war, the commander included a factor in his overall calculation about whose effectiveness and success possibilities he initially harbored certain doubts himself. One must probably say that he then too easily and willingly warmed to an idea that was as eagerly advocated by the navy as it was effectively opposed by the political Reich leadership. Thus, it came about that the Chancellor, with the approval of the Supreme War Lord, could defeat the responsible leaders of the war effort on their own field not only with political but also with military reasons. In the end, this resulted in the peculiar spectacle that not even the Chief of the Admiralty Staff, but only the head of the land war, albeit unsuccessfully, insisted on a demand whose fulfillment, upon cool consideration of all pros and cons, offered no sufficient guarantee for achieving the desired goal, but rather threatened to significantly worsen the overall situation.\n</body>\n<footer>1) p. 15.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Erf\u00fcllung bei k\u00fchler Abw\u00e4gung alles F\u00fcr und Wider keine hinl\u00e4ngliche Gew\u00e4hr f\u00fcr die Erreichung des erstrebten Zieles bot, wohl aber eine wesentliche Verschlechterung der Gesamtlage nach sich zu ziehen drohte.</fragment_2>", "196": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is:\n\"neben einem durchaus unerw\u00fcnschten Erscheinungsbild der politischen Lage,\"\n\n<fragment_1>neben einem durchaus unerw\u00fcnschten Erscheinungsbild der politischen Lage,</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `<german_page_2>`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is:\n\"sie die Aufrollung der rum\u00e4nischen Frage bedeuten konnte, auf lange Zeit hinaus eine Zersplitterung der Gesamtkr\u00e4fte zur Folge haben w\u00fcrden.\"\n\n<fragment_2>sie die Aufrollung der rum\u00e4nischen Frage bedeuten konnte, auf lange Zeit hinaus eine Zersplitterung der Gesamtkr\u00e4fte zur Folge haben w\u00fcrden.</fragment_2>\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` ends with a comma, indicating it is incomplete.\n- `fragment_2` begins with \"sie,\" which can logically and grammatically continue from `fragment_1`.\n- Combining them forms a coherent sentence: \"neben einem durchaus unerw\u00fcnschten Erscheinungsbild der politischen Lage, sie die Aufrollung der rum\u00e4nischen Frage bedeuten konnte, auf lange Zeit hinaus eine Zersplitterung der Gesamtkr\u00e4fte zur Folge haben w\u00fcrden.\"\n- This sentence is coherent and grammatically correct.\n\n<decision>The fragments align and form a coherent sentence.</decision>\n</thinking>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>666</pageno>\n<header>Review of the Warfare of General von Falkenhayn.</header>\n<body>In the cool weighing of all pros and cons, there was no sufficient \nguarantee for achieving the desired goal, but rather a \nsignificant deterioration of the overall situation threatened to ensue. Despite \nall appreciation for the spirit of decisive and responsible \ninitiative that characterized General von Falkenhayn's planning around the \nturn of 1915/16, one cannot escape the impression that \nit was largely guided by wishes and hopes, \nwhich found no adequate support in the actual circumstances. Wishful thinking clouded the view of reality. The \nconsiderable size and difficulty of the impending task were not fully recognized.\nAs easy as it is to critically review and expose the sources of error in Falkenhayn's plan based on historical \nevents, it is equally difficult to show an alternative path that, given the situation as it was \naround the turn of 1915/16, offered more prospects for success. Even then, amidst the war events, \nvarious proposals were made to the German Chief of General Staff, \nand professional criticism has continued to strive to find more promising solutions to this day. They all rest on the indisputably \ncorrect realization that the difficult task of the decisive battle \non the Western Front could only be managed if, in addition to the \nwar effort on other fronts, the situation was sufficiently cleared so that the \nforces required for the final battle were freely available.

Indeed, General von Falkenhayn overlooked in the plan of Generaloberst von Conrad that a quickly and surprisingly conducted attack against Italy with the concentration of superior forces had considerable significance in terms of final war decision, as it not only created the best flank protection for a subsequent offensive on French soil at a particularly important point of the overall front for the Central Powers, but also enabled the participation of stronger Austro-Hungarian forces or at least \u2014 with appropriate troop exchange on the Eastern Front \u2014 a significant increase in the German force deployment. A serious threat to the German Western Front by the French and English during the probably only short time-consuming attack against the Italians was hardly to be feared with careful force distribution, although it must not be overlooked that the weather conditions in the mountains did not allow major combat operations before spring, so the Western powers retained freedom of action for a longer time. Determined to support the Italians incessantly, this came at the expense of their forces stationed in France and Belgium. However, what remained for the Central Powers in such an interlocking of operations on the Southwest and Western Fronts in any case in undiminished severity was the uncertainty of the situation in the East. The lack of rear freedom, which had not been achieved in the past year, posed serious dangers for the undisturbed execution of any certainly lengthy and resource-consuming offensive operation on the unified front from the Adriatic to the Channel. This could only be countered by leaving strong German troops in the East; they were absent for the decisive battle in the West. That this could then achieve the desired final goal is doubtful.\nAs for the attack on Salonika, it must be considered that the prospect of achieving an operational, political, and morally valuable military success there through quick action never existed. It could only be a matter of a systematically and thoroughly prepared approach, about whose considerable difficulties and long duration the sober and factual reporting of the Mackensen Army Group left no doubt. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that a successful execution of this operation would have timely eliminated the power center forming there, which for the time being did not yet seriously appear, but did show as a source of future dangers that required attention.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Gefahren Beachtung hie\u00dfchte.</fragment_2>", "198": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Es leuchtet daher ohne weiteres ein, da\u00df der Feldzug in die Ukraine, aus der doppelten Grundstellung von Wolhynien\u2013Galizien und vom Balkan her in die\".

Looking back, one may say that the execution of the attack on Salonika, even if it occurred simultaneously with an offensive against Italy, would not have exceeded the capacity of the Quadruple Alliance. A disarmament of the enemies was hardly to be hoped for. In general, the immediate military benefit that the eventual capture of Salonika would have brought to the overall situation should not be overestimated. Certainly, however, the expulsion of the enemies from the Balkans would have meant a similarly great, if not even greater, moral success as their withdrawal from Gallipoli. Such an outcome could have had a decisive influence on Romania's stance.\nThe question of how to proceed with Romania was of incomparably greater importance than the question of the attack on Salonika. Its prompt unification, whether by amicable means or by force, meant an improvement in the overall military situation in any case, whether the focus of warfare lay in the East or the West. If Romania could not be persuaded to join, the overthrow of its untested army by strategic surprise with the forces available in the Southeast in the winter of 1915/16 would have been achievable in a short time. But even in this case, it was a secondary theater of war within the overall conception of General von Falkenhayn. Since the food situation at home was essentially based on uninterrupted supply from there, it is understandable that he was easily willing to forgo the resolution of the matter.\nClosely related to the Romanian question is the idea of the campaign into Ukraine, as the acquisition or overthrow of Romania had to be at its beginning. The Ukraine campaign promised decisive impact on the course of the war because it was the best means to defeat Russia not only militarily but also to break its economic backbone. If successful, the main mass of the army would be free for deployment on the western front. Furthermore, the timely acquisition of the economic resources of the Black Earth country and Romania provided assistance for the endurance of the Quadruple Alliance that could not be overestimated. It promised to mitigate the effects of the British hunger blockade, perhaps even gradually offsetting them. It is therefore immediately apparent that the campaign into Ukraine, from the dual base of Volhynia\u2013Galicia and from the Balkans in the direction of Kiev and Odessa, represented an extraordinarily difficult and time-consuming undertaking that required extensive and thorough preparations over a long period.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>tung auf Kiew und Odessa gef\u00fchrt, ein au\u00dferordentlich schwieriges und zeitraubendes Unternehmen bedeutete, das umfangreicher und gr\u00fcndlicher Vorbereitungen von langer Hand bedurfte.</fragment_2>", "199": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"F\u00fcr ihn hatte das ganze schwierige Problem des Mehrfrontenkrieges dahin einfach, da\u00df es \u2014 bei Abwehr auf allen Nebenfronten \u2014 nur noch\".

Although the necessary deployment of forces could have been largely met by the troops stationed on the Eastern Front and the Balkans in December 1915, thus avoiding significant demands on the Western Front, quick initial successes were possible. However, the further execution of the offensive had to contend with inadequate connections and unfavorable railway conditions, as well as difficulties in bridging large rivers, which would certainly result in a sluggish progression. An essential prerequisite was therefore that the attacker had ample time for the preparation and conduct of the campaign. Since this prerequisite was not met in the situation that arose towards the end of 1915, it was hardly possible to rectify it. For, as inconvenient as a new German offensive against Russia would have been for the opponents, as we know today, they would have certainly stormed the Western Front, and whether it could withstand in the long run, if it had to rely on its own forces, must be questioned. In any case, the campaign in Ukraine under the prevailing conditions was such a far-reaching and thus daring undertaking for the overall situation of Germany and the Quadruple Alliance that even a commander of unusual daring could hardly take responsibility for it. It is understandable that General von Falkenhayn was not willing to do so.\nOnce again, the immense tension and dangerous interplay to which the Quadruple Alliance's warfare was subjected in fighting on various fronts came to light. Once again, however, the decisive advantage became apparent, which they could have drawn from a long-planned shortening of the defensive front in the West for the overall situation until the point where a justified prospect opened up to bring the decisive battle on French soil with sufficiently strong forces to fruition. What had been neglected in this regard since late autumn 1914 now weighed heavily as an obstacle on the decision-making and freedom of action of the German army leadership.\nHowever, General von Falkenhayn did not perceive this obstacle, nor could he perceive it in the mindset in which he lived. For him, the entire difficult problem of the multi-front war was simply that \u2014 with defense on all secondary fronts \u2014 only to strike and weaken the Western powers, particularly England, so strongly that they became inclined towards peace.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>darauf anfam, die Westm\u00e4chte, insbesondere England, so stark zu treffen und zu schw\u00e4chen, da\u00df sie friedensgeneigt wurden.</fragment_2>", "200": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"In ihrer Mitte f\u00fchlen sich solche Naturen...\".

He was well aware that this would still cost a lot of hard work, but he trusted in the inner quality of the German army, which, although numerically inferior to the opponents, had so far proven equal to every test of its performance. It remains puzzling, however, that he refrained from any influence on the tactical training of the troops for the many new and unfamiliar offensive tasks ahead of them, even if only by issuing uniform combat regulations. It is noteworthy that during the months-long battle for Verdun, only a single brief instruction of this kind was issued by the Supreme Army Command on April 14. It concerned the combating of machine gun nests. Even in all purely technical questions of warfare, whose scope and significance constantly grew, the Chief of the General Staff sometimes held back conspicuously.\nThe same strong confidence he placed in his war tools filled him with confidence in his own abilities. \"If fate has imposed such a heavy and exalted office on me, very much against my will,\" he wrote in those critical days, \"he truly does not fear earthly responsibility. My conscience and my will are the only guiding stars on my thorny path.\" Undeniably, he was a man distinguished by richness of thought and acumen, to whom a certain genius cannot be denied, perhaps one of the most imaginative minds of the army at that time. His lively imagination gave rise to a \"wealth of visions\" that strongly occupied his mind and rarely allowed him to come to rest in truly great decisions. He had ideas that many others did not come to even with the most intense immersion in the material. In doing so, he was a sanguine nature and as such equally susceptible to imaginative elevation as to spiritual discouragement. What he lacked was a tendency towards systematic thinking. His elastic mind worked clearly unorganically and often produced results that lacked compelling logic. He gladly and easily formed certain wishful images from momentary inspirations without rigorously examining their inner justification and durability in mental self-discipline. The balancing self-criticism was missing, which may be particularly painful for people of this kind because it challenges the imagination, which they feel is the best part of their life force and which is sometimes a necessary trait of the commander, and forces it into a serving role. In their midst, such natures feel often alienated, misunderstood, lonely.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>oft fremd, nicht verstanden, einsam.</fragment_2>", "201": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Der deutsche Angriff\".

The counteraction manifests itself in an exaggerated estimation of one's own worth. Therefore, there is rarely room for real advisors who are independent and strong-willed enough to enforce logical thought construction and impartial review.\nFor the self-confidence of the Chief of the General Staff, greatly elevated by the successes of 1915, the language chosen towards the Commander-in-Chief East and Colonel General von Conrad bears eloquent testimony. In the autumn days of this year, his trusted advisor, General von Wild, noted: \"We are at a military peak after Serbia. But it is a difficult, difficult question of how the war should be continued on a large scale. Now the genius spark must ignite. I myself cannot quite bring myself to it yet. Thank God Falkenhayn retains his sovereign calm \u2014 a giant of nerves and performance capability!\" Perhaps the way General von Falkenhayn approached and answered the question of the war decision after his successes last year is best explained by the deep-rooted feeling of his own intellectual superiority over all other involved personalities. In the means he recognized himself, to move from trench warfare to an operation in the open field without the risk of mass breakthrough exceeding his own strength, he may have seen a brilliant solution that could hardly have sprung from the mind of another.\nThis means, or rather the first part of this means, was the attack on Verdun. We see the thought underlying this attack differently today than General von Falkenhayn himself presents it in his work. There can be no doubt that the Chief of the General Staff, in making his decision, was not exclusively or even predominantly guided by the intention to gradually wear down the French army in a spatially limited combat operation of unlimited duration, to bring about the decision of the war on land through a \"bleeding battle on the spot\" without the use of the operational element. The strategic planning of the German Chief of the General Staff was still moving in freer and higher paths at that time. It was not even about the immediate fall of the fortress Verdun, which the command of the 5th Army understandably saw as the assigned task from its point of view. Such a success would certainly have been welcome to him because of the moral impact it would have worldwide. But much more important to him seemed that through the impending doom that gathered over the palladium of France, the French army, if not entirely, was called to the battlefield in strong parts. The German attack had achieved its main purpose if it attracted and weakened the French to such an extent without exposing itself to the danger of a counterattack, that they had to more or less relinquish their operational freedom of action elsewhere.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>hatte seinen Hauptzweck erf\u00fcllt, wenn er, ohne sich selbst der Gefahr eines R\u00fcckschlages auszusetzen, die Franzosen in so starkem Ma\u00dfe anzog und schw\u00e4chte, da\u00df sie ihre operativen Handlungsfreiheit an anderer Stelle mehr oder minder begeben mu\u00dften.</fragment_2>", "202": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Sicherlich h\u00e4tten dann f\u00fcr die Weiterte\".

The attack was not an end in itself; it was intended to loosen the fronts of trench warfare by using the strongest technical means of combat, to initiate the great decisive battle that promised to bring the Western Front into motion.\nA firm idea of how things would play out in the future could, of course, not yet exist. However, General von Falkenhayn considered the various possibilities that could arise as consequences of the attack at Verdun on the overall situation on the Western Front. The most likely and also most welcome to him was that the British army would be forced, willingly or not, to assist its hard-pressed ally at Verdun with a relief offensive on its own front. He confidently expected their victorious defense. Not only that, he hoped to seal the defeat of the English on the mainland with a decisive counterattack. It is striking with what certainty he included in this calculation, which still contained many unknowns, the impact of the unexpectedly occurring defeat at Verdun on the French and English as an undeniable factor. This had the consequence that, despite the clearly recognized limitations of his own forces and means of combat, he believed he could achieve his goal not only at the beginning of the battle but also in its continuation and development with a strong reduction in the use of forces. \"Our problem is,\" he wrote to the Chief of Staff of the 3rd Army, \"to inflict heavy damage on the enemy at a decisive point with relatively modest own expenditure.\"\nEven those who attribute a certain ingenious touch to the strategic basic idea of General von Falkenhayn must admit that it was based on an overestimation of the possibilities of effect and prospects of success, which, according to dynamic law, are inherent in every operation conducted with relatively modest own expenditure. The structure is well and hard established with the first deployment of forces before Verdun. If this had been more strongly measured and consequently the attack base had been expanded from the outset, the attack would probably have achieved the effect expected by the Chief of Staff, although it remains doubtful whether he consequently brought the fortress in its entirety or only the commanding heights of the Maas bank into German possession. Certainly, then for the further development of operations on the Western Front, better prospects would have opened up even in the case that the British relief offensive initially or entirely failed to materialize.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>entwicklung der Operationen an der Westfront bessere Aussichten auch in dem Falle er\u00f6ffnet, da\u00df die britische Entlastungsoffensive zun\u00e4chst oder \u00fcberhaupt ganz ausblieb.</fragment_2>", "203": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"General von Falkenhayn hat niemanden aus seiner n\u00e4chsten Umgebung vollen Einblick in sein Inneres gew\u00e4hrt, auch niemals, soweit bekannt, etwas dar\u00fcber verlauten lassen oder aufgezeichnet, was damals in\"\n<fragment_1>General von Falkenhayn hat niemanden aus seiner n\u00e4chsten Umgebung vollen Einblick in sein Inneres gew\u00e4hrt, auch niemals, soweit bekannt, etwas dar\u00fcber verlauten lassen oder aufgezeichnet, was damals in</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"seiner Seele vorgegangen ist.\"\n<fragment_2>seiner Seele vorgegangen ist.</fragment_2>\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` ends without proper punctuation, suggesting it is incomplete.\n- `fragment_2` begins with \"seiner Seele vorgegangen ist,\" which logically and grammatically continues `fragment_1`.\n- Combining them forms a coherent sentence: \"General von Falkenhayn hat niemanden aus seiner n\u00e4chsten Umgebung vollen Einblick in sein Inneres gew\u00e4hrt, auch niemals, soweit bekannt, etwas dar\u00fcber verlauten lassen oder aufgezeichnet, was damals in seiner Seele vorgegangen ist.\"\n<decision>The fragments align and form a coherent sentence.</decision>\n</thinking>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>673</pageno>\n<header>1916. Considerations on the Operational Plan for the West.</header>\n<body>development of operations on the Western Front opened up better prospects even in the event that the British relief offensive initially or entirely failed to materialize. The German commander retained the invaluable advantage of his own initiative and was able, in the full sense of a victory achieved over the French at their seemingly strongest point in a short time, to spread his wings for a bold flight. He could, while maintaining the threat at Verdun, force a strong incursion, perhaps even a breakthrough, at another point of the enemy front than the one merely recognized. For operational exploitation through a decisive offensive was never achievable \"with relatively modest own expenditure.\" The same applied, perhaps even more so, to an engagement with the British army in the form General von Falkenhayn envisioned under the interaction of defense and counterattack. No matter how favorably one imagines the course of events, a situation that brought such superiority to the German arms that a subsequent operation in the open field could lead to a decision in the war cannot be conceived, considering the \"strength ratios\" on both sides, even if, contrary to all expectations, the opponents refrained from any offensive counterattack on the other theaters of war.\nThe inadequate result of the first assault on Verdun in February is the decisive cause for the unfavorable further development of the situation in the next half year not only in the Meuse area but also on the rest of the Western Front and on all main theaters of the war. All the futile attempts of the following weeks and months to retrospectively increase the result of the first days of attack with constant reinforcement of fresh forces to the desired effect have turned the battle for Verdun very much against the wishes and will of the German Chief of General Staff and also against the original intention of Army High Command 5 more and more and finally entirely into that gruesome \"battle of attrition on the spot,\" which, of course, without regard and distinction of attacker and defender, consumed the forces of both fighting sides equally. However, the loss was more noticeable and consequential on the German side because the French were mostly able to replace their forces before they burned out in battle.\nGeneral von Falkenhayn granted no one from his immediate surroundings full insight into his inner thoughts, nor, as far as is known, did he ever let anything be known or recorded about what was then going on in his soul.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>seiner Seele vorgegangen ist.</fragment_2>", "204": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Gewi\u00df lag die Schuld des Bundesgenossen\".

Outwardly, he has always maintained a calm demeanor, with few exceptions that can be explained by momentary moods, in high self-control. Therefore, military historiography can only make the ascertainable actions and omissions of the Chief of General Staff the basis of a psychological portrait that shows itself in the most severe crisis of his work. It must emphasize, where it cannot prove, being aware that perhaps all the strokes of the picture are correctly drawn. With this reservation, it must be said: General von Falkenhayn, under the heavy pressure of the unexpected events of Verdun, which overturned all his assumptions, all his wishes and hopes, was unable to maintain the mental balance that the commander needs, \"to allow the finest play despite the storms in one's own breast of insight and conviction like the needle of the compass on a storm-tossed ship\"). More than once he tried to free himself from the shackles into which the nerve-shattering experience of the energy-consuming battle in the Maas area had entangled his soul. But again and again, he returned to the self-tormenting question of what should become of this battle, to the attempt to continue the enterprise once begun, even if it had long since lost its original meaning, with new deployment of men and material to a tolerable end. Thus, General von Falkenhayn became the thrall of his own work, which had shot up far beyond the intended scope with elemental force and now demanded its tribute imperiously. And this subjugation of mind and spirit to matter persisted, even as he saw with growing clarity a new severe storm gathering threateningly at another point on the Western Front. He did consider whether and how he could prevent this danger, nip it in the bud, but he did not make the ruthless decision to secure the upper hand through quick and decisive action. He waited.\nThen unexpectedly, the lightning struck at a distant third point. What had been considered almost impossible in the conceptual world of General von Falkenhayn occurred with the suddenness and self-evidence of a devastating natural event. The Russian army provided such overwhelming proof of the still-living offensive power within it that suddenly and unexpectedly the severe dangers of the multi-front war, long considered overcome, reappeared in their old size and sharpness. Certainly, the blame lay clearly with the ally, who had failed in fulfilling a simple duty task.</body>\n<footer>1) from Clausewitz, On War.

Essentially, Luck also avenged himself on the German Chief of General Staff for the great omission of the previous year. Once again, the Western Army, as so often before, despite the tense situation in which it found itself, had to give up considerable forces to avert the worst disaster in the East. Only after weeks of varied and crisis-filled battles, which were not only associated with significant territorial loss but also severely shook the internal structure of the allied military, was it possible to bring the situation somewhat back into balance. General von Falkenhayn deserves credit for keeping the German reinforcement within the limits that were an unavoidable necessity given the situation on the other theaters of war, especially in the West.\nFor there, too, the storm at the Somme had meanwhile come to a bloody discharge. It became all the more consequential as the German dike, insufficiently equipped with defensive means, broke at various points. Its complete collapse could be prevented by the rapid deployment of hastily assembled troop units from all sides, but the situation remained tense until breaking point and led to disproportionately high and rapid consumption of forces in rigid defense. The idea of a counterattack, with which General von Falkenhayn had hoped to end the great decisive battle on the Western Front victoriously by the turn of the year, was gone. The opponents bled the law.\nIn addition to the British army, considerable parts of the French participated in the combat operations in the Somme area. At Verdun, too, the French repeatedly delivered astonishing demonstrations not only of their resistance capabilities but also of their still inherent offensive power. However, after the failure of the last desperate effort to gain the high ground around Souville, the German leadership was forced to resort to \"strict defense\" to free up forces and resources to support the Somme front. Thus, given the still sharply tense situation, the combat situation in the Meuse area was only to a limited extent. Thus, the warfare of the Quadruple Alliance lived everywhere from hand to mouth in the true sense of the word since early June. Nothing characterizes this fact better than the statement made by General von Falkenhayn himself in a letter to the Chancellor on August 21: \"Under the immense pressure that rests on us, we have no surplus of forces. Any shift in one direction inevitably leads to dangerous weaknesses elsewhere, which can mean our annihilation.\"</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "206": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Auch wenn es General von Falkenhayn dabei letzten Endes versagt geblieben ist, die Aufgabe, vor die er gestellt war, siegreich zu meistern, so wird er doch als F\u00fchrer des deutschen Heeres in Ehren genannt werden.\" This appears to be a complete sentence as it ends with a period and expresses a complete thought.\n\n<fragment_1>Auch wenn es General von Falkenhayn dabei letzten Endes versagt geblieben ist, die Aufgabe, vor die er gestellt war, siegreich zu meistern, so wird er doch als F\u00fchrer des deutschen Heeres in Ehren genannt werden.</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThere is no text provided for `<german_page_2>`, indicating that there is no continuation or additional fragment to consider.\n\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` is a complete sentence with a coherent grammatical structure and a complete thought.\n- `fragment_2` is empty, indicating there is no continuation from `<german_page_2>`.\n- Since `fragment_1` is complete and `fragment_2` is empty, there is no fragmentation issue to resolve.\n\n<decision>The fragments do not align and do not form a single coherent sentence. `fragment_1` is complete, and `fragment_2` is empty.</decision>\n</thinking>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>676</pageno>\n<header>Review of the Warfare of General von Falkenhayn.</header>\n<body>even if only the slightest mistake in weighing the measures expected from the enemy were made.\" This was the open admission that all decision-making and freedom of action had been lost. Only with difficulty did the fortress of the alliance hold. Then Romania joined the ranks of the allied powers as a new enemy.\nWith this extreme exacerbation of the situation, the two-year warfare of General von Falkenhayn came to an end.\nIn view of the outcome, it must not be forgotten how difficult the task was that he faced from the beginning of his activities. Measured by the effort, leadership skills, and successes of the opponents, his performance stands at a considerable height, although he had at his disposal in the German army a military tool to which none of the opponents had anything equivalent to oppose. The belief in the capabilities of this army is what repeatedly challenges one to examine whether more could not have been achieved with such a weapon after a lost war. However, even in retrospective consideration, it is not easy to identify a path that promised the decisive success required in Germany's situation without the greatest daring. That General von Falkenhayn, despite the overwhelming and constantly growing superiority of the enemies, succeeded in pushing the Russian masses far back from Germany's borders, clearing the way to Turkey by defeating Serbia, and at the same time maintaining the extended front against all enemy assaults on the western theater of war for two years, are deeds that belong to history. Even if General von Falkenhayn ultimately failed to master the task he was set, he will still be honored as a leader of the German army.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "207": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nSince the content of `<german_page_1>` is not provided, I cannot extract `fragment_1`.
