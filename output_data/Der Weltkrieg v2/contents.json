Their most essential part is the battles of the 8th Army in East Prussia. This victorious struggle of a German minority against multiple Russian superior forces may well claim special interest from all sides. At its center is the victory at Tannenberg, which military history has nothing comparable to set beside. At the same time, these battles are almost the only ones that took place on German soil and thus affected German land and German compatriots more than all other theaters of war. For this reason, they deserve a broader space in a German work on the World War than other battles. It seemed justified to go into the details of the combat action here more closely than is possible in the other volumes of the complete work. The feelings of the German reader should be taken into account when the immediately visible result of the battles, \"The Liberation of East Prussia,\" was chosen as the title.\nThe contribution of the allied Austro-Hungarian army could only be presented insofar as it seemed necessary for understanding the larger contexts, beyond that only in cases where imperial German troops (Landwehr corps) were involved in the battles.\nThe operations of the Russians could be described almost seamlessly based on the available material. The writings published by the Russian \"Commission for the Study and Evaluation of the Experiences of the World War and the Civil War,\" which represent an official Russian work on the operations, became accessible to the Reichsarchiv before the completion of the work.

Thus, he could only leave the bare minimum of troops against the East. This weak troop deployment, together with the Austro-Hungarian army, was to conduct a holding action until strong German forces arrived from the West to bring the decision in the East as well.\nFrom the Romanian northern border to the Baltic Sea at Memel, a 900 km long front measured in a straight line had to be protected against Russian superiority (for comparison, it should be noted that in the West the distance from the Swiss to the Luxembourg border is only 220, to Calais 500 km). Following the course of the border itself, the line to be covered in the East measured almost 1600 km. The defense on this stretch in Austria-Hungary could largely lean on the course of the Dniester and San and then again on the Carpathians, but thereby gave up the wide and fertile Galician foreland. In Germany, initially only the lake district of East Prussia, then further back the German part of the Vistula course offered natural protection. From the Galician northern border to Thorn, however, there remained a gap about 300 km wide, half as large again as in the West between Switzerland and Luxembourg. It fell into the territory of the enemy, who securely held the Vistula crossings with the fortified places of Ivangorod, Warsaw, and Nowogeorgiewsk. No mountain or river obstacle could stop the advance of the Russian masses here; in the wide spaces of the Polish plains, they were able to outmarch the numerically weaker defender from any position; just as the Niemen-San front, the German Vistula front could already be outflanked on Russian soil.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>des polnischen Flachlandes vermochten sie den an Zahl schw\u00e4cheren Ver- teidiger aus jeder Stellung herauszumarschieren; ebenso wie die Njemen- San-Front konnte die deutsche Weichsel-Front schon auf russischem Boden umgangen werden.</fragment_2>", "011": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Daher regte die Wiener Regierung in Berlin einen Gedankenaustausch der beiderseitigen Generalstabschefs an.\"\nThis appears to be a complete sentence, ending with a period.

Thus, a pure defense in the East was not feasible. Only if it was possible to deliver effective blows to the Russian army before it was fully assembled and had grown into an overwhelming superiority, was there a prospect of carrying out the defense for a longer period. Otherwise, everything depended on a rapid and decisive victory over France. Once that was achieved, Count Schlieffen also wanted to go on the offensive in the East with full force.\nFor the weak German Eastern forces, an initial deployment in East Prussia was given to protect this most endangered German territory by the course of the border. Separated far from these forces by Russian territory, the Austro-Hungarian army could march in Galicia. However, Count Schlieffen believed that he could hardly count on an offensive of this army against Russia before the arrival of strong German forces from the West. Such an early Austro-Hungarian offensive was also not urgent, as the deployment of the Russian army could only proceed slowly. From it, an impact on the decisive battle against France was not to be feared at first. Thus, Count Schlieffen did not insist on reaching a firm conclusion with the Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff on the initial operations against Russia: The German victory over France was the prerequisite for the successful conduct of the campaign against Russia and thus also for the ultimate success of Austria-Hungary. The question of the cooperation of both armies against Russia only gained importance when strong German forces were free from the West. How the situation in the East would develop until then could not be foreseen beforehand.\nEven in the first years of General v. Moltke's tenure, who was appointed successor to Count Schlieffen in 1906, these conditions did not change. Russia was temporarily weakened by the war against Japan and internal unrest, but it quickly recovered.\nIn the winter of 1908/09, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy faced a serious immediate war threat from the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

General von Conrad pointed out that Austria-Hungary would find itself in a difficult position in a war against Russia with Serbia and Montenegro at its back. He assumed at the time that \"in all likelihood Russia (and France) would initially appear to wait peacefully and only then engage in hostile actions when the Monarchy was already forced into military intervention against Serbia and Montenegro and was engaged there with strong forces. \u2014 This brings the centrality to the forefront, first to deliver a rapid and decisive blow against Serbia, and then to draw the forces freed up against Russia.\" However, in such a case, one could hardly expect to be at the Russian border earlier than three months after mobilization. \u2014 As a result of his statements, General von Conrad concluded that only in the admittedly unlikely case of an \"immediate main strike against Russia with very secondary treatment of the Balkan opponents\" by the 22nd \"mobilization day\" could about 40 Austro-Hungarian divisions be assembled in Eastern Galicia to seize the offensive. In the much more likely case of a prior battle against Serbia, however, only about 30 infantry divisions would be ready against Russia at the same time, with 8\u20149 more only about two months later. In this case, it is \"particularly dependent on the behavior planned by Germany, where the assembly of the 30 divisions is to take place and when the offensive is to begin.\"\nGeneral von Moltke stated in his response (dated January 21, 1909) that with the possible military intervention of Russia against Austria-Hungary, the \"casus foederis\" for Germany was given. \"At the time when Russia mobilizes, Germany will also mobilize, namely its entire army. From this moment on, however, Germany must also reckon with a war against France, perhaps also against England. These circumstances are well known to the entire European diplomacy, and therein perhaps lies the assurance that none of the great powers will ignite the burden of war due to Serbian ambitions, which can set the roof of all Europe on fire. Therefore, it seems to me quite unlikely that Russia, for such considerations, will refrain from a military conflict with the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy with Serbia.\"\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>mit Serbien sich ruhig verhalten wird, scheint mir durchaus nicht unwahrscheinlich.</fragment_2>", "013": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Um mit diesen Kr\u00e4ften zu\".

Moltke, like Count Schlieffen, considered a\nquick decision possible. He stated that through such a\ndecision, effective assistance would ultimately be provided to the Danube Monarchy. In the east, Austria-Hungary would \"itself\"\nbe able to initially engage in the fight with only 30 divisions with a prospect of success,\nespecially if Romania joins its side. The\nsignificant difficulties of Russian mobilization, the anticipated\nslowness of Russian operations, the great difficulty\nof making changes to the planned deployment, which would initially also\nhave to be carried out against Germany, make it seem likely\nthat a decisive decision on the western border will have already been made before the events on\nthe Austro-Hungarian border have matured into such.\"\nGeneral v. Conrad agreed with Moltke's view that Germany must deliver the main blow in a\ntwo-front war first against France. He himself had reached the same solution in an\nearlier study. In addition, he concluded in his letter: If Austria-Hungary were to\nmarch against Russia from the outset, then, with the simultaneous\nbinding of parts of the Russian army through assumptions, about on\nthe 29th \"mobilization day,\" 40 Austro-Hungarian divisions would meet 32\u00bd to\n34\u00bd Russian divisions. Thus, in this, albeit unlikely case, an Austro-Hungarian offensive would be promising,\nif only the 19\u00bd divisions expected against East Prussia and the 3 in Warsaw\nwere \"tied up\" by German forces. However, if\nAustria-Hungary, as is most likely, had previously deployed significant\nforces in the Balkans, then against Russia\ninitially only 30, perhaps even only 28 (or even 27) Austro-Hungarian\ndivisions would be available. The prospects for engaging in combat\nthen did not appear as favorable to General v. Conrad as\nGeneral v. Moltke had feared. Therefore, he thought it might be more advantageous in such a\ncase to first wait for the arrival of German reinforcements\nfrom the west. The Russians could reach the lower Vistula, perhaps even the area between Thorn and Posen\non the 35th mobilization day, while by waiting \"already on the 35th mobilization\nday strong German forces (at least 20 divisions, leaving then still\n51 against France)\" would appear in the east. To engage with these forces, it could then \"purely spatially theoretically be a question of even considering the Austro-Hungarian deployment under occupation of the Carpathian passes up to the line Bartfeld\u2014Neu-Sandez\u2014Bochnia (35 km east of Krakow) \u2014 that is, far into West Galicia \u2014 to be relocated.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>zusammenzuwirken, k\u00f6nne dann \u201erein r\u00e4umlich theoretisch genommen\u201c sogar zur Frage stehen, den \u00f6sterreichisch-ungarischen Aufmarsch unter Besetzung der Karpatenp\u00e4sse bis in die Linie Bartfeld\u2014Neu-Sandez\u2014Bochnia (35 km \u00f6stlich Krakau) \u2014 das hie\u00df also weit nach Westgalizien \u2014 zur\u00fcckzulegen.</fragment_2>", "014": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"So hatte General v.

General v. Conrad ties \nthe question of the strength and behavior of the German forces remaining in the east \nin a two-front war, and whether they would be able to \"bind 19\u00bd Russian divisions.\" \nFurthermore, he asked about the strength, arrival time, and use of the reinforcements \nexpected later from the western theater of war. \nGeneral v.

He believed \nabsolutely that these German forces were strong enough to tie down even 19\u00bd \nRussian divisions, \"because the Russians will certainly strive \nto achieve success over the German minority and to penetrate \nGerman territory. To do this, they must not further weaken themselves.

In this sense, the German Chief of Staff wrote at the end of his letter: \"If war should come, I am of the opinion that the great goals must precede the small ones, so the overthrow of France and Russia must be at the forefront of all measures. If this great goal is achieved, then the Serbian issue for Austria will resolve itself.\"\nWithout going into these thoughts further, General v. Conrad now came forward on March 8 with a new request.

He seemed to view the situation more favorably in this case as well, for he wrote: \"With my firm aversion to any waiting and my conviction of the value of initiative, I also consider the forward deployment and the earliest possible offensive in this case.\" He further explained that under favorable circumstances, he could begin the offensive against the Russian 3rd Army with considerable superiority, which was then expected as the western wing of the Russian deployment between the Bug and Vistula. However, this offensive also required a simultaneous German attack with about 10 divisions from East Prussia against the Russian 2nd Army, thus against the Narew, \"so that it would not be possible for the Russian 1st and 2nd Army to turn additional forces against the Austro-Hungarian Army. \u2014 If the 10 German divisions succeeded in defeating the Russian Narew Army\" (then assumed to be 9\u00bd divisions) \"and if the 17-18 Austro-Hungarian divisions succeeded similarly against the Russian 3rd Army (9\u00bd divisions), this would be a successful initiation of the campaign, in which the forces of the allies that could be spared from France and those to be drawn from the Balkans could then intervene.\"</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>wohl eine erfolgreiche Einleitung des Feldzuges, in welchem dann die gegen Frankreich entbehrlichen und die vom Balkan heranzuziehenden Kr\u00e4fte der Verb\u00fcndeten einzugreifen verm\u00f6chten.</fragment_2>", "016": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"der auf ein tatkr\u00e4ftiges Handeln \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns gegen Ru\u00dfland eben doch nur bei starker deutscher\".

Moltke found himself in a difficult position regarding the demand for this German offensive from East Prussia, but in his response of March 19, he declared himself ready to comply with the new wishes of General v. Conrad. The reasons for this decision cannot be determined, as records are missing and the Chief of the General Staff, as far as can be ascertained, was only verbally informed about this issue. Thus, one must rely on assumptions: General v. Moltke had previously explained to General v. Conrad that the Russians would certainly not withdraw any forces initially deployed against East Prussia. The view expressed by General v. Conrad in his penultimate letter, that the Russians could already be standing at the German Vistula and between Thorn and Posen by the 35th day of mobilization, was undoubtedly based on the same perception. However, the idea expressed in the current letter from General v. Conrad and the associated demand for a German offensive against the Narew on the 20th or 24th day of mobilization was not easy to reconcile. General v. Moltke continued to expect an early Russian attack against East Prussia and stated in his response: \u201cFrance may benefit if the Russian forces intended to march into Germany are used against Austria-Hungary, because only an unstoppable advance in Prussia could draw German forces away from the French.\u201d In such an attack by the Russians against East Prussia, however, it was impossible to overlook, given their superiority and their deployment aimed at encirclement, how the situation would develop by the 20th or 24th Austrian-Hungarian \u201cmobilization day.\u201d To promise an attack from East Prussia in a previously determined direction at this time did not correspond to the views that General v. Moltke had about the nature of military leadership. But it may have seemed expedient to him to present this differing fundamental view to the Chief of the General Staff of the allied army. Furthermore, it is probably not wrong to assume that General v. Moltke, given the conditions now set by General v. Conrad, had to recall the view of Count Schlieffen, who only considered decisive action by Austria-Hungary against Russia feasible with strong German support.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Unterst\u00fctzung rechnete.</fragment_2>", "017": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"So schrieb General v.

However, given the circumstances, a decision against France was impossible. After all, the Bosnian crisis had just reached its peak. In such a situation, one could not question the results of all previous negotiations but had to try to help as best as possible. Thus, General v. Moltke \u2014 albeit with a heavy heart \u2014 decided to make the commitment.\nHe wrote about it: An attack by weak German forces against the fortified Narew line would indeed face great difficulties and was also \"threatened on the right flank by Warsaw, on the left by counterattacks from Lomsha. \u2014 Nevertheless, I will not hesitate to make the attack to support the simultaneous Austrian offensive. Your Excellencies can rely on this promise, which is well considered. The condition is that the movements of the allies are initiated simultaneously and carried out unconditionally. \u2014 Should the execution of the intentions be made impossible for one of the allies by the enemy, the fastest mutual notification is absolutely necessary, as the security of the individual depends entirely on the cooperation of both.\"\nShortly after the dispatch of this letter, the political situation suddenly changed at the end of March 1909: Serbia yielded, the danger of an imminent war, which had characterized the negotiations of the two chiefs of staff, was over. However, the agreements reached were still regarded by both sides as a basis for a possible jointly conducted war, although the conditions under which it was to be conducted changed in many respects in the following years. Thus, General v. Conrad wrote to General v. Moltke on April 10, that now, if war were to come, the \"case would come to the fore that the monarchy would leave only the necessary forces against Serbia and Montenegro, but would assemble the main force against Russia. The latter was in line with the intention of a genuine offensive... This corresponded to the view always held by General v. Moltke.\nThe Balkan War of the winter of 1912/13 and its consequences, however, again highlighted the possibility that war might first come against Serbia, as Russia immediately intervened. The timely deployment of sufficient Austro-Hungarian forces against Russia was thus again called into question. Thus wrote General v. Conrad, who, after a one-year interruption, had just been reappointed to the head of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff, in January 1913 to General v. Moltke, he had always regarded the German troops intended for East Prussia as the minimum of that force which seems necessary to somewhat relieve the Austro-Hungarian main forces from Russian advances from the Vistula region and to prevent the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area north of Polesie to those south of it, thus against the Austro-Hungarian forces.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>der nach einj\u00e4hriger Unterbrechung soeben wieder an die Spitze des \u00f6sterreichisch-ungarischen Generalstabes berufen worden war, im Januar 1913 an General v.

Then he elaborated on the overall situation: \"Should ... initially come to an action of the monarchy against Serbia, the behavior of the monarchy would be determined by the moment in which Russia undertakes the first hostile act (thus already the mobilization). \u2014 If possible in time, all forces intended against Russia would still be directed against Russia, so that 40 divisions would be available there; however, if no longer possible in time, an attempt would be made to first deliver a decisive blow against Serbia, and then only to direct the forces freed up against Russia.\" The \"involvement of this case\" was completely clear to General v.

Moltke sought to accommodate the wishes of \nGeneral v. Conrad as much as possible by expressing the hope that it might \nvery soon be possible, after the opening of hostilities in the West, to deploy \nadditional second-line forces against Russia. For the requested advance \nfrom Silesia, however, he only offered Landwehr and reserve units in the \nstrength of a corps (Landwehr corps) due to the unfavorable overall \nGerman force situation, which had previously been intended for the \nprotection of the Upper Silesian industrial area, but were not very suitable \nfor use in the open field.

Austria-Hungary wanted, as soon \nas Russia mobilized, to deploy the bulk of its army against this country \nand to march closely along the border in Eastern Galicia to advance into \nPoland. Germany wanted to support this offensive: directly through the \nadvance of a corps from Silesia, indirectly by deploying 15 divisions in \nEast Prussia and binding the arriving Russian forces on this front with an \nattack against the Narew. These agreements were calculated for the first \nweeks of the war, during which close cooperation between the two allies \u2014 \napart from the advance from Silesia \u2014 was not yet in question. The main \nthing remained to be emphasized, that if necessary, victories over France, \nstrong German forces could be deployed in the East, which could hardly \nbe foreseen in advance.

The extremely delicate\nand hardly satisfactorily solvable question of the supreme command in the East\nwas therefore not addressed in the peace negotiations between the two chiefs of staff.\nAs far as the position of the allied powers towards each other\nseemed possible, the cooperation of the German and Austro-Hungarian\nforces for the case of war was regulated. That nevertheless\ndifferences of opinion remained in the basic views\nis not surprising given the nature of the alliance relationship:\nThus, General v. Conrad never completely abandoned the idea\nof possibly waging a war in the Balkans, regardless\nof the considerable weakening of the forces available against Russia\nand the resulting additional burden on Germany.\nGeneral v. Moltke, on the other hand, always considered the role of Austria-Hungary for\nthe beginning of the war only from the perspective that\nthe decision sought against France \u2014 on which ultimately\neverything depended \u2014 should not be questioned by Russia's advance.\nThis danger grew with the increasing\nstrengthening of Russia and the year-by-year increasing\nacceleration of its deployment. Moreover, the military situation\nof Austria-Hungary had become more difficult due to Serbia's uncertain stance since 1913.\nIt became all the more important that in the event\nof a war it was not distracted by its Balkan opponents, but\nconcentrated all its strength against Russia. Although\nno decision was initially sought against\nthis country, the fight against Russia had to be conducted offensively. If General\nv. Conrad delayed his deployment, as he had repeatedly indicated, or\nlimited himself to defense, then the Russians gained full freedom of action according to\nGeneral v. Moltke's view and had the\nchoice to attack Austria-Hungary or Germany with united force.\nBut on the German front, the forces here were smaller,\nand ultimately it would also be clear to the Russians that not the direction towards\nVienna, but towards Berlin was decisive for the overall situation.\nIf the Russian masses advanced towards Berlin without much\ndelay, it would \"spur France's resistance to the utmost, even after\nsevere defeats, and eventually force German\nforces to retreat from the west to protect the capital.\"1).

This had not escaped the notice of the German and Austro-Hungarian General Staff.\nIt was known about the Russian army that it had fully recovered from the defeat in East Asia and its consequences. Supported by French money, encouraged and supervised by frequent visits from representatives of the allied army and, with favorable state finances, not least promoted by the ever-approving parliament, the Russian army had been extraordinarily strengthened in power and readiness. Due to the strict secrecy customary in Russia for military measures, the vast expanse of the territory, the sharp political surveillance of foreign traffic, and the extremely strict espionage laws, it was very difficult for the German General Staff to continuously form an accurate picture of this development, which was by no means complete at the outbreak of war.\nThe peace strength was estimated by the German General Staff for 1914 at 1,445,000 men, for the winter even a good third higher. The service time under the flag was longer than with the Central Powers and amounted to 3\u00bd, sometimes even 4\u00bc years. This compensated for the sluggishness of the replacement, of which in 1909 still 38% could neither read nor write, to a significant extent. The long active service time was followed by extensive exercises in the reserve and in the \"Reichswehr\" (Landwehr), to which, increasing annually, almost 900,000 men were to be called up for 6 weeks in 1914.\nThe mobilization seemed to be well prepared, the time required for the deployments was further shortened by large strategic railway constructions. Thus, the German General Staff emphasized in a memorandum from spring 1914 that \"the war readiness of Russia in some points surpasses the war readiness of the other great powers, including Germany, namely: by eliminating the military weakness period in winter due to the retention of the oldest age group until the recruits are fully trained, \u2014 by frequent practical testing of all mobilization measures with the help of trial and test mobilizations, \u2014 by the possibility of extraordinary acceleration of mobilization with the help of the war preparation period\".\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>in einigen Punktten \u00fcber die Kriegsbereitschaft der \u00fcbrigen Gro\u00dfm\u00e4chte einschlie\u00dflich Deutschlands erhebt, n\u00e4mlich: durch das Ausscheiden der milit\u00e4rischen Schw\u00e4cheperiode im Winter infolge Zur\u00fcckbehaltung des \u00e4ltesten Jahrgangs bis zur vollendeten Ausbildung der Rekruten, \u2014 durch h\u00e4ufige praktische Erprobung der gesamten Mobilmachungsma\u00dfnahmen mit Hilfe der Versuchs- und Probemobilmachungen, \u2014 durch die M\u00f6glichkeit au\u00dferordentlicher Beschleunigung der Mobilmachung mit Hilfe der Kriegsvorbereitungsperiode</fragment_2>", "023": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Der Bestand an ausgebildeten Mannschaften war damit aber bei weitem noch nicht ersch\u00f6pft.\"\n<fragment_1>Der Bestand an ausgebildeten Mannschaften war damit aber bei weitem noch nicht ersch\u00f6pft.</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"In bezug auf Ausbildung, Bewaffnung und Ausr\u00fcstung wurde das russische Heer als vollwertig angesehen, obgleich seine aktiven Verb\u00e4nde in der St\u00e4rke der Gesch\u00fctzausr\u00fcstung hinter gleichartigen deutschen Verb\u00e4nden zur\u00fcckstanden; daf\u00fcr waren sie den \u00f6sterreichisch-ungarischen in dieser Hinsicht um so mehr \u00fcberlegen.\"\n<fragment_2>In bezug auf Ausbildung, Bewaffnung und Ausr\u00fcstung wurde das russische Heer als vollwertig angesehen, obgleich seine aktiven Verb\u00e4nde in der St\u00e4rke der Gesch\u00fctzausr\u00fcstung hinter gleichartigen deutschen Verb\u00e4nden zur\u00fcckstanden; daf\u00fcr waren sie den \u00f6sterreichisch-ungarischen in dieser Hinsicht um so mehr \u00fcberlegen.</fragment_2>\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` is a complete sentence, ending with a period, indicating it is coherent and complete.\n- `fragment_2` starts a new topic regarding the Russian army's training, armament, and equipment, which does not logically or grammatically continue `fragment_1`.\n- The fragments are independent and do not logically or grammatically connect into a single sentence.\n<decision>The fragments do not align and do not form a single coherent sentence.</decision>\n</thinking>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>16</pageno>\n<header>The Armaments and Force Ratios until Summer 1914.</header>\n<body>raises several points about the war readiness of the other great powers including Germany, namely: through the elimination of the military weakness period in winter due to retention of the oldest year group until the completed training of recruits, \u2014 through frequent practical testing of all mobilization measures with the help of trial and test mobilizations, \u2014 through the possibility of extraordinary acceleration of mobilization with the help of the \"war preparation period\". Based on intelligence about measures during the Balkan Wars of 1912/13, the memorandum further explained that this \"war preparation period\" allowed, in times of political tension, \"to assign supplementary personnel and horses to the troops before the start of actual mobilization\" and to prepare these units to such an extent that they could ultimately be ready to march on the 1st or 2nd day of mobilization. The possibility had to be considered that the Russians might try to compensate for the Central Powers' head start in deployment in this way and thereby call into question an initial success for them.\nIn 1914, the German General Staff expected that Russia \u2014 without the 7\u00bd Siberian and Turkestan corps, which might be tied down in the East but would in any case arrive late on the European theater of war \u2014 would initially deploy its army in the following strength\u00b9):\nField forces: 30 Corps with 59 active Infantry Divisions and\n                           12 active Rifle Brigades,\n           further 35 Reserve Divisions,\n           total of 100 Infantry Divisions\u00b2) and\n                  35\u00bd Cavalry and Cossack\n                       Divisions\nwith a total strength of . . . . . . . . . . . 2,712,000 men,\nfurther 40 Territorial (Landwehr) Divisions as well as\ngarrison troops and replacement troops of the active\narmy with a total strength of . . . . . . . 929,000 \"\nAll in all (without Siberian and Turkestan\ntroops) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,641,000 men.\nThe stock of trained personnel was, however, far from exhausted with this.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) The actual strength is given on p. 25ff. and in the war organization, Appendix 1. \u2014 Further details see Vol. I, p. 33-40.\n\u00b2) In this calculation, 12 Rifle Brigades = 6 Divisions.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "024": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Mit Rum\u00e4nien als Bundesgenossen rechneten General v.

Even if revolutionary tendencies occasionally appeared, the Russian soldier was still considered loyal to his Tsar, willing, and reliable. He was taught that all his efforts were to serve one purpose. The most widespread Russian military journal, \"Raswjedtschik,\" wrote about this at New Year 1914: \"We are all well aware that we are preparing for a war on the Western Front, primarily against the Germans (Austria-Hungary and Germany). Therefore, we must base all our troop exercises on the assumption that we are waging war against the Germans; for example, one of the maneuvering parties must always be called the 'German.' Not only the troops, but the entire Russian people must become accustomed to the idea that we are preparing for a war of annihilation against the Germans and that the German states must be defeated, even if we lose hundreds of thousands of people in the process.\"\nThe Central Powers still expected the Russian advance primarily against Austria-Hungary. The German General Staff considered the likelihood of an early attack on East Prussia. Otherwise, it was considered possible, but not certain, that the Russians would wait until the completion of their deployment and only then, when fully assembled, proceed to a general attack. The area west of the Vistula, as was increasingly clear, would initially be abandoned. The fortifications of Warsaw and Iwangorod had been allowed to become obsolete and were ultimately intended for abandonment.\nIn the spring of 1914, the German General Staff calculated that Russia, fully utilizing the \"war preparation period,\" had the possibility of deploying 63 infantry and reserve divisions and 22 cavalry divisions on its European border by the 18th day of mobilization.\nGeneral v. Moltke and General v. Conrad no longer counted on Romania as an ally since the spring of 1914. As a result, 8-10 divisions were lost for the Central Powers, but just as many enemy divisions were freed up.</body>\n<footer>1) Further details are provided in the comparative overview in Appendix 2.\n2) The memorandum states: \"31\u00bd corps, including 13 reserve divisions.\"</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>f\u00fcr die Mittelm\u00e4chte 8\u201410 Divisionen weggefallen, ebenso viele feindliche aber frei geworden.</fragment_2>", "025": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Von ihnen stand ein gro\u00dfer Teil in den neuerworbenen Gebieten und konnte von dort, angesichts der ung\u00fcnstigen Verkehrsverh\u00e4ltnisse des Landes,\".

Austria-Hungary had lost its secure flank support for its advance against Russia and even saw itself compelled to prepare for the deployment of border guard troops against its ally in all cases.\nSerbia emerged victorious from two wars in 1913. The enlargement of its territory by about two-thirds of its previous size and the population growth from three to over four million people meant a significant strengthening of power. This could only be temporarily diminished by the incorporation of resistant foreign ethnic groups associated with land acquisition, but not permanently questioned. The increase in the peacetime strength of the army from 30,000 men to about double was immediately undertaken.\nShortly before the World War, the German and Austro-Hungarian general staffs estimated the wartime strength of the Serbian army at 12 divisions with 285,000 men as an operational army and 115,000 men in reserve and occupation troops and militia, totaling 400,000 men.\nFor the defense of its own, often impassable mountainous terrain, this army was always regarded as a very noteworthy opponent. Now, victorious campaigns had raised the Serbs' confidence in their own abilities. They grew next to Romania to become the foremost military power in the Balkans. Their army could also gain significance in the attack, although it still seemed incomparable to the Russian one. Above all, it lacked the ability to adequately supplement armament and equipment through domestic production.\nThe much smaller Montenegrin army was a people's levy without long training periods. It was considered capable only for the defense of its mountains.\nThus, on the Balkan front, only an attack by at most 12 Serbian divisions was to be expected. A large part of them was stationed in the newly acquired territories and could from there, given the unfavorable traffic conditions of the country, even if immediately set in motion, probably only arrive at the border against the Danube Monarchy after several weeks.</body>\n<footer>1) Conrad IV, p. 301.

The purely German and subsequently the purely Hungarian units were the best of the army and wholeheartedly committed to the cause. But there were not too many of them. 58% of the army belonged to other nationalities, whose concerns differed more or less from those of the entire state. Among them were 17% Czechs and Slovaks, as many as the Hungarians, then Poles, Ruthenians, Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Romanians and Italians. Within the peacetime army, however, the national contrasts of the various ethnic groups played hardly any role. How the situation would develop, given the increasing sharpness of these contrasts and the often excessive agitation, in the event of mobilization, could not be predicted with certainty.\nThe extremely numerous, but very weak peacetime contingents were a peculiarity of the army. During mobilization, they consumed almost the entire stock of trained personnel. Therefore, the formation of reserve formations had to be abandoned.

Superiority over the \nanticipated opponents can only be hoped for from the excellent \nofficer corps, the growing leadership training, the more active \noffensive spirit and the previously apparently good discipline.\" The \nmemorandum concluded with the statement that Austria-Hungary, if \nit had to fight against Russia and in the Balkans simultaneously, \ncould not provide the urgently needed relief to the German forces in \nEast Prussia.\nBut Germany had also not strengthened its army by 1914 to the extent \nthat it could make additional forces available for the eastern theater \ngiven the increasing needs of the western theater. Thus, it was \nimpossible for General v. Moltke, until the outbreak of war, to comply \nwith the repeated requests of General v. Conrad for the provision of \nstronger forces in East Prussia. In 1914, no more could be provided \nthere in the event of war than in 1909. On the contrary, since the spring \nof 1913, instead of two reserve corps, individual replacement divisions \nhad to be deployed there, which, although roughly equivalent to the \nreserve divisions in composition and equipment, could only be ready \nto march on the 11th day of mobilization.

Meanwhile, Austria had to fend off about 12 Serbian divisions. With such an imbalance in numbers, it was doubly necessary to concentrate the available forces in the decisive direction: The Serbian army, limited in artillery and technical resources, could relatively easily prevent an incursion into Hungary at the Danube and Save, and an enemy offensive through the rugged mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina would soon stall due to supply difficulties. Thus, it seemed very possible at the Ballan border to conduct a sustainable defense with inferior forces. The 8-9 divisions that General v. Conrad had reportedly planned for this purpose were already considered a very ample deployment by the German General Staff. The fewer forces Austria-Hungary stationed at its southern border, the stronger it could appear on the decisive battlefield. The 40 divisions planned for this since 1909 were always considered the minimum by the German General Staff that could and had to be made available against Russia. Since the further growth and increased attack readiness of the Russian forces, and especially since the loss of Romania, they were hardly sufficient. But even the latest Austro-Hungarian reinforcements brought no significant improvement in the number of forces available against Russia. At the Galician front, General v. Conrad had been able to count on 48 divisions, including the Romanians, against 40 Russian ones for the 29th \"Mobilization Day\" in 1909; in 1914, the ratio now had to be \u2014 without the Romanians \u2014 according to the pre-war calculations of the Vienna General Staff on the 30th Mobilization Day, 40 Austro-Hungarian against 60 Russian divisions!\nHowever, this numerical imbalance was not expected from the start.

Moltke had in 1909 envisaged German reinforcements for the East \u2014 albeit with all reservations \u2014 in the most favorable case already by the 30th day of mobilization, later he is said to have occasionally spoken of the 40th day of mobilization. At the already mentioned meeting with General v. Conrad on May 12, 1914, in Karlsbad, the last before the war, the Generaloberst mentioned significantly later times1): He hoped with France \"six weeks after the start of operations\" (that would be about the 60th day of mobilization) \"to be ready, or at least so far\", that the main forces could be shifted to the East. More could not be said given the situation, as it did not depend solely on Germany whether these hopes would be fulfilled; the enemy spoke accordingly2). Thus, the prospects for the intervention of German reinforcements in the East were quite uncertain. It was not much different with the intended German advance from East Prussia against the Narew. It also depended, as General v. Moltke indicated in the concluding sentence of his 19093) commitment, on the opponent. Since their strength and readiness to attack had grown significantly in the meantime, there was no doubt that the prospects for the advance had correspondingly diminished. If the German troops in East Prussia achieved what General v. Conrad had set as the purpose of the Narew offensive, namely that they held the Russian forces deployed against East Prussia there, this had to be considered a satisfactory result given the balance of forces; only with particularly fortunate conduct of operations could more be expected.\nImmediate German support in the East was therefore not to be expected at first. Only regarding Germany's goodwill to do what was possible, there could be no doubt after the repeated assurances of the German Chief of Staff.</body>\n<footer>1) Conrad III, p. 673. \u2014 2) p. 7. \u2014 3) p. 10.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>das M\u00f6gliche zu leisten, konnte nach den wiederholten Versicherungen des deutschen Generalstabschefs wohl kein Zweifel sein.</fragment_2>", "032": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Sonst w\u00e4re General v.

Hopes could be built on this, but in the end, everything depended on the outcome of the battle in the West.\nThe situation that arose for Austria-Hungary was correctly recognized by General v. Conrad, and as he himself recounts, characterized at the meeting in Karlsbad with the earthy words: \"So we must hold our backs against Russia for at least six weeks.\" This was all the more difficult as one had to reckon with simultaneous wars against Serbia and Montenegro, was concerned about Romania's stance, and did not fully trust Italy's position.\nThus, the Danube Monarchy did not want to provoke a war against Russia due to its unforeseeable consequences; instead, it seemed desirable to settle the conflict on the Balkans alone, if it was unavoidable, as soon as possible. General v. Conrad believed that Russia would hardly allow the monarchy a free hand for such a war, even in January 1913. Despite this clear recognition of the harsh reality, the hope remained alive for him, as well as for the statesmen of Austria-Hungary, that it might still be possible to conduct such a war without Russian interference. Thus, in peacetime, alongside the deployment for war against Russia under cover against Serbia and Montenegro (Case R = Russia), a plan for a Balkan war alone (Case B = Balkan) was also continuously worked on.\nAccording to the deployment plans valid for some time, in the event of Russia, the entire army was to be mobilized immediately; slightly more than \u2158 of it was to march into Galicia, the rest to remain against Serbia.\nIn the Balkan case, initially only about \u2156 of the army was to be mobilized and mainly assembled west of the Danube against Serbia, to begin the attack from the northwest around the 15th \"mobilization day.\" This led into a mountainous country without railways and with few poor roads. It seems as if the serious dangers that had to arise for the overall military situation if Russia then intervened were underestimated. Otherwise, General v. Conrad \u2014 similar to the German Chief of General Staff, who had to decide between France and Russia \u2014 might have come to the conclusion that a deployment and especially the opening of a campaign in the Balkans was only possible if Russia's neutrality was assured.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Generalstabschef, der zwischen Frankreich und Ru\u00dfland zu entscheiden hatte \u2014 vielleicht doch zu dem Ergebnis gekommen, da\u00df ein Aufmarsch und vollends eine Feldzugser\u00f6ffnung auf dem Balkan nur m\u00f6glich sei, wenn man der Neutralit\u00e4t Ru\u00dflands sicher war.</fragment_2>", "033": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Am 25.

Conrad saw the situation, if Russia intervened in a Balkan war afterwards, as \"possible\"), but by no means hopeless. The composition of the forces designated in the \"Balkan Case\" against Serbia took this into account from the outset. These essentially consisted of a \"Minimal Group\" of 11\u00b2) infantry divisions, which also had to remain on the Balkan border in the \"Russia Case\", and a special \"B-Staffel\" with 11\u00b9/\u00b3) infantry divisions, which were intended for Galicia in the \"Russia Case\", but were to be moved there only at the end of the entire deployment movement. They could be recalled from there as long as the offensive against Serbia had not yet begun, i.e., until about the 15th \"mobilization day\". This was to happen as soon as Russia undertook the \"first hostile act (thus already the mobilization)\". If this occurred by the fifth \"mobilization day\", General v. Conrad even considered it possible to redirect the B-Staffel to Galicia without impairing the deployment against Russia\u2074). After the 15th \"mobilization day\", however, a change was no longer possible. It was best to bring the Balkan war to a decision, for which General v. Conrad estimated about two months, and until then manage with 30, perhaps even fewer divisions against Russia.\nOn June 28, 1914, the Austro-Hungarian heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, and his wife were assassinated in Sarajevo. It was a purely political crime, whose instigators were to be sought in Belgrade. Given the situation, it was hoped to settle accounts with Serbia alone. Four weeks after the murder, on July 23, the Serbian government was presented with a time-limited note, the Austro-Hungarian \"ultimatum\". On July 25, Serbia ordered mobilization and handed over to the Austro-Hungarian envoy a response that did not satisfy the Danube Monarchy.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) Letter to General v.

However, to ensure even greater superiority and thus a rapid and decisive success, an additional 3 infantry divisions and 2 Landsturm brigades were mobilized, making a total of 26 1/2 infantry divisions against the 12 Serbian and about 4 Montenegrin. The more the situation escalated in the following days, the less secure Vienna felt about Russia's stance. General v. Conrad deemed it necessary to have clarity about Russia by August 4th, at the latest August 5th 3). On July 28th, war was declared on Serbia.

In doing so, Prime Minister Count Berchtold expected the march in Galicia to also lead to war with Russia. General v. Conrad reassured him by saying, \u201cif the Russians do nothing to us, we need do nothing to them. The situation is not desperate if our own mobilization is ordered in time; initially, there would be 27\u00bd of our own infantry divisions against about 33 Russian ones.\u201d It was decided to carry out the campaign against Serbia. However, the general mobilization was only scheduled for August 1 for unknown reasons, the last permissible day considering the advancing deployment against Serbia.\nDuring these events, reports about Russia's war preparations had accumulated at the German Great General Staff in Berlin to such an extent that the delay in the Austro-Hungarian general mobilization was seen as a serious danger. As General v. Conrad reports2), Generaloberst v. Moltke urged immediate total mobilization in a telegram received early in Vienna on July 31 and also envisaged the mobilization of the German army. On this day at 11:30 a.m., Emperor Franz Joseph ordered the general mobilization for army and navy. That Russia had already ordered general mobilization on July 30 was not yet known in Vienna on July 31; rather, it was still believed that Germany might succeed in preventing Russia from intervening in the Serbian war. Thus, Emperor Franz Joseph also telegraphed to the German Emperor in the early afternoon of this day: \u201c... the ongoing action of my army against Serbia cannot be disturbed by Russia's threatening and provocative stance.\u201d\nIt was already not understood at the German General Staff when General v. Conrad announced on the morning of July 31 that he intended to carry out the war against Serbia despite the Russian partial mobilization, and the attitude of the allied monarch was understood even less, for in Berlin, the Russian general mobilization was officially reported by the ambassador from Petersburg at 11:40 a.m. There was thus no longer any doubt about Russia's intentions.</body>\n<footer>1) Conrad IV, p. 275.\n2) Ibid., p. 152 \u2014 nothing has been found about this in the German records so far.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>gemeldet worden. \u00dcber Russlands Absichten bestand somit kein Zweifel mehr.</fragment_2>", "036": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Sie konnte dann von dort, beginnend am\".

There was thus no longer any doubt about Russia's intentions.\nTherefore, the German Emperor replied at 4 p.m.\nto Emperor Franz Joseph, saying it was \"of utmost importance that Austria\ndeploys its main forces against Russia and does not become fragmented by simultaneous\noffensive against Serbia. This is all the more important as a\nlarge part of my army will be tied up by France.

However, it was decided to now\nturn the main force of the army against Russia.\nWhile General v. Conrad initially expected that\nit would suffice if he had clarity by the 5th, then by August 1,\nhe now had to determine that \"great technical difficulties arise because\nthe transports to the south are already underway, which\ncould have been inhibited two days ago\"). The start of the\nnormal deployment movement against Russia had to be delayed because the\ncompleted railway material for the Balkan deployment was prepared\nand now had to be redistributed. Thus, August 4 could only be determined as the\n\"First Mobilization Day against Russia\"2).\nApparently, to compensate for this loss of time, General\nv. Conrad now thought to halt the \"B-Staffel\" rolling south and\ndrive one of the remaining transports to Galicia. There was a\nheated discussion with the head of the field railway system, who\nexplained that any attempt would lead to chaos. There was\nno choice but to let the initiated transport movement proceed as planned3).\nWith the exception of a few units that were not yet\nin motion, the \"B-Staffel\" had to be initially driven to the Serbian\nborder.

General v. Conrad explained the reasons in a letter he addressed to Generaloberst v. Moltke on August 1: \"... We intended to conduct this war\" (against Serbia) \"in isolation without further complication. The endeavor of all powers to localize this war strengthened us in this... When Russia, by mobilizing its southern military districts, acted hostilely against the monarchy, we turned to Germany with the request to declare this action directed against us as unacceptable for Germany. At the same time, the mobilization of the rest of the army was ordered and its assembly in Galicia was envisaged. It was hoped that this measure, combined with the vigorous diplomatic pressure of the other powers, especially Germany, would deter Russia from its hostile action against the monarchy, thus giving it the opportunity to carry out the action against Serbia. We could and had to adhere even more to the idea of the offensive against Serbia in this situation, as we could expect that Russia would withdraw from the action against Serbia through a mere threat, without waging a war against us. ... From the diplomatic negotiations conducted at that time, it emerged, according to our understanding, that Germany \u2014 if we were attacked by Russia \u2014 would indeed fulfill its alliance obligation, but would prefer to avoid the great war. We therefore had to stick to our intention to continue the action against Serbia and to leave the protection against Russia, against which we alone could not open a war of aggression, to our forces assembling in Galicia, as well as to the German threat to Russia and the influence of the other powers.\"\nThis was at noon on July 31; and now, according to the existing preparations to clarify France's stance, at least 24 hours had to pass before mobilization itself could follow.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>war am 31.

In the following days, the question was whether only a partial mobilization against Austria-Hungary or the immediate general mobilization should be declared. From a political standpoint, partial mobilization was the given. However, it was allegedly not prepared and would have significantly disrupted a subsequent general mobilization. It also posed serious military dangers. On July 29, the order for general mobilization had already been signed by the Tsar, but was withdrawn immediately before its announcement and replaced by the order for partial mobilization. However, by the next afternoon, on July 30, Emperor Nicholas II finally ordered the general mobilization. July 31 was to be the first day of mobilization. In total, 114\u00bd infantry divisions and 37\u00bd cavalry divisions were mobilized2).\nRussia had to consider cooperation with allied France both in deployment and in conducting operations. Since 1892, there had been firm military agreements between the two states for wartime, with regular meetings of the general staff chiefs. There was only one view that Germany would have to seek the decision in the West and therefore would leave only very few forces against Russia. It was clear that the defeat of the German armies under all circumstances was the first and main goal of the allied armies3). However, while France was particularly early and strong in urging the deployment of Russian forces against Germany, the Russian Chief of General Staff, General Schilinski, in the years leading up to the war, believed he could not avoid \"the risk of failure on the Austrian front\".</body>\n<footer>1) Dobrorolski, Mobilization.\n2) Independent brigades are counted as \u00bd division each, independent regiments as 1/3 brigade each.

When clarity was gained on August 6 that Germany was indeed leaving only small forces in the East, the deployment plan for Austria remained in effect. It initially provided for the following distribution of forces west of the Vistula:\nagainst Germany, two armies (1st and 2nd) with 30 infantry divisions and 9\u00bd cavalry divisions, \"at the expense of the readiness of the western wing of the forces designated against Austria-Hungary, the units ready for use at the East Prussian border as quickly as possible\";\nagainst Austria-Hungary, four armies (4th, 5th, 3rd, 8th) with 46\u00bd infantry divisions and 18\u00bd cavalry divisions;\nheld back two armies (6th near Petersburg, 7th at the Romanian border) with 14\u00bd infantry divisions and 3 cavalry divisions.\nIn view of Romania's friendly stance, it was already ordered on July 29, at the outbreak of partial mobilization against Austria-Hungary, that the only active corps (VIII) from the 7th Army should immediately join the 8th Army.

General Januschkewitsch, since March 1914 the successor of General Shilinski as Chief of the General Staff, joined the Grand Duke as \"Chief of the Field Staff.\" The Supreme Headquarters was located in Petersburg until August 12 and was then to be moved to Baranowitschi (a railway junction on the Brest-Litovsk\u2014Minsk line). On the same day, the division into 2 army groups was to take place: The former Chief of the General Staff, most recently Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of the Warsaw Military District<sup>2)</sup>, General of Cavalry Shilinski, was to lead operations against Germany as Commander-in-Chief of the Northwestern Front, while the Commander-in-Chief of the Kiev Military District, General of Artillery Iwanow, was to lead operations against Austria-Hungary as Commander-in-Chief of the Southwestern Front.\nThe French had been promised the 15th day of mobilization (= August 14) as the point of readiness for an attack against East Prussia.

Serbia was also to be prompted to a swift attack. Grand Duke Nicholas readily agreed to these wishes. On August 5th, he told the French ambassador Paleologue2) \u2014 in accordance with the earlier agreement of General Sliwinski \u2014 that he intended to attack Germany (East Prussia) immediately after the assembly, probably on August 14th. He also intended, once the operation against Austria-Hungary had succeeded, to advance through Poland towards Berlin.\nOn August 7th, the Russian Supreme Command decided, as there was no longer any doubt about the small strength of the German forces remaining in the East, to partially change the ordered deployment by weakening the 1st Army on the Northwest Front and already initiating the formation of a 9th and 10th Army near Warsaw, one of which was later to advance against Thorn\u2014Posen, the other against Posen\u2014Breslau3). Initially, three corps (two from the 1st and one from the 6th Army) were to be moved forward to Warsaw as an advance guard. At the same time, the Southwest Front was weakened by the XX Corps of the 4th Army, which joined the 1st Army. Thus, 46\u00bd divisions of infantry were designated for the attack against Austria-Hungary, and 34 against Germany.\nOn August 8th and again on the 10th, instructions were given to the Northwest Front, and on the 12th to the Southwest Front, to prepare for an imminent attack. On August 13th, the Serbian Crown Prince was also urged to launch an immediate offensive4).\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) Sischowitsch, p. 31. \u2014 2) Paleologue, p. 519/20. \u2014 3) Sischowitsch, pp. 51\u201454. \u2014\n4) Ibid., pp. 37\u201441.\n</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "044": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\n- The text at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is \"Die Operationen in Ostpreu\u00dfen unter Generaloberst v.

The Defense of the German East.\n(Map 1.)\nThe German General Staff expected that the Russians would first turn against the German territory east of the Vistula. They wanted to try to hold it; however, for a longer period, this seemed feasible only under particularly favorable circumstances. The possibility that the enemy would eventually advance to the German Vistula line had to be seriously considered. However, they would probably not attack it frontally, but bypass it on Russian soil to the south. Then they would encounter the fortress of Posen. Here, however, the enemy had to be held at all costs until sufficient reinforcements arrived from the west to also go on the offensive in the east.\nAll available resources for fortification construction in the east were directed in the years before the war primarily to the fortress of Posen and the fortified Vistula-Nogat front; Thorn, Kulm, Graudenz, and Marienburg were to be expanded. This fortress front found support in the north from the Baltic Sea. Here, behind its left flank, the Danzig war harbor was fortified against the sea. In the south, the desired closure from the Vistula at Bromberg to Posen had to be abandoned due to high costs. Instead, in the event of war, a southward-directed flank was to be attached to the Vistula front over Bromberg to the west, behind Brahe and Netze, which then connected to the Warthe north of Posen. From here, a closure to the Oder was prepared. Further south along this river lay the outdated small fortress of Glogau and Breslau, which was to be expanded as an additional defense point only in the event of war. However, the whole thing was not intended as a position to be held for a long time, but primarily in the south, only as a fallback option. They wanted to go on the offensive at a suitable location as soon as possible and thereby seek a decision. The extensive bridgeheads of the Vistula line were intended to ensure the breakout over the river in a broad front.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>sollten das Hervorbrechen \u00fcber den Strom in breiter Front gew\u00e4hrleisten.</fragment_2>", "047": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Nur durch geschickte\".

The eastern railway network was thought to be further developed according to this viewpoint.\nThus, preparations were made to temporarily relinquish vast German lands east of the upper Oder, the fortress of Posen, and the lower Vistula until forces from the west could arrive.\nThe provinces of Silesia and Posen were initially the least threatened, thanks to their location. Nevertheless, it was necessary to allocate special forces here to protect the Upper Silesian coal and industrial area. Originally prepared for defense, they were eventually, as already mentioned\u00b9), following a suggestion from Austria-Hungary, designated as \"Landwehr Corps for advancing into Russia. This also secured the most vulnerable area most effectively.\nThe situation was difficult for the land east of the lower Vistula, the entire province of East Prussia, and about a third of West Prussia. This area, from Thorn to north of Memel, along an almost 600 km long border (longer than from Basel to Calais), was surrounded by Russian land from the south and east. With it, alongside its core German population, rich resources for warfare and food supply had to come into enemy hands. Also, to relieve the Austro-Hungarian ally, it was imperative to hold this area as long as possible. Yet, in this first phase of the war in the east, the available forces could not be recklessly risked. An attempt had to be made to preserve them for the later decision.\nThus, the defense of East Prussia became an extremely difficult task for the leadership, for which a satisfactory solution was not easy to find. However, the given circumstances forced the task to be set and demanded that an attempt be made to solve it.\nThe struggle of a German minority against the Russian armies attacking from both directions had often been the subject of exercises, war games, and general staff trips in peacetime. The task could not be solved by pure defense. The Russian superiority offered such extensive possibilities for outflanking that it could make any position untenable. Only through skillful exploitation of the inner line for bold and rapid attacks against a part of the enemy's superior forces could victory be expected in such a situation.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9 p. 12.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Ausnutzung der inneren Linie zu t\u00fchnem und raschem Angriff gegen einen Teil der feindlichen \u00dcbermacht war in solcher Lage ein Sieg zu erwarten.</fragment_2>", "048": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Der Conradische Gedanke, sich im schw\u00e4cheren\".

The Masurian Lakes on either side of the Boyen Fortress (L\u00f6tzen) played a special role, as they separated the Russian armies advancing from the south and east, thereby giving the defender the opportunity to deal with one Russian army after another. To further widen the separating area, a series of light fortifications had already been established in peacetime, extending westward to Ortelsburg, which were at least intended to halt the incursion of Russian cavalry masses.\nGeneral Count Schlieffen, as Chief of the General Staff, had said in 1898 during the discussion of a task concerning the defense of East Prussia against an enemy superiority of three armies: \"The German army, threatened from three sides, has nothing better to do than to attack the nearest opponent, defeat him, and then turn against one of the other two. If the Germans are held up in doubtful battles by a Russian army, the others gain time to flank and encircle their opponent and crush him with their superiority. Therefore, if the German commander did not believe he could achieve a complete victory, he did well to retreat behind the Vistula as best as he could and abandon the fulfillment of his task.\" In the same spirit, he expressed himself in 1901 regarding a similar task: \"It would have been most pleasant to retreat behind the Vistula. The task forbade the latter. Therefore, it was decided to move forward.\" As a solution, he proposed waiting in a position behind the East Prussian lakes until the Russians approached closer and were separated by the fortifications and the chain of lakes, and then to attack the next opponent \u2014 at that time the Russian Njemen army advancing from the east. These thoughts were common among the officers trained in the General Staff. To put them into action required courage and determination, which could not be expected from every leader without further ado. How easily could he be hindered in execution by the thought that the army had to be preserved for later major decisions.\nThe Conradian idea of positioning oneself in the weaker forces in the 90 km wide space between the lakes on one side and the Haff or K\u00f6nigsberg on the other, and meanwhile attacking with the mass against the fortified Narew line, would have led to being too weak at both places.

Only if the German leader in the East concentrated his limited forces could he hope for success.\nAn extensive fortification system, such as France had created on its Italian as well as its German border, would have greatly facilitated operations east of the Vistula. Especially in the naturally unprotected terrain of the southern border between Thorn and Ortelsburg, permanent works to protect the flank and the rear connections of the army would have been of decisive importance. They could secure the numerous defense sections facing east against encirclement; under their protection, an offensive warfare could then be conducted without too much risk, as all forces could fight without concern for flank and rear. A fortification of the East Prussian southern border has therefore often been considered. Most recently, in the autumn of 1913, the then commanding general of the XX Army Corps in Allenstein applied to the Chief of the General Staff of the Army. However, all such wishes had to be set aside as long as the funds for the more important purposes of expanding Posen and the Vistula positions were just sufficient.\nThe same was true for the desire for further expansion of L\u00f6tzen and K\u00f6nigsberg, which protected against the east. In this direction, however, the terrain at least offered favorable possibilities for defense: North of the lakes, the Angerapp and then the course of the Alle were given as defense sections. To them was connected, north of the Pregel, the Deime line, envisaged as a representation of the fortress K\u00f6nigsberg. Behind it, a lagoon connection position was planned from the fortress to the north. All these positions were only explored in peacetime. In 1914, the German army in East Prussia had to try to solve its task even without the advantages that an extensive network of permanent fortifications could have offered. This increased the risk that the campaign would end prematurely with the retreat behind the Vistula.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "050": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"L\u00e4\u00dft sich, auch unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung der weiter n\u00f6rdlich befindlichen russischen Kr\u00e4fte, eine Offensive in s\u00fcd\u00f6stlicher Richtung, etwa \u00f6stlich Warschau vorbei, erm\u00f6glichen, so sei darauf hingewiesen, da\u00df der Narew\u201c und seine Befestigungen f\u00fcr die 8.

For its use, the 8th Army must be more closely assembled. The use of railways was prepared for this purpose.\nThe army was assigned a \"difficult task\": the \"securing of our eastern provinces against a Russian incursion,\" for which \"only the overall situation after the readiness of the 8th Army can be decisive,\" as well as the \"support of the offensive intended by Austria.\"\nFor this purpose, the Landwehr Corps was to advance immediately in connection with the Austro-Hungarian left wing and be led \"relentlessly\" forward. It was therefore independent in its operations. However, the High Command of the 8th Army, to which the corps remained subordinate, was to \"exert its full influence\" to ensure that the advance of the Landwehr Corps did not stall.\n\"The offensive intended by Austria\" \u2014 it was then stated further \u2014 \"will be most effectively supported if the 8th Army succeeds in binding as many forces as possible from the northern and western Russian army groups, thereby diverting them from the Austrian army and facilitating the first battle for it.

However, if the Russians initially remain waiting or explicitly defensive against Germany, then a Russian offensive into Russia by the 8th Army will bind strong Russian forces and prevent reinforcement of the army parts deployed against Austria. The general situation must be decisive for the direction of this offensive. If, even considering the Russian forces further north, an offensive in a southeasterly direction, perhaps past east of Warsaw, is possible, it should be noted that the Narew and its fortifications are an insurmountable obstacle for the 8th Army.\"\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>windlichen Hindernisse bieten.</fragment_2>", "051": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"In diesem Sinne lie\u00df er dem Grafen Waldersee auftragen, noch am 14.

Prittwitz and Gaffron, previously General Inspector of the 1st Army Inspection in Danzig, as the commander of the German 8th Army. Joining him as Chief of Staff was Major General Count v. Waldersee, who had previously been in charge of the departments dealing with the German deployment as Quartermaster General in the Great General Staff. Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann, a precise connoisseur of the Russian army, who had participated in the war in East Asia on the Japanese side, was appointed as the 1st General Staff Officer, the executor and advisor to the Chief for all operational and tactical matters. Major General Gr\u00fcnert was tasked as Quartermaster General with handling all matters not directly falling into the area of operations, but was also consulted by General v. Prittwitz in decisive decisions.\nWhen Generaloberst v. Prittwitz was briefed in Berlin shortly before the outbreak of war about the task of the 8th Army, Generaloberst v. Moltke had, among other things, again pointed out that the 8th Army must not allow itself to be pushed away from the Vistula. If solving the task east of the Vistula was no longer possible, then at least the army must be preserved. However, Generaloberst v. Moltke did not expect the imminent occurrence of such an \"extreme emergency\" as a probability; rather, he expected that the knowledge available at the Great General Staff about the Russian army, that the small German forces, with skillful leadership, would be able to withstand a strong Russian superiority for a longer time.

By then, the remaining parts of the army would have completed their assembly in the staging area in western Poland.\nThe border defense was initially in the hands of the active border corps. As soon as these moved westward, they were later taken over by second-line troops. Under this protection, the following were to assemble:\nThe Landwehr Corps in Silesia and Posen, with one division each at the border opposite Tschenstochau and Kalisch,\nthe 6th Landwehr Brigade at Gnesen,\nthe 3rd Reserve Division at Hohensalza,\nthe 70th Landwehr Brigade at G\u00f6slershausen,\nthe XVII Army Corps (Danzig) at Deutsch-Eylau, with border defense units from Thorn to west of Soldau,\nthe XX Army Corps (Allenstein) at Allenstein, with border defense units subsequently to the XVII Army Corps south of M\u00e4rgrabowa,\nthe I Reserve Corps at Nordenburg,\nthe I Army Corps (K\u00f6nigsberg) at Gumbinnen, with border defense units subsequently to the XX Army Corps to the Baltic Sea,\nthe 1st Cavalry Division east of Gumbinnen,\nthe 2nd Landwehr Brigade at Tilsit.\nAdditionally, the 8th Army's high command was in charge of the deputy general commands bordering Russia of the VI (Breslau), V (Posen), II (Stettin), XVII (Danzig), XX (Allenstein), and I (K\u00f6nigsberg) Army Corps, as well as the fortresses located in their areas. As long as these fortresses were not directly threatened, the field army could be reinforced from them. For this, the following were considered: from Posen, Thorn, and K\u00f6nigsberg about one division each, from Breslau and Graudenz about one mixed brigade each, all with strong heavy artillery, then some battalions from the fortifications of Kulm, Marienburg, and Danzig.

The timing depended on the provision of the Landsturm units designated for relief and was also influenced by the state of armament.\nOf the mentioned troop formations, only the three active army corps, the I Reserve Corps, the 3rd Reserve Division, and the 1st Cavalry Division were equipped as full-fledged \"field troops\" for combat in open terrain. For all other formations, the equipment was initially tailored only for local use. They lacked machine guns, field kitchens, observation and telephone equipment, as well as light columns of field artillery, bridge trains, medical formations, and ammunition and supply columns. For the fortress troops, the provision of war maps mostly did not extend beyond the vicinity of the fortress itself. Procuring the missing items was only gradually achieved during the campaign. Until then, these troops partly suffered from a lack of essentials and, apart from their less favorable composition, also lagged in performance compared to other formations. Nevertheless, the same was required of all of them, given the small number of total forces, as from the active and reserve troops.\n3. The Development of the Situation During the German Deployment.\n(Source 1, p. 44.)\nOn August 1st at 6 p.m. (\u2014 7 p.m. Russian time), the German ambassador Count Pourtal\u00e8s delivered the declaration of war in Petersburg. Just two hours later, a small Russian Cossack detachment occupied the German post office in Klein-Szullainen (on the border south of L\u00f6tzen), another was turned away on August 2nd in the morning on German territory near Sch\u00f6na (20 km southeast of Soldau) by German cuirassier posts. Both Russian detachments had crossed the border before they could be aware of the state of war. For the German troops, permission to cross the border against Russia had not yet been granted. The Supreme Army Command only granted it on the morning of August 2nd after receiving reports of the Russian border crossings.\nThe protection of the Upper Silesian industrial area was now advanced onto Russian soil.

The task prioritized in Moltke's deployment instructions for the 8th Army, to protect the eastern provinces against a Russian invasion, was not mentioned in it; it had receded in favor of the viewpoint to \"maintain the Vistula as a base.\" This should not be concluded that Colonel General v. Prittwitz and his Chief of Staff had rejected the protection of East Prussia and were already considering an early retreat behind the Vistula. That was not the case; rather, it was precisely Colonel General v. Prittwitz who caused the planned piercing of the dikes for the flooding of the Nogat lowlands, scheduled for the first days after mobilization preparations, to be postponed indefinitely. He wanted to try to carry out his task as the deployment instructions corresponded, but he had \u2014 not unjustified \u2014 doubts whether he could solve it with the available forces.\nThe deployment of the 8th Army's units proceeded without any disturbance from the enemy. The High Command emphatically pursued their reinforcement through parts of the fortress garrisons from K\u00f6nigsberg and from the Vistula line. The Russians had withdrawn their troops almost everywhere from the border. The feared early incursion of large enemy cavalry masses did not occur, although particularly good prospects would have been offered to it in the first days of mobilization in East Prussia. Later, such an undertaking became more hopeless and thus more unlikely from day to day. The Russian 4th Cavalry Division, which advanced alone against Bialla (30 km southwest of Lyck) on August 9, was repelled by the border guard of the XX Army Corps with the loss of 6 guns. On the other hand, there were costly raids by the population in Lichenstchau and to an even greater extent in Kalisch \u2014 possibly instigated by Russian agents \u2014 on German militia troops. Strict measures were the result.\nOn August 10, the deployment of the German forces initially available for the East was completed.\nThe bulk of the Austro-Hungarian army, under Archduke Friedrich of Austria with General v. Conrad as Chief of Staff, began their deployment in East Galicia, to proceed to the offensive between the Bug and Vistula on August 20 or 22; a left wing group was to set out from Krakow even earlier.</body>\n<footer>World War.

As a representative of the Austro-Hungarian army, Field Marshal Lieutenant Count St\u00fcrgkh arrived at the German Supreme Army Command, while the German Lieutenant General Baron von Freytag-Loringhoven was at the Austro-Hungarian Army High Command1). The personal adjutant of General von Conrad, Captain in the General Staff Fleischmann von Theissruck, was present as a liaison officer at the headquarters of the German 8th Army.\nThe German Landwehr Corps closed in at Czestochowa and Kalisz to accompany the advance of the allies on the northern flank, starting on August 15.\nOn the Baltic Sea, Grand Admiral Prince Heinrich of Prussia took command. However, he had only insignificant forces at his disposal. Since the Russians held back completely, a threat to the German 8th Army from the sea was not initially considered. Likewise, given the overall situation in the East, no significant support for German land operations from the fleet could be expected.\nThe mobilization and deployment of the Russian army seemed to proceed according to plan. How far both had progressed could not be precisely determined.\nThe distribution of Russian forces seemed to correspond to previous assumptions: The larger part of the Russian army marched against the Austrian border east of the Vistula, while western Poland seemed to be cleared of stronger forces. Against East Prussia, since 1910, the start of a campaign was expected with the deployment of a Russian army with 5 corps, 7\u00bd cavalry divisions, and 1 reserve division at the Narew, another with 4 corps, 2\u00bd cavalry divisions, and 1 reserve division at the Niemen, as well as weaker forces north of this river. In total, this initially amounted to at least 20 infantry and about 10 cavalry divisions. According to calculations by the German General Staff from July 30, 1914, the two Russian armies could be operational in this strength by the Russian 16th mobilization day (August 15).\nMeanwhile, however, the development of the situation in the West necessitated the originally planned for the East to be reconsidered.

Thus, it was to be expected that the strength ratios in the battle for East Prussia would initially be particularly unfavorable. They would initially face each other:\nGermans:\n6 active infantry divisions,\n3 reserve divisions,\n1\u00bd Landwehr divisions (3 mixed brigades),\n2\u00bd fortress troop divisions (Landwehr and replacement troops from the eastern fortresses excluding Breslau and Posen),\ntogether at most\n13 infantry divisions (less than half active),\n1 cavalry division.\nRussians:\n19 active infantry divisions (including 2 rifle brigades),\n2 reserve divisions,\ntogether at least\n21 infantry divisions (nine-tenths active),\nabout 10 cavalry divisions.\nIn a comparison of the combat strength on both sides, the active German infantry divisions could be considered roughly equal to the Russian ones. However, while the Russian reserve divisions were equal to the Russian active divisions, the German reserve divisions and even more so the formations made up of Landwehr and fortress troops lagged far behind the German active divisions in combat strength. It was also to be considered that the Russian active and reserve troops were quite equal to the Germans in terms of armament and ammunition, equipment of men and horses, and other war equipment, but were significantly superior to our Landwehr and fortress troops. All in all, the Russian side had a probably double numerical superiority.\nThis had to become even greater with the arrival of further active corps from the interior and reserve divisions. On the German side, however, no increase in strength was to be expected for the foreseeable future.\nIf the German Supreme Army Command nevertheless took on the responsibility of opposing the Russian superiority with such small and partly not even fully effective forces, it was only brought to this by bitter necessity.

Waldersee initially wanted to turn against the Russian army using the railway network, which first came within range. If it was the Narew Army, they could attack it without endangering their own rear connections. Such an attack, directed towards Pultusk, thus against the Narew, met the wishes of the Austrians and also covered their own eastern front. If the enemy did not attack here, they could make an air strike to then come against the Russian Njemen Army from behind the German forces. Therefore, they had to turn against the Njemen Army if it appeared first, while the Narew Army still held back. Such an attack exposed the right flank to the Narew Army; their advance brought the rear connections into very serious danger. If a quick and complete success was not achieved, the situation described by Count Schlieffen in 1898 could arise, where they would have to abandon their task and retreat behind the Vistula. Nevertheless, the commander of the 8th Army was determined to proceed against the Njemen Army if it appeared first on the scene.\nThat this case would occur was considered likely by the Army High Command of the 8th Army as early as August 9. Major General Count v. Waldersee reported at that time to the Supreme Army Command that the cautious behavior of the Russian cavalry against the East Prussian southern border, as well as the enemy's railway and bridge destructions in front of its left wing, made an advance from the Narew unlikely for the time being.

The commander-in-chief therefore wanted to prepare his army to \"launch an attack from the area of the Angerapp north of Angerburg during the advance of the Wilna Army, utilizing the lake terrain,\" and later, after this enemy had been shaken off, to turn south depending on circumstances. However, the prerequisite for the attack against the Njemen Army was that a threat from the advance of strong Russian forces from the line Przasnysz\u2014Ostrolenka was \"excluded.\" Compared to Schlieffen's ideas, this prerequisite represented a certain weakening. The area of L\u00f6tzen, it was said \u2014 again entirely in the Schlieffen sense \u2014 should further form the pivot and support point for all upcoming operations in East Prussia.\nAccordingly, the army high command moved the 3rd Reserve Division and the 6th Landwehr Brigade from the area south of Bromberg to L\u00f6tzen in the next few days, where they arrived on August 12 and 13. The fortress, whose facilities had to be expanded with field fortifications, as well as the 6th Landwehr Brigade, were placed under the command of the commander of the 3rd Reserve Division. In connection with the lakes to the north, the I Reserve Corps had to expand the Angerapp position.\nGeneraloberst v. Prittwitz refrained from deploying the entire army behind the lakes, as Graf Schlieffen had once recommended, but also from the particularly effective attack direction from there and the possibility of deploying the entire strength of the army for a decisive blow. Thus, the German forces remained distributed east of the Vistula as follows:\nwith the front to the south: 70th Landwehr Brigade, XVII Army Corps, XX Army Corps;\nin the lake area near L\u00f6tzen: 3rd Reserve Division, 6th Landwehr Brigade;\nwith the front to the east: I Reserve Corps, I Army Corps, 1st Cavalry Division, 2nd Landwehr Brigade.\nThe border protection was still in the hands of the active army corps as before.\nThe army high command thought that if an attack against the Njemen Army were to occur soon, it would deploy the strongest possible forces for this, but also ensure its connections to the Vistula were sufficiently secured against the Narew Army. Therefore, in such a case, it saw alongside troops from the Vistula fortifications, which would be in division strength, the XVII Army Corps to be relieved, the entire active XX Army Corps and the 70th Landwehr Brigade to protect the southern border.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>XVII.

Only the XVII Army Corps was to be brought to the eastern front by rail. Furthermore, a new, albeit weak, division was to be formed from the main reserve of the K\u00f6nigsberg fortress (9th Landwehr Brigade) at Insterburg by adding replacement troop units of the I Army Corps. Including all reserve, replacement, and Landwehr troops and the main reserve from Thorn, 4 infantry divisions were planned for defense against the south, and about 9 infantry divisions and 1 cavalry division for the attack against the east.\nThe strike against the Njemen Army could not be carried out arbitrarily far to the east. Seeking out the enemy in his own country was forbidden, even with the greatest calm of leadership, due to the threat to the rear connections by the Narew Army. So one had to wait, like it or not, until the Njemen Army came within reach and accept all the disadvantages associated with such waiting. On the other hand, the blow should be able to annihilate the enemy, because only then would it be possible to turn with full force to the south against the Narew Army. It seemed most favorable to the command if it succeeded in letting the Russians run at the Angerapp and then, encompassing them from the south and north, to strike them before they came, the deeper the better, for there was not much time to lose in the situation of the 8th Army. These thoughts formed the basis for the further measures of the army command.\nThe commanding general of the I Army Corps, Lieutenant General v. Fran\u00e7ois, who was entrusted with border protection against the east, viewed the situation significantly differently than the army command. For more than a year, he had been dealing with the question of how he could repel the enemy at the start of the war as the commanding general in K\u00f6nigsberg. He considered the protection of the province of East Prussia against enemy incursions as his foremost task and had expressed on various occasions the idea that he would protect the province with his corps against such incursions. The instruction drawn up by the Great General Staff for covering the deployment of the 8th Army had now tasked him with taking the necessary measures to secure his corps district. General v. Fran\u00e7ois had set himself the high goal of repelling the Russians despite the great extent of the border already in this. To this end, he wanted to confront the enemy wherever he appeared, to seek him out possibly in his own country.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>m\u00f6glich in seinem eigenen Lande aufsuchen.</fragment_2>", "062": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Am 10.

This corresponded to his low estimation of the Russians as well as his willingness to take responsibility. Additionally, the instruction from the General Staff, which corresponded to a suggestion already made by General v. Fran\u00e7ois in peacetime, explicitly recommended short offensive thrusts across the border. Thus, \"enemy locations near the border, e.g., Tauroggen and Mitau, and the border posts should be attacked as much as possible.\" Based on these considerations, General v. Fran\u00e7ois was now determined to act. Reports of successes in the initial border skirmishes strengthened his conviction that he was on the right path. He had firm confidence that his I. Army Corps could also engage a significantly superior enemy.\nThis Army Corps was to assemble according to the deployment instructions at Gumbinnen in Insterburg. However, since General v. Fran\u00e7ois was also in charge of the I. Reserve Corps, which was deploying at the Angerapp, as well as the 1st Cavalry Division and the 2nd Landwehr Brigade, he saw no reason to prevent deploying the majority of his own Army Corps for operations at the border. For August 9, he planned an attack with the bulk of the corps against the enemy at Wirballen. The troops were to be advanced from the assigned deployment area towards the border.\nGeneraloberst v. Prittwitz had already learned of this intention on August 6, the day before he took command. He could not approve of General v. Fran\u00e7ois's intention, which went far beyond the scope of a border protection operation. The corps seemed exposed to a partial defeat with the progress of the Russian assembly. Through a battle of the I. Army Corps at Wirballen, the entire army could be drawn into unwanted paths before it was assembled. Generaloberst v. Prittwitz had therefore prohibited all commanding generals from making changes to the once-ordered deployment through the directive already mentioned\u00b9) from August 6. On the evening of August 7, he also issued the special order to the I. Army Corps to \"remain with the main force at the Angerapp\" until further notice. To protect the area east of the Angerapp, the 1st Cavalry Division should be reinforced by small mixed detachments if necessary. On August 10, the commander-in-chief deemed it necessary to personally order General v. Fran\u00e7ois again by telephone: \"I absolutely forbid any forward movements of closed units towards the border over the Gumbinnen\u2014Goldap line until further notice.\"</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) p. 48.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>\u201eVorbewegungen geschlossener Abteilungen gegen die Grenze \u00fcber die Linie Gumbinnen\u2014Goldap verbiete ich bis auf weiteres unbedingt.\u201c</fragment_2>", "063": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"nur die 1.

Prittwitz, however, could not decide to resolve the existing differences of opinion through personal discussion with the Commanding General of the I Army Corps.\nDespite the unmistakable instructions of the Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant General v. Fran\u00e7ois remained firm in his intentions. The deployment at the Angerapp and near Gumbinnen\u2014Insterburg seemed to him to give up so much German land. Doubts also arose in him as to whether the Army High Command would later find the right time to transition from this deployment to attack. He wanted to pull forward what he considered the proper army leadership and therefore began to advance his entire corps to the line Goldap\u2014Stallup\u00f6nen for the protection of the border.

The troops from Warsaw were to depart eastward, the city being almost devoid of soldiers. The funds were said to have been transferred, the banks closed, and the railway administration relocated to Brest-Litovsk.\nAlso north of Warsaw, the initially quite strong Russian advance troops had been withdrawn everywhere behind the Narew-Bobr line, and the railway lines in front of their front had been destroyed. At Mlawa, the cavalry divisions 15 and 6, which had already been stationed in northern Poland in peacetime, were still present. To clarify the situation, the advance troops of the German 36th Infantry Division (XVII Army Corps) advanced against them on August 12 with the consent of the Army High Command, and on the 13th the entire division followed. The Russian cavalry already evaded the German advance troops and retreated over Ciechanow. The Germans occupied Mlawa. \u2014 Of the fortified places north of Warsaw, only Nowogeorgiewsk was initially reported to be occupied by troops. In Ostrolenka, troops and rolling stock were first identified on the evening of August 13. Lomsha seemed weakly occupied according to earlier reports, and fortifications were being worked on around Osowiec, which was important terrain for the cooperation of the Russian Narew and Njemen armies north of this fortress.\nOverall, the Army High Command had the impression that a Russian advance from the Narew was not initially to be expected.\nThis view coincided with that of the Supreme Army Command. It assumed behind the Narew and Bobr: at Nowogeorgiewsk half of the Russian XXIII Corps, \u2014 at and southwest of Lomsha the XV, \u2014 around Osowiec the VI Corps, \u2014 in front of them the 15th, 6th, and 4th Cavalry Divisions, \u2014 in total thus 2\u00bd corps and 3 cavalry divisions, all troops from northern Poland, of which at least one corps was initially bound as a security garrison for the fortresses. \u2014 Also in front of the East Prussian eastern front, the Supreme Army Command assumed only the Russian corps already stationed there in peacetime: the one around Olita to the south, in front of it the advance troops at Augustow, \u2014 the IV half-Russian around Olita to the south, in front of it the 5th Rifle Brigade, \u2014 the III and \u00bd XX at Kowno, further distributed along the entire front: the 2nd Cavalry Division from Suwalki, the 1st from Moscow, transported by rail to Suwalki, and the 3rd Cavalry Division stationed in peacetime along the Wirballen\u2014Wilna line, in total thus 7\u00be corps, 3 cavalry divisions.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "065": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Eine Meldung des I.

However, based on the daily incoming reports, a somewhat different view had formed regarding the distribution of Russian forces on the Eastern Front: At Suwalki, in addition to the troops assumed by the Supreme Army Command in this area, the 3rd Cavalry Division, which was stationed further north in peacetime, was identified. In contrast, the 1st and 2nd Guard Cavalry Divisions from Petersburg appeared at Wirballen. From the radio traffic between the 3rd Cavalry Division and the III Corps and from movements to the south that had been observed, it seemed to indicate that the III Corps was also being moved south from Wilna. An aviator reported strong forces in bivouacs on the road Olita\u2014Suwalki and west of Suwalki on August 11, which he \u2014 although also according to the army command's view rather high \u2014 estimated at 4 to 5 divisions. West of Olita, artillery unloadings were observed, north of the road from there to Kalwaria one to two cavalry divisions in bivouacs. In addition, agent reports and prisoner statements confirmed the assembly of strong forces around Suwalki and anticipated an imminent advance from there. From all this, the command gained the overall impression that the enemy was assembling strong forces in front of the southern part of the Eastern Front, around Suwalki. In contrast, further north, apart from the mentioned cavalry at Wirballen and border protection, no enemy troops seemed to be present. The aviators repeatedly reported that in and north of the line Wischtynjez\u2014Mariampol up to beyond the railway line Wirballen\u2014Wilna, as far as the population allowed insight, all places and roads were free. North of the Njemen, the previous border protection, parts of the XX Corps and the 1st Independent Cavalry Brigade, were still detected. Thus, the army command gained the picture that the Russian Njemen Army, with its northern wing, was assembling around Kalwaria to begin the advance against the Sengebiet.\nThis perception seemed to be confirmed when the enemy advanced in a broad front from the Suwalki area on the morning of August 14. Even early that morning, the commander-in-chief of the 8th Army had not been entirely sure whether he would indeed launch the first strike against the Njemen Army. He had also considered the possibility of having to deal with the Narew Army first. A report from the I Army Corps was decisive: While no changes had been detected at the Narew until then, this report indicated that stronger enemy forces had broken through the border east of Margrabowa in a 25 km width.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>ergab diese Meldung, da\u00df st\u00e4rkerer Feind \u00f6stlich Margrabowa in 25 km Breite \u00fcber die Grenze eingebrochen sei.</fragment_2>", "066": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Wenn auch die M\u00f6glichkeit bestand, sich aus ihr nach Bedarf noch zu verschieben, so war dies doch in erster Linie auf den erwarteten Vormarsch der russischen Masse s\u00fcdlich der Romintenischen\"\n<fragment_1>Wenn auch die M\u00f6glichkeit bestand, sich aus ihr nach Bedarf noch zu verschieben, so war dies doch in erster Linie auf den erwarteten Vormarsch der russischen Masse s\u00fcdlich der Romintenischen</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"zugeschnitten.

In front of the Wischtyniesz\u2013Schirwindt line, however, everything was calm, and the roads leading from Kalwaria and Mariampol were continuously free of enemy infantry.\nImmediately after this report was received, Generaloberst v. Prittwitz ordered at 9:15 a.m. the transport of the XVII Army Corps, prepared for several days, to the eastern front in the area of Insterburg. It was thus decided that the first move would be against the Njemen Army. Deploying the XX Army Corps in this direction was considered inadvisable due to the need to protect the southern border. The absence of the expected five replacement divisions was noticeable.\nAgainst the Narew Army, instead of the XVII Army Corps, a mixed detachment from the fortresses of Thorn and Graudenz was to take over the protection of the border at Strasburg and Lautenburg. The 70th Landwehr Brigade was to occupy Soldau and Mlawa, and the Deputy General Command of the XVII Army Corps was to send two battalions from Danzig to Neidenburg. All these troops were placed under the command of Generalmajor v. Unger (Fritz). East of them, the XX Army Corps was to move into the area of Ortelsburg. It was responsible for covering the army against any Russian advance west of the lakes, while also keeping in mind the possibility of advancing eastward over Johannisburg for an attack.\nOn the eastern front, the 3rd Reserve Division, together with the 6th Landwehr Brigade, was to hold the line Aidsnicken\u2013L\u00f6tzen between the lakes. While the enemy was engaged on the right flank, Generaloberst v. Prittwitz intended to prepare his main forces north of the lakes for an attack: here, the I Reserve Corps was initially to hold the Angerapp line as before. The XVII Army Corps was to be moved from its unloading stations at Insterburg to Darkehmen. The I Army Corps, with the 1st Cavalry Division remaining under its command, was to remain at Gumbinnen\u2013Insterburg, with the main reserve from K\u00f6nigsberg assembled behind the left flank at Insterburg, while the 2nd Landwehr Brigade was to continue holding the Memel line.\nThis deployment could likely be completed by August 18.

It was less appropriate if the Russian northern wing, as the Supreme Army Command had assumed, extended further north or was extended by newly arriving reinforcements. Since the only double-track railway leading from the interior of Russia to the East Prussian border ran from Vilna via Kovno to Wirballen, such a possibility could not be dismissed. After all, the two Petersburg Guard Cavalry Divisions had just arrived on this railway. However, the numerous reconnaissance results available to the Army High Command countered such concerns.\nOn the evening of August 14, Major General Count v. Waldersee reported to the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army that it was hardly doubtful that the Russian forces identified from south of Augustow to the Rominten Heath were the \"Rennenkampf Army.\" The impression prevailed that a Russian advance against our lake line was being prepared. \"As little as such an advance can be considered independent, it can, on the other hand, not be regarded as entirely unlikely according to the Russian ideas known here1). The capture of Mlawa by the XVII Army Corps and the repulsion of the enemy cavalry corps to Zjechanowo will have been the impetus for the advance. \u2014 This opens up the possibility for the 8th Army to launch a sudden strike against the flank of the Russian northern wing.\"\nA request received at the High Command on the same evening from Vienna to advance southwards to reach Siedlce as soon as possible could not be considered in view of the situation described in front of the 8th Army's front. The Austro-Hungarian liaison officer replied to General v. Conrad in the sense of the High Command that an attack against the east would first be carried out, which \"should take place in the very next few days. Only then can operations against Siedlce be initiated\"2).\nOn the morning of August 15, it turned out that the enemy, who had advanced in a broad front from the Suwalki area on the morning of the 14th, had not crossed the Marggrabowa\u2014Goldap railway, and soon after, reports came in that he voluntarily retreated back across the border.\n</body>\n<footer>\n1) Close connection to the Narew Army and concern about the K\u00f6nigsberg fortress, from which one therefore wanted to deviate.\n2) Conrad IV, C. 389.\n</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>hatte, und bald darauf kamen Meldungen, da\u00df er freiwillig wieder \u00fcber die Grenze zur\u00fcckgehe.</fragment_2>", "068": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"den Vormarsch hatten die Russen bisher noch nicht angetreten.

It was learned that it was the Russian 1st Cavalry Division, reinforced by parts of the 5th Rifle Brigade, that had undertaken a violent reconnaissance here.\nBy the evening of August 16, further reports came in that, together with the retreat of the enemy at Marggrabowa, could change the picture that had been made so far: In Warsaw, two regiments from the I Corps (from the area south of Petersburg) had arrived, Ostrolenka was fully occupied, south of Lomsha was about an infantry division. The deployment of the Narew Army seemed to begin. North of the Narew-Bobr course, however, everything was still free as before. At Augustow, not much enemy was expected, the troops were supposed to have moved north from there. The commander of the 3rd Reserve Division, Major General v. Morgen, reported early on August 16 that he assumed the southern wing of the Russian Njemen Army at Suwalki. Unfortunately, due to unfavorable weather, the air reconnaissance had no results on August 15 and 16, but there were other reports: East of the Rominten Heath, the Russians had made an advance across the border on August 16. In Wilkowischki, according to an intercepted Russian radio message, there were wounded from a regiment of the Russian 30th Infantry Division (IV Corps, Minsk). At Kibarty west of Wirballen, infantry of the 28th Infantry Division (XX Corps) was still detected on August 15. A few kilometers north of there, however, a battalion of the Russian 25th Infantry Division (III Corps) was repelled by the German border guard the next day. The two Russian Guard Cavalry Divisions were confirmed north of Wirballen. According to prisoner statements, the Guard Rifle Brigade was also expected here. Strong cavalry had ridden north from Schirwindt on August 16. Spillenken had been occupied by Russian cavalry.\nAfter all, doubts could arise as to whether the Russian northern wing was really in front of the Rominten Heath and whether it might even be sought north of the Wirballen-Kowno area. In any case, troops of the III, IV, III, and XX Russian Corps had to be expected on the eastern front from Suwalki to Wirballen, as well as the 1st and 2nd Guard and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Cavalry Divisions, further north still with the 1st Independent Cavalry Brigade, in total with 4 corps and 5\u00bd cavalry divisions. The Russians had not yet begun the advance. However, it might be imminent, because for the violent reconnaissance at Marggrabowa, according to captured Russian orders, the destruction of railways and bridges had been expressly forbidden.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>erbeuteten russischen Befehlen die Zerst\u00f6rung von Bahnen und Br\u00fccken ausdr\u00fccklich verboten gewesen.</fragment_2>", "069": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die gegen Deutschland angesetzte Heeresgruppe der Nordwestfront, unter General Schilinski als Oberbefehlshaber mit Generalleutnant Oranowski, seinem bisherigen Stabschef aus Warschau, als\".

The German attack could then only lead to a frontal battle, at best to a pushing back of the Njemen Army. If this army was considered a somewhat equal opponent, it would soon be on the heels of the German 8th Army again in such an outcome of the battle; the freedom of action needed against the Narew Army was not gained. Also, the German I Corps was initially alone in the area assigned to it between Insterburg and Gumbinnen, perhaps directly facing a superior enemy. \u2014 If the situation was viewed this way, it was now necessary to push the German left wing further north and strengthen it. There was still time for this. Between the lakes, one could make oneself significantly weaker, as well as behind the Angerapp. It would have been quite possible to prepare two active army corps for an attack on and north of the K\u00f6nigsberg\u2014Kowno railway.\nHowever, at the 8th Army's high command, the news received by the evening of August 16, regarding the enemy's extension northward, was assessed differently: On August 15, Count Waldersee had written to General v. Stein at the Great Headquarters that, despite the Russians' retreat from Marggrabowa, he still expected an imminent breakthrough south of the Rominten Heath. \"Nothing better could happen to us.\" This perception remained at the army high command. Thus, it adhered to the once initiated deployment unchanged. On August 16, the army headquarters was moved closer to the front, to Bartenstein, for the upcoming battles.\n</body>\n<header>3.

Outside this deployment area, the following were initially designated as security garrisons: from the XXIII Corps, the 3rd Guards Infantry Division for the area of Grodno, the 2nd Infantry Division for Nowogeorgiewsk, and the 1st Rifle Brigade for Warsaw. The 6th and 15th Cavalry Divisions were to remain at Mlawa in front of the left army wing.\nThis assembly of the armies of the Russian Northwestern Front, three or more days' marches from the border, relying on the sections of the Njemen, Bobr, and Narew, which were further reinforced by permanent fortifications, was initially intended for the defense against any potential early German attack, which was never without concern despite their own superiority. If such an attack did not occur by the completion of their own deployment, they intended to attack with the 1st Army to the north, with the 2nd to the west of the Masurian Lakes, the right wing of this army advancing over Johannisburg to Gensburg. Naval operations could have supported this approach. However, it seems they were not intended. In fact, the weak Russian Baltic Fleet remained completely inactive.\nOn land, a certain caution was undoubtedly justified at first, considering that the Russian deployment could only be somewhat completed by August 20. Such restraint, however, did not correspond to the repeatedly mentioned needs of the French, who, pointing to the weak strength of the German forces in the East, had repeatedly demanded more rapid action. On August 8, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, as the Supreme Commander, in accordance with the commitments made to France, pointed out to the Northwestern Front Command that \"to relieve the French,\" an attack must be initiated at the first opportunity, albeit ensuring numerical superiority. To ascertain the enemy's forces, decisive measures were to be taken. As preparation for the later intended general attack against Germany, the Supreme Commander also ordered at the same time the already mentioned\u00b9) formation of the 2nd Army at Warsaw, which was subordinated to the Northwestern Front. From this army, initially, three Petersburg Corps (Guards Corps, I and XVIII Corps), as well as the Caucasian Cavalry Division and parts of the 1st Turkestan Cossack Division, were to be deployed at and west of Warsaw.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>und westlich Warschau versammelt werden.</fragment_2>", "072": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Der\".

At the same time, he ordered the extension of the 2nd Army's western flank to Ostrolenka. The XIII Corps, initially positioned at Bielostok, was to be advanced there.\nOn August 10, the following order from the Russian Supreme Command in Petersburg arrived for the Northwestern Front:\n\"Strength of the 1st and 2nd Army on the evening of the 12th day of mobilization\" (= August 11) \"208 battalions, 228 squadrons, whereas 4 German corps (100 battalions) with some reserve and landwehr formations.

However, the III Corps was to wait with the attack against the Angerapp and lake line until the XX, with the involvement of field troops used in the Riga-Schaulen group and the IV Corps, which was four days delayed, were also present.

This change meant a very strong leftward shift, with the corps having to cover up to 140 km on poor cross-connections behind the border in the road-poor country, so that they could not cross it before August 19. This gave the 1st Army the time advantage it needed for later cooperation with the 2nd Army, as it had the longer route and more difficult attack terrain.\nThe intentions of the army group were announced to the armies on August 13 through a \"directive\" for the attack: The enemy is in East Prussia with advance guards at the border, with the main forces behind the lake line. The task of the 1st and 2nd Army is: \"to proceed to the decisive attack, to destroy the enemy, to cut him off from K\u00f6nigsberg and to block his way to the Vistula.\" He was to be enveloped simultaneously in the north and west.\nFor this, the 1st Army was to cross the border from the Wirballen\u2014Suwalki line with the cavalry on the 16th, and the rest on August 17, advancing north of the Masurian Lakes towards Insterburg\u2014Angerburg and \"after crossing the Angerapp, deeply envelop the left flank of the Germans to cut them off from K\u00f6nigsberg.\" The cavalry of the army was to ride into the rear of the Germans, among other things, to prevent the continuation of the rolling railway material.

It could be considered by the Russians as the beginning of a German attack, but at least it showed that the German right wing with strong forces stood considerably further west than previously assumed. Therefore, the commander-in-chief decided to extend the western wing of the 2nd Army accordingly. He designated the first arriving parts of the future 9th Army for this purpose. Thus, troops of the I Corps were brought forward via Warsaw on the route to Mlawa up to Ziechano\u0301w, the 5th Cavalry Division and the Guard Corps were to follow there. These forces were to be used by the army group command on the western wing of the 2nd Army in the direction of Soldau and were temporarily subordinated to this army. The Supreme Army Command was fully in agreement with this intention of further encirclement. The advance was expected to be determined, \"that the decisions made are to be executed immediately\" \u2014 but in the following days, the restrictive provision was made for the use of the Guard Corps that it should not be led beyond Ziechano\u0301w for the time being. The corps of the 2nd Army moved partly in very arduous marches westward into their new assembly areas, which they had to reach by August 18. By then, the I Corps at Ziechano\u0301w and the Guard Corps behind it at Nowogeorgiewsk were to be ready. On the left flank, the 1st Rifle Brigade, as well as newly arrived forces (5th and Caucasian Cavalry Division and a Turkestan Cossack Brigade) covered the area west of Nowogeorgiewsk to Plozk and Lodz.\nAlso, in the 1st Army, movements against the German border had been in full swing everywhere since August 14. On this day, the 1st Cavalry Division, along with parts of the 5th Rifle Brigade \u2014 perhaps only to fulfill the promise made to France, at least in form \u2014 made their advance for violent reconnaissance on Marggrabowa.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>hatte die 1.

In Gumbinnen, only the heavy artillery was stationed, in Insterburg only the General Command. In front of the divisions, between Kowahlen (southeast of Goldap) and Bilderweitschen (northwest of Wirballen), individual battalions with cavalry and artillery were drawn close to the border. General v. Fran\u00e7ois remained in this position even after the army order of August 14 made the intentions of the Army High Command for further operations known to him.\nOn the other hand, the Army High Command had learned through the clashes with the enemy on August 14 north of Marggrabowa and later at Bilderweitschen that, contrary to the explicit instructions of the Commander-in-Chief, individual closed units of the I Corps were stationed east of the Goldap\u2014Gumbinnen line. Generaloberst v. Prittwitz had refrained from intervening because of this. However, General v. Fran\u00e7ois had been able to conceal from the Army High Command that the entire corps was far outside the assigned area. He himself was seldom in Insterburg, instead seeking out his forward troops and making his arrangements on site personally. His confident and fresh manner also inspired the troops with initiative and confidence in victory. However, his chief of staff, whom he left behind in Insterburg, was thus sidelined; he often did not learn or only learned late what the commanding general had ordered at the front.\nThe apparent inactivity of the enemy and the unclear situation in front of the corps' front prompted General v. Fran\u00e7ois to set up his own forceful reconnaissance for August 15. On this day, the commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade, Major General v. Strotka, with four battalions and a field artillery regiment, advanced over the border at Riddtayn. At the same time, a heavy field howitzer battery was supposed to target the local water tower, as it provided the Russians with a wide overview. The enemy advance troops evaded the attack, the targeting of the tower was unsuccessful, and in the evening the German troops were withdrawn again.

General v. Fran\u00e7ois, however, did not want to forgo a strike against the enemy cavalry, which had meanwhile also been detected at Schillehnen. There were no indications that a general Russian attack was imminent. The aerial reconnaissance, as already mentioned^1), had yielded no results on August 15 and 16. Thus, General v. Fran\u00e7ois had once again ordered an operation by the 1st Cavalry Division for August 17. For this, the 2nd Landwehr Brigade from Tilsit had sent two companies by ship up the Njemen to Jurburg to get behind the Russian cavalry. They arrived there early on the 17th without having seen the enemy. At the same time, the 1st Infantry Division was also supposed to attempt to block the Russians' retreat by advancing from the south.\nOn August 16, General v. Fran\u00e7ois had announced himself for the following morning at the 1st Infantry Division. At 10:30 PM, a report came in from this division stating that in the evening, Russian infantry with artillery had advanced from Wirballen to the southwest over the border and had set up outposts from northeast of Pillkallen to the western exit of Eydtkuhnen. A Russian battalion probing towards Bilderweitschen had been repelled there. \u2014 This report suggested the possibility of further local skirmishes at Stallup\u00f6nen, but since everything was calm on the rest of the front, there was no reason to change the measures taken for August 17. Even with the initially affected 1st Infantry Division, the Russian advance was not considered significant. Thus, the corps remained with its two infantry divisions as before in the 60 km wide formation from Kowahlen to Bilderweitschen. The rear parts (\"corps reserve\") of the 1st Division, stationed 20 km deep, began the exercises scheduled for August 17 in the morning, and the staff of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade conducted a tactical exercise march.\nMeanwhile, the Russians had begun their advance early on August 17 across the entire front from Suwalki to Schillehnen.\n</body>\n<footer>1) p. 62.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "078": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Hinter dieser Sicherung vorbei marschierte er selbst mit allem, was er zur Hand hatte (4 Bataillone, 1 Schwadron, 5 Batterien), der 1.

The Russians advanced in greater breadth against the outposts of the 1st Infantry Division, positioned from Dopp\u00f6nen (8 km south of Stallup\u00f6nen) to Bilderweitschen. The division commander, Lieutenant General v. Conta, had alerted the resting units. South of the railway, the 2nd Infantry Brigade under Colonel Paschen was to advance, and north, the 1st under Major General v. Trotha.\nThe enemy brought increasingly stronger forces into battle by noon and threatened to envelop both flanks of the division. Against the right, they advanced over Dopp\u00f6nen and southward towards the west. The 2nd Infantry Brigade, however, had only two battalions of the Grenadier Regiment King Friedrich Wilhelm I No. 3 to deploy. Together with the 1st Division of the Field Artillery Regiment 52, they initially halted the enemy's envelopment movement south of G\u00f6rritten by noon. The left flank of the brigade had to be extended by parts of the 1st Brigade. On both sides of the railway, however, there was still a gap about 5 km wide in the front of the 1st Infantry Division towards Bilderweitschen, which the enemy did not penetrate. Parts of the 1st Brigade held the advanced outpost positions at Bilderweitschen. From there, the line bent back westward towards Degesen. The enemy advanced against this front over Caruppen\u00f6n and westward for envelopment. Despite the difficult situation, Lieutenant General v. Conta was determined to fight through.\nMeanwhile, parts of the 2nd Infantry Division were advancing from the south. The division commander, Lieutenant General v. Falk, had expected the advance of enemy forces with the 4th Infantry Brigade at Tollmingkehmen against the 5th Infantry Brigade stationed at Golsdap. He had received reports of the enemy's advance from Wischtynjez to Tollmingkehmen. However, as he simultaneously heard the continuously increasing battle noise in the north, he independently and responsibly decided to leave only weak forces south of Tollmingkehmen.

Fran\u00e7ois: Generaloberst v. Prittwitz had learned about the munitions requirements for the heavy artillery of the I Army Corps from the operation on August 15 against Kibarty\u2014Wirballen and realized that General v. Fran\u00e7ois had not only moved with advance troops but with a large part of his corps, contrary to the explicit orders of the army, leaving the assigned assembly area. To gain clarity, the commander-in-chief called the I Army Corps command in Insterburg early on August 17 and requested information about the deployment of the divisions. Only then did it become clear to him that the entire corps was close to the border. It was thus alone 40 km in front of the not yet fully assembled other corps. This called into question the previous operational plan of the army high command. If a battle occurred with the I Army Corps now, it would not be possible to assist it in time. Generaloberst v. Prittwitz therefore ordered the corps to immediately withdraw to the area of Gumbinnen and not to engage in any battle. If a battle was already underway, it should be broken off. With this order, the first general staff officer of the corps, Major v. Massow, sought out the commanding general. He found him around 2 p.m. with the staff of the 1st Infantry Division at the southern edge of Stallup\u00f6nen. General v. Fran\u00e7ois, who expected the intervention of his 2nd Infantry Division and thus victory in the next few hours, dismissed him under these circumstances. Major v. Massow reported to the army high command that General v. Fran\u00e7ois was currently unable to execute the order, as the entire 1st Infantry Division was already engaged in battle. This was the first news the army high command received about the battle.\nGeneral v. Fran\u00e7ois had meanwhile moved to the southern flank to the advancing troops of the 2nd Infantry Division, from whom he expected the decision of the day. When he arrived there, victory had been achieved: Even before the intervention of the 2nd Infantry Division, the 5th Grenadiers under Oberstlt. Wedel had advanced to the attack. The right wing of the 43rd Infantry Regiment had closed ranks. The enemy, simultaneously threatened by the advance from the south, retreated but could no longer escape the blow of the 4th Infantry Brigade led by Generalleutnant v. Falk under Generalmajor Bo\u00ebs. This blow completely collapsed the Russian southern flank. The German infantry continued the attack until darkness and reached the line Pitschlauen\u2014Stallullen. Thus, the enemy was thrown south of the railway in the evening, with the Russian 27th Infantry Division (from the III Corps) retreating over the border with heavy losses.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>abends s\u00fcdlich der Eisenbahn geworfen, die russische 27.

They left several thousand prisoners in the hands of the victors.\nOn the northern wing of the 1st Infantry Division, the battle was less successful: On both sides of Bilderweitschen, the front gradually gave way to the strong Russian pressure. At Bilderweitschen itself, the commander of the III Battalion of the Infantry Regiment v. Boyen No. 41, Major Schmidt, with two companies and two batteries from the 1st East Prussian Field Artillery Regiment No. 16, held out against all Russian assaults until nightfall. Then he too had to retreat, leaving behind seven guns. The heroic resistance of the small group, however, gave the other troops the opportunity to reorganize northeast of Stallup\u00f6nen. The enemy did not press further here.\nFurther north, the 1st Cavalry Division, missing an entire regiment\u00b9) besides the dispatched reconnaissance squadrons, had to evade the overwhelming enemy force. The enemy seemed to be encircling on both sides of the Schorellenser Forest. The division commander, Lieutenant General Brecht, now saw his task as protecting the left flank of the 1st Army Corps and initially retreated to Streittalungen. In the afternoon, he left only security forces here; the division itself moved behind the wing of the 1st Infantry Division to Kattenau, where horse and rider found the rest they had lacked since the beginning of the war in the facilities of the remount depot. However, the enemy continued to expand westward on the northern wing. Russians (10 km west of Pillkallen) were reported to have occupied it in the evening.\nGeneral v. Fran\u00e7ois immediately returned to the 1st Infantry Division after the victory on the right wing. He was impressed by the first major success achieved in the south. Here the enemy was defeated, their own losses were low, and the 3rd Infantry Brigade had not yet entered the battle. The commanding general and the commander of the 1st Infantry Division were convinced that it would be possible to turn the situation to their advantage on the northern wing the following day. Meanwhile, however, a new order from the army high command had arrived, stating that the battle should be broken off \u2014 \"even if successful in arms.\" With a heavy heart, General v.

It was inevitable that he felt like the victor.\nThe I Army Corps had stood against three Russian infantry divisions on August 17 at Stallup\u00f6nen with not quite three infantry brigades, as we know today: the 27th and 25th from the III and the 29th from the XX Corps. Of these, the southernmost, the 27th Infantry Division, was defeated at G\u00f6rritten; their regiments suffered particularly heavily from the pursuing fire of the German artillery when crossing the border river and lost a total of 6600 men\u00b9). This Russian division was hardly in question for the continuation of the battle on August 18. The 25th Infantry Division, fighting on both sides of the main road, had advanced to 4 km east of Stallup\u00f6nen, its right wing had taken Bilderweitschen from the east. The 29th Infantry Division, also fighting, had reached Bilderweitschen with its left wing and Degesen with its right. These two Russian divisions were themselves in the full feeling of their first victory and were fully operational for August 18\u00b9).\nHowever, the Russians had also advanced east and north of the battlefield simultaneously without the German I Army Corps being aware. In the south, the Russian 1st Cavalry Division had reached the area of Marggrabowa, the 5th Rifle Brigade had come to Kowahlen. From the IV Corps, the 30th Infantry Division had been held up by the advance troops of the German 3rd Infantry Brigade stationed at Goldap; it reached Dubeningken in the evening. The Russian 40th Infantry Division, with its 1st Brigade, had engaged in combat against detachments of the German 4th Infantry Brigade left behind at Medlkehmen in the morning. While these withdrew to Tollmingkehmen, the Russians, following the order of their army command and the troops of the German General v. Falk, marched north to support the III Corps in the afternoon. Thus, the Russian 40th Division with the 1st Brigade reached Wischwillen in the evening, while on the southern flank of the German I Army Corps.

He also had the troops of the neighboring corps involved in the battle at his disposal. According to his order issued the evening before at 9 o'clock, the attack was to begin on August 18 at 4 o'clock in the morning: the 40th, 27th, and 25th Infantry Divisions from the east against the line Kasluben (14 km south of Stallup\u00f6nen)\u2014Wischnawetschen\u2014G\u00f6rritten\u2014Stallup\u00f6nen, further from the north with the left wing on the road Degenen\u2014Stallup\u00f6nen the 29th Infantry Division, reinforced by a brigade of the 28th Infantry Division. \u2014 One cannot help but feel that such an attack, with partly very fresh forces, would have put the German I Army Corps in a rather difficult position, even if it was expected that the Russian 27th Infantry Division would not participate in the attack.\nEven during the night, advance troops of the Russian 25th Infantry Division moved towards Stallup\u00f6nen. They found no enemy anymore. When General v. Rennenkampf arrived in Wirballen early on August 18, he received reports of the German withdrawal. General v.

From here, he continued the march on Gumbinnen on August 18. Despite the retreat, he felt victorious against an enemy superior in numbers; the same feeling inspired the bulk of his troops.

It reported to the Supreme Army Command in the evening, estimating the enemy advancing from the Augustowo\u2014Wirballen front to be 4 to 5 corps.\nThe assembly of the 8th Army was largely carried out as ordered by Generaloberst v. Prittwitz on the morning of August 14, but parts of the XVII Army Corps were still missing, which were not expected to arrive until the evening of August 18. The I Army Corps could only be at Gumbinnen by the morning of that day. It was then approximately in the area assigned to it at the time. However, the assumptions that led Generaloberst v. Prittwitz to order the assembly of the army behind the Angerapp on August 14 no longer applied. At that time, it was assumed that the enemy's northern flank only reached the Rominterheide and that the enemy had crossed the border in full advance on August 14. Based on this, the intention was to encircle the Russian northern flank from the area of Gumbinnen\u2014Insterburg. Now, this enemy flank extended even to the Kowno railway \u2014 as learned on August 18, even further north, beyond Schirwindt \u2014 and the enemy had only begun the advance across the border on August 17, three days later than assumed. Due to the autonomy of the I Army Corps, this advance was now further delayed. Thus, the situation had developed spatially and temporally quite differently than the Army High Command had assumed on August 14. It had become questionable whether the encirclement of the Russian northern flank could succeed and whether there would be enough time to bring about the decision against the Njemen Army before the advance of the Narew Army made it impossible.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>sie unm\u00f6glich machte.</fragment_2>", "084": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Vor ihm war\".

Its decisions, as far as known so far, were initially not influenced. \nIn the thought that the enemy might immediately pursue the I Army Corps, \nGeneraloberst v. Prittwitz had ordered the other corps on the evening of August 17 \nto be ready to attack as soon as the XVII Army Corps was fully assembled. When \nthe enemy did not initially follow, this idea was set aside again. \nThey wanted to let the Russians continue to approach the Angerap. \nHowever, Generaloberst v. Prittwitz kept the I Army Corps \nat Gumbinnen and northwards. The 1st Cavalry Division and \nthe 2nd Landwehr Brigade, positioned behind the Inster at Kraupischken \nand northwards, remained under General v. Fran\u00e7ois. His \ntroops were thus 10 km ahead of the rest of the front. The intentions \nbehind this deployment are not known. It almost seems \nas if they did not want to order General v. Fran\u00e7ois to retreat again. Presumably, he sought to direct the operations \ninto the paths he deemed correct. \nHe continued to anticipate the Russians' intention to envelop his northern \nflank. To have a powerful force at hand against this, \nhe wanted to move his southern, 2nd Infantry Division behind the left \nflank. The High Command agreed with this intention \nand provided him on the evening of August 18 with the main reserve from K\u00f6nigsberg, stationed south of Insterburg, for his right flank as reinforcement. \nThe information available to the Army High Command until then \nsuggested that the advance of the Russian Narew Army was also nearing its end. They simultaneously indicated \nan extension of the western flank of this army through troop concentration \nin the area previously reported free by the enemy around and west \nof Warsaw: By August 15, all Germans and \nAustrians were to have been expelled from Lodz, as troops were expected. \nThere was active military traffic around Warsaw, troops were arriving. \nParts of the Russian I Corps were reported to have marched from the area west of the city \ntowards Nowogeorgiewsk. Further east, the Russians \nhad already begun their advance on the Narew line. Airmen had \ndetermined that on the morning of August 18, at least one Russian division \nhad advanced about 15 km from Ostrolenka to the west and another from Lomsha to the northwest \nand then had gone to rest.

The situation is now particularly favorable. However, the commander-in-chief wanted to have a clearer view of the enemy south of the Rominten Heath. At 4:30 in the afternoon, the General Command of the I Army Corps reported to the Army High Command, which had meanwhile been moved forward to Ordenburg, once again about the situation and intentions. It indicated that the Russians might attack during the night.\nAt this time \u2014 on the afternoon of August 19th \u2014 the Army High Command had the following picture of the situation in front of the rest of the front:\nThe deployment of the army around Lomsha continued towards the East Prussian southern border. From Ostrolenka and Lomsha, the forward parts seemed to be advancing further in the general direction of Ortelsburg. However, an immediate threat did not yet seem to exist here. Nevertheless, it was questionable whether one could wait much longer at the Angerap. \u2014 The Russian II Corps had reached the area of Lyck. \u2014 No enemy had been identified at Marggrabowa and in the Rominten Heath, but the flyers had reported 1\u00bd to 2 infantry divisions in the area south and east of Goldap, which seemed to be turning over Goldap towards Darkehmen, with strong cavalry at Wischtitenzylze. This gave the impression that there was a strong group at Gumbinnen, separate from the rest of the army, while other forces south of the heath were even further back. In this situation, the reports from the I Army Corps were decisive. The corps could not be left alone against the enemy again.\nThus, Generaloberst v. Prittwitz decided to advance with the remaining corps. This decision, which corresponded to the suggestion of General v. Fran\u00e7ois, as is now established, was all the more appropriate to the situation, as the Russians would not have appeared at the Angerap on August 20th either, but at the earliest on the 21st. They took their time and were cautious. If the German 8th Army had remained standing longer, inexplicable days would have been lost, and eventually, the advance of the Russian Narew Army would probably have forced them to retreat before they could engage. \u2014 Generaloberst v. Prittwitz now wanted to first attack the Gumbinnen group of Russians, while securing himself against the enemy expected from Goldap through strong right-wing positioning. Only after the Gumbinnen group was defeated did he want to turn against the Goldap enemy.\nTo this end, the Army High Command ordered the XVII Army Corps at 4:30 in the afternoon to immediately advance in two columns against the line Walterkehmen\u2014Perkallen\u2014Plicken.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>die Linie Walterkehmen\u2014Perkallen\u2014Plicken anzutreten.</fragment_2>", "087": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die 29.

The XVII Army Corps appeared strong enough to bring the decision here. All other forces were therefore detached to protect the flank of this Army Corps: The I Reserve Corps was to cover against the Goldap enemy, whose beginning was already assumed in the afternoon at Kleszowen. The 3rd Reserve Division was initially to advance only to Rutten (20 km northeast of L\u00f6tzen).

From the XX Corps, the 28th Infantry Division advanced only a short distance west and southwest until it came into contact with the troops of the 1st German Infantry Division.

Rennenkampf ordered his army, considering the fatigue of the troops and the regulation of supplies, to advance only as far as possible without serious combat. \u2014 The decision on the place and time of the battle no longer depended on the Russian commander-in-chief.

The small detachment encountered the Russian cavalry corps near Rauschen. A battle ensued. As the brigade lacked any ammunition columns, a shortage of ammunition occurred in the afternoon. Despite all bravery, the detachment had to retreat behind the Inster under significant losses (II Battalion Landwehr Regiment 4 alone lost 13 officers, 219 men). Meanwhile, sent for assistance by General v. Fran\u00e7ois, the German 1st Cavalry Division approached through the Schwalder Forest. They took the enemy by surprise with their artillery in the evening, so effectively that he left 7 guns and otherwise disappeared into the darkness. The Landwehr Brigade could no longer benefit from this.

The bivouac fires burned throughout the night, while the division itself marched over difficult field and forest paths for over 15 km through the moonless night. It reached its deployment areas in the morning fog. The difficult movement had been smoothly executed. At 4 a.m., the East Prussians launched their attack. The Russians were completely surprised. The Fusilier Regiment Graf Roon (East Prussian) No. 33 took Mallwischken in the first assault. The Eymenis River was forded. Behind this section, on the glacis-like ascending heights of Gerteheim, the Russians offered desperate resistance. The attackers had to wait for the artillery's effect. Thus, a brief halt occurred. But by 9 a.m., the infantry stormed the Russian position from the west and north. The commander of the East Prussian Fusilier Regiment, Colonel v. Fumetti, fell. The attack continued on Mingstimmen.\nThe 1st Infantry Division had already begun its artillery fire at 3:30 a.m. before the 2nd Infantry Division's attack to divert the enemy's attention from the encirclement. The Russians responded, but their fire soon subsided, and they seemed to be withdrawing forces under the pressure of the 2nd Infantry Division's attack. Lieutenant General v. Conta decided, therefore, to also go on the offensive at 5:30 a.m. He intended to lead it straight from his position in the general direction of the Russians. However, this direction did not correspond to the overall situation; the general command intervened and directed the course towards Rattenau. The division, which had previously faced north and was heavily echeloned to the left, complied with the order by pivoting the entire division front. However, hours passed before this already difficult movement was executed in continuous combat against the strongly resisting enemy; particularly fierce battles developed around the localities. After thorough artillery preparation, Bratup\u00f6nen fell at 11 a.m. However, the right wing had not yet advanced at this time; it was still at Springen.\nFollowing the 1st Infantry Division, the main reserve K\u00f6nigsberg under Lieutenant General Brodr\u00fcck was in their previous positions, which had been under enemy artillery fire since early morning.\nGeneral v.

He decided on an overtaking pursuit on the large road to Pillkallen, covered with stragglers and vehicles. Thus, the division was out of the fight for the 2nd Infantry Division west of Kattenau. It might have brought the decision there. So, Lieutenant General Brecht reached Pillkallen at 3 p.m., 12 km behind the Russian front, without encountering significant resistance. Here he turned south with the 2nd and 41st Cavalry Brigades and encountered a Russian unit consisting of infantry with machine guns and artillery at Schilleningken, which was retreating eastward. He had them fired upon and launched an attack with the 2nd Cavalry Brigade (12th Uhlans and 9th J\u00e4ger 3rd Pf.) supported by parts of the 41st Cavalry Brigade. The Russians fled. The commander of the Russian Infantry Regiment 111, 2 closed infantry companies, and the flag of Regiment 110, all from the 28th Infantry Division, fell into the hands of the German riders, while other parts escaped south. The battle noise at the I Army Corps had meanwhile subsided. It was not possible to establish a connection there.

It was now assumed, in accordance with the information received from the Army High Command, that the enemy's southern wing was advancing against the I Army Corps, thus towards the northwest, and that they would therefore strike it in the flank.

The 35th Infantry Division was to advance with its right wing from Perballen to Jodszuhnen (east of Augstup\u00f6nen), the 36th to support this attack via Walterkehmen and push south.

The General Command was\nreported at 7:30 in the morning that it had succeeded in preventing the enemy from continuing\ntheir withdrawal. \u2014 The division could not know\nthat it now faced strong forces from the Russian 27th and 40th Infantry\nDivisions, which had been alerted early in the morning and were now ready for defense from north of\nMattischkehmen to south of Sobehnen.\nGeneral v.

Up to the pivot point, the attack of the\nGerman troops had advanced smoothly over flat and clear terrain. Now the ridge east of the stream\nlimited the view. But behind it began a hilly and very unclear\nterrain with numerous individual farms. What was happening there remained hidden from the\nattacker. \u2014 General v. Mackensen had meanwhile received information\nfrom General v. Fran\u00e7ois about the retreat\nof the enemy in front of the front of the I Army Corps and the call\nto advance on Zirgupl\u00f6nen. This reinforced the impression at the\nGeneral Command, already formed by received reports and previous\nown observations, that the enemy was in full\nretreat and only offered resistance at pivot points behind the pivot point. The reports from the flyers did not contradict this\nview. They had seen nothing of the enemy from the railway east of Gum-\nbinnen to the Rominten Heath except for wagon columns and abandoned\nbivouac sites at 6:00 in the morning.

Further north, the troops of the 36th Infantry Division gradually gained the impression that they were facing a strong enemy in a prepared position. The attack on the places on the heights east of Schwentischke barely advanced despite the deployment of the last reserves.\nNorth of the 36th Infantry Division, Lieutenant General Hennig had led his 70th Infantry Brigade against Mattischkehmen. Here too, they encountered stubborn resistance.\nIn the early afternoon hours, the corps' attack along the entire front came to a halt. Believing they were pursuing a retreating enemy, the troops were often surprised and partially severely shaken by the sudden onset of mass fire from the mostly invisible defender. To assist the rapidly advancing infantry, some batteries had moved openly into this critical position and now suffered heavily themselves. Parts of the rifle lines that had broken into the Russian lines in the first assault were unable to hold their ground there. Thus, the infantry remained at effective rifle range in the open field in front of the enemy position. They had been on the move for almost 24 hours, their ammunition was running low, and they suffered heavily under the fire of the entrenched Russian infantry as well as from machine guns and more distant batteries. It was not possible to locate and combat this artillery in the confusing terrain behind the Russian position. Thus, the losses increased; the loss of numerous officers and non-commissioned officers was particularly noticeable. \u2014 Then, probably first east of Gr\u00fcnweitschen, retrograde movements began around 3 p.m. They were soon brought to a halt by the leaders rushing forward. General v. Mackensen had now gradually gained the impression that he was facing a strong enemy and that his corps alone would no longer be able to carry out the attack. Since no help was in sight from the I Reserve Corps and I Army Corps for the time being, he ordered the line gained to be held and fortified.\nSoon further setbacks occurred: The earlier, in a different situation, ordered withdrawal of batteries to the new corps reserve weakened the artillery firepower of the 35th Infantry Division. The rifle lines, largely deprived of their officers, had hardly been able to hold under enemy fire anyway. Now they began to retreat downwards from Gr\u00fcnweitschen. This movement spread mainly northward, where the attack of the 87th Infantry Brigade against rifle groups had already begun to falter.</body>\n<fragment_2>Brigade gegen Sch\u00fctzengruppen ohnehin schon ins Wanken gekommen war.</fragment_2>\n</english_page_1_new>", "096": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Dann trat das Korps den Nachtmarsch gegen den Feind an, mit der 1.

He ordered the shaken troops of the XVII Army Corps, especially in the dark, to only be positioned behind a strong obstacle. The 87th Infantry Brigade had already continued its retreat behind the Romintre. Thus, General v. Mackensen ordered at 5 p.m. that the other parts of the corps also retreat behind this river course, which was then to be held.\nHowever, the Russians did not exploit their success. They did not press forward anywhere. As soon as General v. Mackensen realized this, he attempted again to stop the retreat. This was only successful with the 36th Infantry Division, whose right wing and center remained in the positions gained at noon, while Lieutenant General v. Heineccius had moved his left wing to the heights north of Walterkehmen. The 35th Infantry Division gathered at Perkallen behind the Romintre.\nA chain of unfortunate circumstances had led to well-trained troops, who later proved themselves everywhere, losing their footing at the first encounter with the enemy.

Lieutenant General v. Below wanted to fulfill his mission to cover the flank of the XVII Army Corps by attacking the enemy assumed to be marching from Goldap to the north. During the advance, the situation changed: The report that the enemy had already reached Kleszowen proved false. He had only reached Goldap. Under these circumstances, the commander-in-chief instructed the I Reserve Corps during the night not to attack this enemy alone, but to wait until further forces in the north, at Gumbinnen, were free. The decision there was initially the most important.\nAfter a night march on difficult country roads, which was no less strenuous than that of the active XVII Army Corps, and delayed by incoming refugee groups, the I Reserve Corps reached Kleszowen on August 20 around 8 a.m. with the 1st Reserve Division. It was to defend here against the Goldap enemy, with the 36th Reserve Division to the north at Friedrichsberg\u2014K\u00f6nigsfelde. From the northeast, sounds echoed over; but from the direction of Goldap, there were no new reports. Since the corps had no aircraft assigned, they relied on their cavalry (6 reserve squadrons) for reconnaissance. However, Lieutenant General v. Below knew the 3rd Reserve Division was marching from Kutten to Bentheim to the right rear of his corps. Therefore, he had no hesitation in ordering his divisions to continue marching northeast at 7:30 a.m. to engage in the battle of the XVII Army Corps or to confront the Goldap enemy if he marched over Gawaiten or even further east to the north.\nThe army command was not in agreement with this intention of the I Reserve Corps. It had consistently received favorable reports in the morning about the state of the battle at Gumbinnen and did not consider the intervention of the I Reserve Corps necessary there. However, the command had received reports from its own aircraft that about two enemy corps were holding at Goldap and to the south. It therefore ordered the I Reserve Corps to remain at Kleszowen and K\u00f6nigsfelde. Consequently, Lieutenant General v. Below halted his corps at 10:30 a.m. The 1st Reserve Division had just reached Gawaiten with the vanguard, the 36th K\u00f6nigsfelde. The 3rd Reserve Division had also been held by the army command at Bentheim. There was no direct connection between it and the I Reserve Corps. In such a situation, the I Reserve Corps was completely surprised by an attack from the south: The Russian 30th Infantry Division of the IV Corps had set out early on August 20 in two columns from Goldap to Kleistowen and Gawaiten.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Die russische 30.

The division commander, Lieutenant General v. F\u00f6rster, who was located west of Gawaiten, could only instruct the vanguard to hold this place. At the same time, the other troops of his division independently engaged in battle at Kleistowen, where they were. They immediately halted the Russian advance, then took the initiative to attack and gradually pushed the enemy back several kilometers throughout the day. Lieutenant General v. F\u00f6rster was wounded but was able to retain command of his division.\nMeanwhile, Major General Kruse had immediately deployed his 36th Reserve Division to Gawaiten. Here too, the Russians, who received reinforcements at noon from the Rominten Heath through the regiment of their 40th Infantry Division that had been diverted there, were pushed back in fierce fighting. By evening, the 1st Reserve Corps, after temporary setbacks, stood in two completely separate groups on the contested ground south of Kleistowen and east of Gawaiten. A unified command by the general staff was hardly possible. The leadership and troops of the Reserve Corps had proven themselves in this first battle in difficult circumstances through independent action and distinguished themselves. The corps felt victorious.\nOnly three hours from the battlefield, the 3rd Reserve Division had been stationed at Bentheim since 10 a.m. The army high command only released this last reserve when Lieutenant General v. Below reported in the afternoon that his entire corps was engaged in battle against a strong enemy. At 4 p.m., Generaloberst v. Prittwitz personally gave the division commander Lieutenant General 1) v. Morgen the order by telephone to advance into the rear of the Russians fighting at Kleistowen. However, he added a cautionary note: \"It is important to me that the division emerges from this battle as unscathed as possible, to have it available for other tasks.\" General v. Morgen immediately set out; it became dark before he reached the enemy. Thus, the division, ready to strike the enemy flank, with the right wing near the Goldap River, south of Kleistowen, settled down to rest, planning to break through unexpectedly at dawn.</body>\n<footer>1) Meanwhile promoted.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "099": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Daher erwog Generaloberst v.

The Decision to Retreat.</header>\n<body>\nThe Army High Command had been in communication with the general commands all day and was continuously informed about the state of the battle. The successes of the I Army Corps and the rapid advance of the XVII Army Corps had created a confident mood of victory during the morning. It was dampened when it was learned that the attack of the I Army Corps had come to a halt, and when the first reports of setbacks at the XVII Army Corps arrived.\nIn the afternoon hours of August 20, the High Command had the following picture of the situation:\nOn the northern flank, the 2nd Landwehr Brigade had been withdrawn westward from the infantry. There was no news from the 1st Cavalry Division since it had set out in pursuit in the morning. Presumably, the more than threefold superior Russian cavalry dominated the situation in the north of both armies. Reinforcements could reach the Russian northern flank at any time by rail. Thus, despite the successes of the German 2nd Infantry Division, it seemed by no means certain that continuing the attack on this flank the following day would achieve a decision. In the center, one could no longer expect much from a new attack by the main reserve K\u00f6nigsberg and the XVII Army Corps. A victory seemed hardly to be hoped for on this day. When it was fully learned that the corps was retreating behind the Romintze, and the intelligence officers described the condition of the retreating troops in gloomy terms, doubts also arose with the commander-in-chief and his chief of staff as to whether it would be possible to continue the attack the next day with a prospect of success. It seemed that one had to be satisfied if the center held its positions. The I Reserve Corps and the 3rd Reserve Division on the southern flank also faced an opponent presumably of equal strength. It was expected that further Russian forces were on the march here. But even if the flank attack of the 3rd Reserve Division on the morning of August 21 on the southern flank brought full success, it could hardly have any impact on the Gumbinnen battlefront on the same day. Thus, a quick and decisive success against the Nejemen Army seemed not impossible, but by no means likely or even certain. Therefore, Generaloberst v. Prittwitz considered at 5 p.m. whether it would be necessary to break off the battle and retreat.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>5\u00b0 nachmittags, ob es nicht n\u00f6tig sein werde, die Schlacht abzubrechen und zur\u00fcckzugehen.</fragment_2>", "100": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Beide waren daher sofort entschlossen, den Kampf bei Gumbinnen, an dessen erfolgreichem Ausgang sie ohnehin zweifelten, abzubrechen und die Armee nach Westen zur\u00fcck-\".

Corps and the 15th Cavalry Division belonged to the Narew Army. The forces previously observed at Lomsha and Ostrolenka had continued their advance on August 19 and 20 and reached the border from Friedrichshof to Chorzele. However, new enemy forces were also detected far east at Prasznysz. When Generaloberst v. Prittwitz personally inquired by telephone with the Chief of Staff of the XX Army Corps at 8 p.m., the Chief of Staff of the Corps, Colonel Hell, reported that the enemy was estimated to be 2 to 2\u00bd Russian corps and 2 rifle brigades. The XX Army Corps did not expect any support. The main thing was to show at Gumbinnen, \"here we will hold.\" To this end, the commanding General v. Scholtz wanted to shift his forces to Neidenburg to attack the Russian western flank. But at 7 p.m., the command received another message from Major General v. Unger, the leader of the fortress troops at Soldau: Flyers had recognized the advance of long columns on the Warsaw\u2014Pultusk\u2014Ziechanow road up to 10 km south of Mlawa at noon, as well as troops at Nasielsk. Here at least one more corps was advancing.\nThese reports overturned all previous calculations of the army command: The entire Narew Army now seemed to be in full advance, extending much further west than previously assumed. The German XX Army Corps and the fortress troops alone were not able to stop eight Russian divisions (including two rifle brigades). The condition already required in the report to the Supreme Army Command on August 9 for the attack against the Njemen Army, that a threat from the Prasznysz\u2014Ostrolenka line must be excluded, was no longer fulfilled. The positioning of the army on the Vistula was in question. One could be pushed back to K\u00f6nigsberg. Generaloberst v. Prittwitz and Major General Count v. Waldersee recalled the warning that Generaloberst v. Moltke had given them precisely in this regard. Both were therefore immediately determined to break off the battle at Gumbinnen, whose successful outcome they already doubted, and to execute the retreat of the army to the west.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>ausf\u00fchren.</fragment_2>", "101": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"da\u00df ein anderer, vielleicht k\u00fchnerer Entschlu\u00df, der\".

The Quartermaster General, Major General Gr\u00fcnert, and the \nfirst General Staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann, had foreseen this \ndecision. They believed that the battle of Gumbinnen on August 21 \ncould definitely be won and therefore had to be fought through; they \npointed out that when retreating, one would no longer pass the Narew \nArmy without a fight, as it had the much shorter route to the Vistula. \nOne would be in a very different position if the Njemen Army had been \ndefeated beforehand and thereby had freedom of movement.\nColonel General v. Prittwitz rejected these objections and \nremained in agreement with his Chief of Staff on the decision to retreat. \nHe was further strengthened in his view by a somewhat later incoming \naviation report about numerous enemy troops at Stallup\u00f6nen and the \nmarch of a column from Schw\u00f6llmen to Pillkallen1). They were seen as \nreinforcements for the Russian northern flank. It could have been the \nRussian Guard Corps, which was expected in this area according to \nagent reports.\nRegarding the decision to retreat by Colonel General v. Prittwitz, it \nshould be noted: The German 8th Army had just now achieved what \nmust have been the highest goal of any operation of the German \nminority, it had engaged the Russian armies in unison for battle. Would \na similarly favorable opportunity ever present itself again? \u2014 The goal \nof the commander had to be victory over the Njemen Army. If he \nachieved that, all other difficulties would be easier to resolve. Whether \nthe Narew Army would then advance further? If it did, its retreat was \nas threatened as that of the German 8th Army. However, the latter had \nthe moral superiority of the victor on its side.\nIf Colonel General v. Prittwitz had believed in a victory for August \n21, then he would probably have continued to fight, despite the threat \nfrom the Narew Army.

It remained about 9 km east of Kraupischken (quiet)\u00b2) all day. The 1st independent cavalry brigade had already retreated to the border. The numerical superiority of the Russian cavalry on the northern flank was no longer significant under these circumstances. However, the German 1st Cavalry Division stood victorious at Pillkallen. \u2014 From the Russian XX Corps, the northern 28th Infantry Division was in full dissolution. Its entire artillery, except for one battery that fell into German hands after being shot up, and three infantry regiments with their commanders had fled to Wirballen. The losses amounted to over 7000 men. Not much could have been left of this division\u00b3). Thus, the German 2nd Infantry Division would have had an easy time if it had continued the attack on the afternoon of August 20 or resumed it on the morning of August 21. \u2014 Reserves behind the Russian front were missing, the foremost reserve division advanced without waiting for its last infantry regiment, only on August 21 from Wirballen.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>fanterie-Regiment abgewartet zu haben, erst am 21.

Nothing could have prevented the German left wing from rolling up the Russian line of battle from the north on that day.\nThe Russian center (29th Infantry Division from the XX Corps and III Corps) had also suffered heavily; the 27th Infantry Division had already lost 6600 men since the battle of Stallup\u00f6nen. The commander of the 40th Infantry Division from the IV Corps, which was adjacent to the south, reported \"the continuously increasing flight of soldiers (Jews and a few Russians), who are completely healthy and lively.\" The Russian center might have been able to hold against a new German frontal attack on August 21 until it fell victim to the encirclement from the north; it could not attack itself.\nOn the southern flank, a complete German success was assured for August 21. The enemy had deployed almost all forces against the I Reserve Corps. Of them, the 119th Infantry Regiment had already turned to flight, and the others could only be held with difficulty by their officers. The Russian 1st Cavalry Division was more than 10 km south of Goldap and remained there on August 21. Thus, the attack of the German 3rd Reserve Division at dawn would have caught the enemy in flank and rear and probably led to the capture of a large part of the 3/4 Russian divisions fighting here in the angle between Goldaper Lake and Goldap River.\nThat General v. Rennenkampf correctly recognized the danger threatening his army on the evening of August 20 is highly unlikely. As far as we know, he did not want to give up the battle, \"contrary to the advice of his entire staff to retreat to avoid an overwhelming defeat\"\u00b9). Fortune of war spared him from such a fate on August 21: On the night before this day, the German 8th Army began the retreat along the entire front.\nIt had not been easy to make it clear to the German troops on the victorious wings of the army that they should now retreat despite the successes achieved. General v. Fran\u00e7ois had seen the decision of the high command emerging and had tried to prevent it.

They were severely shaken by the previous battle and completely surprised when they recognized the changed situation on the morning of August 21st.

If the enemy continued to act even somewhat correctly\u2014and this had to be assumed at first\u2014the retreat behind the Vistula was necessary. Accordingly, Colonel General v. Prittwitz, on the evening of August 20, quite logically expressed his intention to retreat behind the Vistula to the commanding generals of the I and XVII Army Corps. The stage inspections were informed in the same sense. The first measures of the High Command also corresponded to this intention: They ensured that the Vistula fortresses received back the troops assigned to them, although this had to weaken the resistance against the Narew Army on the East Prussian eastern border. As far as the units could not be transported west by rail, they were assigned retreat routes as far north as possible to avoid contact with the enemy.  \nThe decision to continue the retreat behind the Vistula, however, was not yet so firm, especially with the Chief of the General Staff, Count Waldersee, that it could be included in the written orders and in the report to the Supreme Army Command. Perhaps freedom of movement, especially against the Narew Army, had to be fought for first. On the other hand, the High Command\u2014probably with the sole exception of the Commander-in-Chief himself\u2014had not given up hope that the situation might still be more favorable. They wanted to secure leeway for this. Thus, in the final orders to the troops and in the report to the Supreme Army Command, in accordance with the Chief of the General Staff's view and his collaboration, West Prussia was indicated as the retreat's destination.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "106": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Am Mittag des 20.

A generally optimistic view prevailed: the withdrawal had not been disturbed by the enemy anywhere, but nothing was known about the 1st Cavalry Division. General v. Scholtz reported that he had moved his XX Army Corps further west during the night to attack the enemy advancing on Mlawa as soon as they resumed their march. By 8:30 in the morning, however, this enemy had not yet reappeared. Generaloberst v. Prittwitz approved the general's intention and also placed the fortress troops of Generalmajor v. Unger under his command. The directive issued the previous evening, which foresaw their withdrawal to the fortresses without serious combat, was thus rescinded. The two Danzig battalions had already departed according to the earlier order. Nevertheless, further reinforcement of the troops on the southern front remained particularly urgent to secure the army's retreat and prevent the enemy from pushing between the Vistula and the troops of General v. Scholtz. For this, it was planned to move the I Army Corps via Dirschau to the area of Graudenz, the 3rd Reserve Division, and the 6th Landwehr Brigade to Deutsch-Eylau. The railways could not achieve more. Still, it was hoped that by August 26, troops amounting to almost 7 divisions (I Army Corps, XX Army Corps, 3rd Reserve Division, 6th and 70th Landwehr Brigade, and fortress troops) would be united against the advance of the Russian Narew Army. This Russian army could have reached the area of Osterode\u2014Allenstein by then. However, it was hoped to hold them off with the new forces long enough until the German troops on foot march (XVII Army Corps, I Reserve Corps, 1st Cavalry Division) were safe. Parts of them also had to fend off the Njemen Army. \u2014 The main reserve K\u00f6nigsberg had to be returned to its fortress; additionally, the 2nd Landwehr Brigade joined. This was the minimum force the fortress governor needed for defense when he was left to his own devices.\nOn August 21 at 9:30 in the morning, the Supreme Army Command called the Army High Command from Coblenz. Communication was very difficult at such a great distance at that time, partly only possible by relaying through Berlin.\nAt the Great Headquarters, the development of events in the east had been followed with growing tension: At noon on August 20, the 8th Army reported that it was in a temporarily favorable position in the battle at Gumbinnen.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>den Kampf bei Gumbinnen.</fragment_2>", "107": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Ein solcher R\u00fcckzug war allenfalls zu ertragen, wenn kr\u00e4ftige Hilfe\".

According to it, the I Army Corps had achieved a complete victory: \"Many prisoners, much material, enemy in retreat along the entire line. The battle will continue tomorrow.\" \u2014 And so the disappointment was greater when, during the night, the report from Colonel General v. Prittwitz followed: \"As strong forces from Warsaw\u2014Lomsha are advancing, I cannot exploit the situation in front of my line and will retreat to West Prussia during the night. As much rail transport as possible.\" This report was supplemented on the early morning of August 21 with further details about the course of the battle. It was determined that the attack had stalled along the entire front during the day. However, the commander had so far decided, based on the reports about the Warsaw enemy, to \"initially retreat behind the Angerapp.\" This was in contradiction to the intention reported during the night. Since nothing had been reported about the severe setback at the XVII Army Corps until then, there was an impression in Coblenz that a promising battle had been abandoned. Thus, the Supreme Army Command inquired early on August 21 at the High Command: \"His Majesty demands a clear statement of what is actually intended, whether an offensive is not possible.\"\nThe Army High Command replied that an offensive against the Njemen Army was no longer possible. It justified this response now also with the condition of the XVII Army Corps and provided details about orders and intentions: The I Reserve Corps should hold a fortified position at the Angerapp, the XVII Army Corps should retreat as far north as possible against the Vistula, the I Army Corps, if possible, should be transported by rail to Graudenz. In Coblenz, this report gave the impression that the 8th Army was in full retreat to the Vistula and in doing so was further splintering its already weak forces. Such a retreat had to end behind the Vistula.\nThe Supreme Army Command saw such a retreat behind the Vistula as such a severe disadvantage that Colonel General v. Moltke, as he had already stipulated in the instructions for the deployment of the 8th Army, could only give his consent in the \"utmost emergency.\" Such a retreat was at best tolerable if strong assistance from the West was in sight.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>dem Westen in naher Aussicht stand.</fragment_2>", "108": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"indem er ihm vor allem einen Angriff l\u00e4ngs der Seenkette nach S\u00fcden gegen den Ostfl\u00fcgel der Narew-Armee nahelegte.\" This appears to be a complete sentence, ending with a period.\n\n<fragment_1>indem er ihm vor allem einen Angriff l\u00e4ngs der Seenkette nach S\u00fcden gegen den Ostfl\u00fcgel der Narew-Armee nahelegte.</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"Im Armee-Hauptquartier Bartenstein waren inzwischen weiter g\u00fcnstige Nachrichten eingegangen.\" This is a complete sentence on its own and does not logically or grammatically continue `fragment_1`.\n\n<fragment_2>Im Armee-Hauptquartier Bartenstein waren inzwischen weiter g\u00fcnstige Nachrichten eingegangen.</fragment_2>\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` is a complete sentence, ending with a period.\n- `fragment_2` is also a complete sentence and does not logically or grammatically continue `fragment_1`.\n- The fragments are independent and do not logically or grammatically connect into a single sentence.\n\n<decision>The fragments do not align and do not form a single coherent sentence.</decision>\n</thinking>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>105</pageno>\n<header>August 21st. \u2014 The Intervention of the Supreme Army Command.</header>\n<body>was in close prospect in the West. However, on August 21st, there was no\nthought of this. The effects of an evacuation of East Prussia were not\nlimited to this area. If the Russians advanced to the Vistula, as was to be\nexpected, they would tie down the German 8th Army there with minimal\nforces and gain free rein against Posen and Silesia or against Austria-Hungary.\nThey could turn with overwhelming superiority against the allied army,\nwhich was just about to launch an offensive east of the Vistula from Galicia.\nThe retreat of the 8th Army from East Prussia would have posed an almost\ninsoluble task for the Danube Monarchy and, in all likelihood, would have\nresulted in the retreat of its army. Therefore, everything had to be done\nto keep the 8th Army east of the Vistula.\nThere is no evidence that, besides the compelling reasons of major warfare,\ncultural, economic, or purely local considerations influenced the decision\nof the Supreme Army Command. Indeed, by abandoning the area east of\nthe Vistula, lasting German land and cities of ancient culture were left to\nthe power of Russian soldiers. Irreplaceable stocks of horses and cattle\nand the entire harvest would have had to be abandoned, especially since\nEngland's entry into the war made it economically no easy decision.\nNevertheless, it would have been made if the continuation of operations\nhad become necessary. But it was precisely this that demanded the holding\nof East Prussia. This reason alone was decisive.\nAccording to Generaloberst v. Moltke, it was only possible for the 8th Army\nto continue holding east of the Vistula if it dared another battle there with\nthe aim of decisively defeating one of the two Russian armies. If this was\nno longer possible against the Njemen Army, then it should be attempted\nagainst the Narew Army. For this, however, the German forces had to be\nmore concentrated than seemed to be intended by the 8th Army's high\ncommand according to its latest report. Generaloberst v. Moltke, who was\nnot directly under the impression of the events and the news from the\nbattlefield like the army high command, did not assess the operational\ncapability of the Russians so highly that he considered a battle against the\nNarew Army, even with the Rennenkampf Army on the flank or rear,\nimpossible. He considered the Masurian Lakes as flank protection. In this\nsense, the Quartermaster General, Lieutenant General v. Stein, initially\nsought to influence his plan on the General Staff of the 8th Army by\nespecially suggesting an attack along the chain of lakes to the south\nagainst the eastern flank of the Narew Army.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "109": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Er wurde in dieser Auffassung best\u00e4rkt, als die\".

However, Major General Count Waldersee and his first General Staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann, were now agreed to \"unite the army in West Prussia on the right wing to advance against the left wing of the Narew Army.\" For this purpose, the I Army Corps was to be moved to G\u00f6bershausen (30 km east of Graudenz), the 3rd Reserve Division and the 6th Landwehr Brigade to Deutsch-Eylau, while the other corps continued their march westward.\nJust before these intentions were presented to the commander-in-chief, Generaloberst v. Prittwitz was called to the telephone by the Supreme Army Command, where he first spoke with Lieutenant General v. Stein, then with Generaloberst v. Moltke himself. In this conversation, he mentioned no intentions of attack, but rather described the situation as extremely bleak, perhaps to lend more emphasis to his simultaneous request for reinforcements. Generaloberst v. Moltke finally said (according to his notes written down 5 days later): \"If you have to retreat, your further task is definitely to hold the Vistula line.\" But even that, the army leader could not firmly promise: \"How am I supposed to hold the Vistula with a handful of troops, it can be waded through anywhere.\"\nThis discussion led the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army to decide to make a change in the command of the 8th Army. Generaloberst v. Moltke had the impression that in its current composition, it was not up to the extraordinarily difficult situation brought about by the overwhelming Russian superiority in the east. He was reinforced in this view when the evening report of the High Command explicitly rejected the attack direction recommended by the Supreme Army Command against the eastern wing of the Narew Army, but mentioned nothing of any other intention to attack.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Abendmeldung des Oberkommandos die von der Obersten Heeresleitung empfohlene Angriffsrichtung gegen den Ostfl\u00fcgel der Narew-Armee nochmals ausdr\u00fccklich ablehnte, von einer sonstigen Angriffsabsicht aber nichts erw\u00e4hnte.</fragment_2>", "110": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Als sie tags darauf wieder An-\".

Finally, it was also reported that the High Command had departed from Bartenstein to M\u00fchlhausen (east of Elbing) in the evening and, as the officer left behind reported, intended to continue to Drischau a day later. The stage inspection was to be relocated from there to Konitz. After all this, the Supreme Army Command had no more doubts that Generaloberst v. Prittwitz intended to withdraw his army behind the Vistula.\nGeneraloberst v. Moltke, however, in order to gain clarity about the overall situation, also had inquiries made with the XX Army Corps, which had to be best informed about the advance of the Narew Army. The corps reported very confidently on the evening of August 21 that it expected the Russian attack in a position on both sides of Gilgenburg only in two to three days and hoped to be able to transition to the attack from this position. It also estimated the enemy at only 2 to 2\u00bd corps, thus weaker than the High Command had assumed. Its concerns therefore did not seem justified.\nNevertheless, it was not an easy decision for the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army to propose to his Supreme War Lord the relocation of the High Command to the East. It was the first such case. The Supreme Army Command could not yet oversee the situation on the distant theater of war with the inadequate telephone connections at that time as it was mostly possible in later years with reliable communication. Also, the selection of suitable men for the independent position and the unusually difficult situation in the East was not easy. Generaloberst v. Moltke proposed to the Commander-in-Chief General of Infantry z. D. v. Beneckendorff and v. Hindenburg with Major General Ludendorff as Chief of the General Staff. On August 22 at noon, the Kaiser carried out their appointment; in the evening of that day, it was announced to the High Command of the 8th Army in M\u00fchlhausen.\nThere, the hope for a favorable development of the situation had meanwhile further solidified: On the evening of August 21, while still in Bartenstein, during the telephone conversation that Generaloberst v. Prittwitz conducted, the report arrived that the 1st Cavalry Division had reassembled. The withdrawal order had not reached them on the evening of the Battle of Gumbinnen. When they resumed contact with their own troops the next day, they had still found the way to the west open and even brought back 500 prisoners.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>schlu\u00df an eigene Truppen suchte, hatte sie aber den Weg nach Westen noch frei gefunden und brachte nun sogar 500 Gefangene zur\u00fcck.</fragment_2>", "111": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"kraftvoll durchzusetzen.\" This appears to be a complete sentence as it ends with a period and expresses a complete thought.\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"Die Schlacht bei Tannenberg.\" This is a header and does not logically or grammatically continue `fragment_1`.\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` is a complete sentence and ends with a period.\n- `fragment_2` is a header and does not continue `fragment_1`.\n- The fragments are independent and do not logically or grammatically connect into a single sentence.\n</thinking>\n\n<fragment_1>kraftvoll durchzusetzen.</fragment_1>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>\n\n<decision>The fragments do not align and do not form a single coherent sentence.</decision>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>108</pageno>\n<header>The Recall of Colonel General v.

Thus, the idea had increasingly taken shape at the German\nArmy High Command to assemble the army on the right wing, to make\nan offensive thrust from the Thorn\u2014Allenstein line. In addition, the\nproposal of the Supreme Army Command to tackle the eastern wing of\nthe Narew Army was now being seriously considered. Perhaps the\nNarew Army could be enveloped on both sides! This idea was in the air\ndue to the similar training of all German senior leaders and general staff\nofficers. So, Colonel General v. Prittwitz also expressed the intention in\na report drafted on the night of August 21/22, \"if the enemy pushes back\nGeneral v.

General Ludendorff was well known to Generaloberst v. Moltke, as he had served under him until spring 1913, for nine years, in the Great General Staff in the deployment department, lastly as its chief. In the war, he initially held the same position as Chief Quartermaster of the 2nd Army.\nOn the orders of his commander, he had attended the coup at Li\u00e8ge and, when everything was at stake, intervened decisively. His personal courage and unyielding will were primarily responsible for the fall of the fortress. This deed found its external recognition through the Order pour le m\u00e9rite.\nGeneraloberst v. Moltke announced his new task to General Ludendorff in writing: \"You will be faced with a difficult task, perhaps even more difficult than the storming of Li\u00e8ge. I know no other man in whom I would have such unconditional trust as in you. Perhaps you will still save the situation in the East...\"\nOn August 22 at 6 p.m., General Ludendorff arrived in Coblenz.\nIn the meantime, Generaloberst v. Moltke had obtained more detailed information about the situation in East Prussia through direct inquiries with the commanding generals of the 8th Army. The special circumstances justified this unusual measure. It seemed particularly important to learn the opinion of the XX Army Corps, which stood directly opposite the advancing Narew Army.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>der anr\u00fcckenden Narew-Armee unmittelbar gegen\u00fcberstand.</fragment_2>", "114": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die Ziele seien jetzt schon s\u00fcflich\".

Prittwitz himself had represented to the Supreme Army Command. Since the conversation with him on the evening of August 21st, the High Command had not been heard from.\nOn the evening of August 22nd, Generaloberst v. Moltke discussed the situation with General Ludendorff. In the organization of the 8th Army, two groups seemed to be forming: a Western Group (I. and reinforced XX. Army Corps, 3rd Reserve Division) and an Eastern Group (XVII. Army Corps, I. Reserve Corps, Main Reserve K\u00f6nigsberg, 1st Cavalry Division).\nGeneraloberst v. Moltke and the new Chief of Staff of the 8th Army agreed that under the given circumstances, the Western Group should primarily strike against the Russian Narew Army. For this, General Ludendorff demanded their reinforcement by all available forces of the Vistula fortresses. The fortresses should now, on the 21st day of mobilization, be able to provide more than had been made available to General v. Scholz so far. The I. Army Corps was to be unloaded close to the XX. Army Corps, at Deutsch-Eylau, while the reinforcement troops from the fortresses were to reach Goslershausen and Strasburg on August 23rd.\nTo what extent the Eastern Group was tied down by the Rennenkampf Army, whether it could be led sharply south behind the lakes against the eastern flank of the Narew Army or whether it was better to bring it to battle in a southwesterly direction with the rest of the army, was not yet clear. It seemed necessary to initially halt their retreat westward for August 23rd.\nIn any case, it was important that the sea area be blocked for the enemy and thus the separation of the two Russian armies be maintained as long as possible. It also had to be prevented that the previously eastward-directed barrier fortifications were opened from behind.\nThe Supreme Army Command gave the troops and fortresses in the east the corresponding orders directly on the evening of August 22nd. The previous High Command was believed to be in Dirschau and was informed of the arrival of the new commander-in-chief and his chief in Marienburg for noon on August 23rd.\n</body>\n<footer>World War.

Only now did it become apparent that the previous High Command had also planned a strike against the Narew Army. The views of Major General Gr\u00fcnert and Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann were in complete agreement with those of their new superiors.\nThe situation in the East had further developed favorably. It presented the following picture:\nAmong the allies, the start of the offensive was expected in at most a week. The Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff, General v.

It was not possible to comply with this request for the time being. \u2014 On the left flank of the Austrians, the German Landwehr Corps under General of the Infantry v.

However, the center of the Narew Army had come so close from Neidenburg to the German XX Army Corps that General v.

Behind the eastern flank of the position, the 3rd Reserve Division had almost completed its task at Allenstein. General v. Scholtz now saw his task, given the great Russian superiority also recognized at the XX Army Corps, primarily in defense. He had the 3rd Reserve Division at his disposal to be able to strike against the flank of the Russian attack from Allenstein. In the further course, he hoped that the I Army Corps would engage against one Russian flank, and the XVII Army Corps and the I Reserve Corps against the other. These plans also corresponded to the views of the Army High Command.\nThe transport of the I Army Corps, according to the initial orders of the High Command, secured against enemy interference, was to begin on August 24 at Wehlau and K\u00f6nigsberg. In an effort to expedite the transport and spare the troops long marches, the Corps Command had already begun the transport under the protection of the main reserve K\u00f6nigsberg on August 22 via the railway line to the west. In Insterburg, the loading had to be stopped the following morning due to enemy threat, soon thereafter due to a lack of empty trains, it was completely interrupted for about 12 hours.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>wegen Mangels an Leerz\u00fcgen auf etwa 12 Stunden ganz unterbrochen worden</fragment_2>", "118": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Im \u00e4u\u00dfersten Nordzipfel Ostpreu\u00dfens hielt Landsturm bei Heilsberg und Mewe eine Wacht.\" This sentence appears to be complete as it ends with a period and expresses a complete thought.\n\n<fragment_1>Im \u00e4u\u00dfersten Nordzipfel Ostpreu\u00dfens hielt Landsturm bei Heilsberg und Mewe eine Wacht.</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"Die russische Njemen-Armee unter General v.

Thus, from the fighting troops of the corps, only the first parts (Grenadier Regiment 1) had been unloaded and were marching on L\u00f6bau; the last could not arrive in Bischofswerder and Deutsch-Eylau until the evening of August 25 at the earliest. \u2014 From the fortress of Thorn, a mixed brigade gathered under the commander of the 5th Landwehr Brigade, Lieutenant General v. M\u00fcllmann, near Strasburg and to the west.\nEast of the XX Army Corps, the fortifications at Ortelsburg had to be abandoned due to the Russian advance. In the fortifications of the Johannisburger Heide and up to the Spirdingsee, there were still Landsturm troops; they were instructed to retreat to L\u00f6tzen. There, the general command of the XX Army Corps, based on orders from Coblenz, had held back the 6th Landwehr Brigade, originally intended for transport, to secure the lake narrows against the west. \u2014 The enemy had reached Johannisburg with cavalry and probed from the east against the lake barriers. Here, intercepted Russian radio messages confirmed the approach of the Russian II Corps. Whether this corps would turn against the lake barriers or bypass the lake area to the north or south was not yet clear.\nThe retreat of the German eastern group had not been disturbed by the enemy in any way. The I Reserve Corps and the XVII Army Corps were located on and west of the main road Nordenburg\u2014Insterburg, on their northern flank the completely exhausted 1st Cavalry Division, due to the efforts in border protection of the last battles. It had been reinforced the day before by the J\u00e4ger Battalion 2, previously used in border protection. \"No rest day in three weeks; finally attack and thirty rides; too little water, no supplies, additional load consumed, horses exhausted, only half combat strength; transport necessary to gain a rest day,\" was the report of the only cavalry unit available to the army. But the situation did not allow the justified desire for rest to be fulfilled. At Nortitten, the main reserve K\u00f6nigsberg covered the loading of the I Army Corps, while other troops of the fortress occupied the Deime position, which was still under construction.

Rennenkampf was still identified by aerial reconnaissance on the morning of August 22 with its main forces on the battlefield of the 20th. Only advance troops and patrol units had followed towards the Angerapp and Inster and had crossed the former at Darkehmen and Nemmersdorf.\nDue to the preceding battles, the composition and strength of the Njemen Army had become partially known. It counted at least 3 corps, 1 rifle brigade, and 5\u00bd cavalry divisions. Reinforcements were arriving behind them. It was primarily expected that the Russian Guard Corps, known to have departed for Wilna, was now assumed to be at Pillkallen, behind the northern flank of the army. East of the Inster, there was no enemy so far.\nThe intentions of the Russians became clear, if they could still be doubtful at all, from a Russian order that the German I Reserve Corps had captured at Gawaiten and now presented. According to this, the Russian 1st Army was to attack the enemy presumed to be behind the Angerapp, and the 2nd was to flank them. The waiting behavior of the Njemen Army did not correspond to this. It confirmed the peace view of the General Staff that the Russians were slow and cumbersome in their movements and did not understand how to quickly exploit a favorable operational situation. Thus, the hope grew that it might be possible to also lead the German eastern group against the Narew Army. And it had to be said with certainty that General v. Rennenkampf now, having found the Angerapp position unoccupied by his cavalry, had to see clearly. It could not be otherwise than that he would resume and advance westward as quickly as he could. An intercepted Russian radio message also indicated such an intention. It spoke of transitioning to attack and an attack order for the Russian IV Corps.\nFor the new commander-in-chief of the 8th Army and his chief of staff, the decision was clear from the start to exploit the separation of the Russian armies for a decisive blow against the Narew Army. This blow could only succeed as long as the Rennenkampf Army was still far enough separated from the Samsonow Army. Time was pressing, especially since several days \u2014 General Ludendorff estimated about three days \u2014 had to be accounted for the battle itself.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 98.\n2) It was an abridged version of the \"Directive\" of the Russian Army Group Command of the Northwestern Front from August 13 (p. 67).</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>General Ludendorff rechnete etwa drei Tage \u2014 in Ansatz gebracht werden mu\u00dften.</fragment_2>", "120": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Wie stark sie sein w\u00fcrden, hing vom Abmarsch der Njemen-Armee ab.

Therefore, it was necessary to stop the Narew Army already near the border. With every step it gained ground northward, it approached the Njemen Army and restricted the freedom of movement of the German army between the two Russian ones. Thus, the troops of General v. Scholtz had to hold their position despite the enemy's superiority until the I Army Corps and reinforcements from the fortresses arrived; with these, everything had to be done to expedite their arrival for battle to the utmost. Therefore, the I Army Corps received orders to advance the unloaded troops immediately to the line Neumark\u2014south of L\u00f6bau and to close up there. The advance should occur immediately after the unloading of the said troops.\nIf General Samsonow, as expected, attacked General v. Scholtz in the coming days, then the I Army Corps was intended to strike his west flank and perhaps also his rear. In this sense, General v. Fran\u00e7ois was informed, who reported to the commander-in-chief while passing through Marienburg. It was determined that the I Army Corps could only engage in battle on August 26 at noon. The XX Army Corps was instructed to hold out accordingly with its forces, particularly to initially hold back the 3rd Reserve Division near Allenstein.\nSince the Russian Narew Army, with 5 active corps and 4 cavalry divisions, was already superior to all German forces in East Prussia, the last man and the last gun had to be brought to battle from the German side. Whatever was still usable in the field from the garrison troops of the Vistula fortresses, especially the horse-drawn artillery of these fortresses, was to participate. For this, the border west of Soldau had to be stripped, despite the impending Russian cavalry raid there. The advancing fortress troops were to accompany the attack of the I Army Corps on the southern flank.\nThe question of how to further employ the Eastern Group was more difficult. A march directly west or even south, as had once been envisioned by Generaloberst v. Moltke for the entire 8th Army, was no longer conceivable given the current situation. However, they wanted to bring as strong parts as possible into battle against the Narew Army. How strong they would be depended on the march of the Njemen Army. This was to be fended off by weak forces.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "121": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"dem XVII.

However, the 6th Landwehr Brigade could not be left at L\u00f6tzen for this purpose. The commander of the Boyen Fortress, Colonel B\u00fc\u00dfe, had to manage with his own forces and the militia from the Johannisburg Heath. Thus, he had only 4\u00bd battalions (more than half of which were militia), 1 squadron, and a number of older guns at his disposal, an extremely small force despite the natural strength of the positions; more could not be deployed for a secondary task.\nIn the north, the Pregel and Deime lines, as outposts of the K\u00f6nigsberg Fortress, restricted the advance of the Russian Njemen Army. These positions were still under construction. The main reserve of the fortress, designated for their occupation, initially still had to cover the loading of the I Army Corps; otherwise, it was available for its new task and was again subordinated to the governor of the fortress.\nBetween the lake area and the Pregel, a space of still 60 km remained free. Here, parts of the eastern group, especially the 1st Cavalry Division, probably had to remain to cover against the Russian Njemen Army. The XVII Army Corps was therefore to initially retreat behind the Alle on August 24th. From there, it could be redirected under the protection of a task depending on the situation, if possible against the right wing of the Narew Army. The I Reserve Corps was already deployed in this direction, and the 6th Landwehr Brigade was to move up to it. However, when the evening reports from the front indicated that the Njemen Army had again made only a very short march westward and had crossed the Darkehmen\u2014Insterburg line (halfway between Gumbinnen\u2014Insterburg) only with smaller cavalry detachments, the army command decided to give both corps of the eastern group a movement in a southern direction, towards Allenstein. The distance from the enemy, which was only a strong day's march, had to be extended by greater marching efforts, and a part of the XVII Army Corps was likely to be left behind at the Alle to conceal the turn to the southwest together with the 1st Cavalry Division and to hold back the advancing Russians. Accordingly, the I Reserve Corps received orders to gain as much ground as possible beyond Schippenbeil on August 24th, in order to advance beyond Seeburg on the 25th; the XVII Army Corps was given the continuation of the march from Friedland via Bartenstein on August 25th.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>den 25.

In the further course of the movements, the two corps had to strike the flank of the Narew Army.\nThese orders from General v. Hindenburg on the afternoon and evening of his arrival in Marienburg set almost all the forces available east of the Vistula, as far as they could be used in the open field, in motion for an attack on the Narew Army. By August 26, they were to be united \"with the XX Army Corps for a comprehensive attack,\" as reported to the Supreme Army Command on the evening of the 23rd: 11 1/2 divisions of infantry were to advance for the decisive battle, 1 1/2 divisions (main reserve K\u00f6nigsberg with 2nd Landwehr Brigade) and the 1st Cavalry Division were to repel the Njemen Army.\nAnd yet, the new High Command, even with the greatest boldness of the attack plan, did not neglect the necessary caution. At the same time, the question was considered of what should happen if the strike against the Narew Army failed. Even then, they wanted to try to hold their ground east of the Vistula; the river crossings were to be kept open for the intervention of forces expected later from the west.

His foremost troops barely went beyond the battlefield on August 21. Even the strong cavalry of the northern flank only pushed weak parts up to Gr\u00fcnheide (20 km north of Insterburg), where they remained the following day. In an army order from August 22, it was still stated: \"The enemy was repelled on the entire front on August 20.

He began the advance on August 23. Meanwhile, the army had been reinforced on the right flank by the 56th Reserve Division and the artillery brigade of the 73rd Reserve Division, which had been brought in from Wirballen. On the left flank, the army group command, apparently before it knew of the evacuation of the Angerapp position, had made the II Corps, previously belonging to the 2nd Army, available on August 22.

The appearance of further forces from Thorn was expected. Moreover, the advance of the German Landwehr Corps, whose northern division reached Petrikau via Sjerads on August 20, had aroused anticipation of a German operation against Warsaw. Since this important place was declared a fortress, its extensive works were without protection and without garrison. The German advance would have led into the rear of the Narew Army and, above all, questioned the assembly of the 9th Army intended against Posen west of the Vistula. Under these circumstances, the two cavalry divisions previously used there seemed no longer sufficient to protect the assembly area.

In the following days, all \ntroops near and west of Warsaw were subordinated to it. Among them were two \ninfantry regiments from the I Corps, the 5th and the Caucasian \nCavalry Division already present, the Guard Cossack Brigade from \nPetersburg and a Turkestan Cossack Brigade on the move, \nas well as the garrisons for Warsaw, 59th, and 77th, and Novo- \ngeorgiewsk, 79th Reserve Division. While the 2nd Army advanced to attack \nnorthward, these 5 1/2 infantry divisions and \n3 1/2 cavalry divisions were assigned a secondary task: the commanding \ngeneral of the Guard Corps, General Bespajrow, was to \ncover between Warsaw and its Vistula crossings, clear the land up to the \nline Plock\u2014Lodz\u2014Petrikau\u2014Piliza course from the enemy and \nprepare the later attack in the direction of Bromberg\u2014Posen. \nWhile the Guard Corps was thus completely excluded from the operations of General \nSamsonow, its authority over the (weakened by two regiments) I Corps was simultaneously restricted, \nso that the corps could only be advanced to the area of Soldau. \nThe main task of this corps was to cover the attack movement of the \n2nd Army against Thorn; only if there was no danger from this side \nshould it be drawn into battle. \nAfter these assignments and restrictions, the \nforces with which General Samsonow could appear on the battlefield in the coming days \nhad melted down against the first approach. However, they were considered sufficient, in cooperation \nwith the Njemen Army, to prepare the downfall of the German forces, which had until then been assumed to be behind the lakes, \nespecially since these were now considered defeated after the battles of Stallup\u00f6nen and Gumbinnen. \nThis view, that the 1st and 2nd Armies should suffice for the battle \nin East Prussia, had some justification. \nThe withdrawal of the very strong security forces for western \nPoland was, however, a voluntary renunciation of a surplus of forces \nfor the decision initially intended in East Prussia. \nThe Narew Army had advanced on August 21 and 22 in small marches, \nwith four corps in the front line and a front width of almost \n80 km, not as ordered not west of the \nlakes to the north, but in an almost northwesterly direction. This \ndirection seemed operationally particularly effective, also exerting attraction beyond the railway \nto Allenstein. The high command was \nin Ostrolenka. The Supreme Army Command and Army Group Command, \nwhich had been in Bjelostok since August 19, urged haste.

In the army's advance area, only a single road led east of Chorzele, at Myszyniez, across the border, the only railway lay on the extreme left flank, and here also ran the only telegraph lines into Germany. This had to be particularly noticeable for the communication of the army high command with the general commands and among themselves given the wide front.\nFor August 23, General Samsonow had only ordered the center of his army to continue the march: the VI Corps and the 4th Cavalry Division were to remain, for unknown reasons, at Ortelsburg, the I Corps at Soldau, the 6th and 15th Cavalry Divisions to further reconnoiter on the western flank and interrupt the Allenstein\u2014Deutsch-Eylau railway.

The division only moved into this position on the morning of August 23, when reports from the enemy revealed their advance. Below Orlau, the Alle crossings up to Lansker Lake were secured by individual companies. 36 km north of Orlau, the 3rd Reserve Division arrived at Allenstein. \u2014 The extensive position of the reinforced XX Army Corps was high in its western half, offering a wide view into the open terrain and was protected by the Welle course and forward lowlands. In the east, however, the natural strength of the position was weaker. From Lahna, it ran behind the partially swampy Alle ground. Before this section, the villages of Lahna and Orlau were weakly occupied. Large lakes offered protection on the eastern flank, but the mighty forests east of the Neidenburg\u2014Allenstein line remained a constant danger here.\nThe XX Army Corps was generally well informed about the enemy: In front of the western flank, he seemed to hold back, although he was strong here. He had only slightly advanced beyond Soldau. Near Neidenburg and eastward, however, the Russians seemed to be advancing closer during the course of August 23, especially by exploiting the large forests. General v. Scholtz had therefore sent all available forces to assist the 37th Infantry Division and instructed the 3rd Reserve Division to be ready for an advance east of Lansker Lake to the south on August 24.\nIn the afternoon hours, the Russian attack developed against the German positions east of Kowmattken Lake. At Frantenau, the Russians were repelled. At Lahna and Orlau, the situation remained unclear for a long time. After intense fighting, it seemed not to be going well there in the evening. Upon receiving the news that the enemy had advanced to the heights north of the Alle at Orlau, General v. Scholtz intended to retake them the next morning. The 3rd Reserve Division was to simultaneously advance over the ridges to the left corps flank. On the heights already captured by this division, it was possible to support the 37th Infantry Division, which had marched into the enemy's flank, as the evening brought the directive of the army high command, which agreed on \"conserving forces and temporarily holding back the 3rd Reserve Division at Allenstein.\"</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>commandos<sup>1)</sup> einig, die \u201eHaushalten mit den Kr\u00e4ften und vorl\u00e4ufiges Zur\u00fcckhalten der 3.

General v. Scholz abandoned the counterattack and decided, in agreement with the Army High Command, to withdraw his left flank to initially avoid further enemy attacks.\nMeanwhile, the battle at the 37th Infantry Division had concluded with a full German success. The General Command learned of this only on the morning of August 24. Only the village of Lahna, located in front of the main position, was lost. Otherwise, the brave troops of the 73rd Infantry Brigade, especially the 2nd Masurian Infantry Regiment No. 147 and the East Prussian J\u00e4ger Battalion Graf Yorck v. Wartenburg No. 1, repelled the enemy, often in fierce close combat, and in a counterattack on both sides of Orlau even took the heights south of the Alle Valley in front of their own position. The enemy had withdrawn here. Correctly assessing the overall situation, the brigade commander, Major General Wilhelmi, led his disorganized troops back to their original positions on the northern Alle bank at night.\nIn this situation, the Chief of Staff of the Corps, Colonel Hell, asked the division at 20:00 at night if it was possible to disengage from the enemy. He pointed out that it would be daylight in two hours. When Lieutenant General v. Staabs still affirmed the question, he received the order to retreat on both sides of the M\u00fchlen Lake. General v. Scholz now intended to assign the 37th Infantry Division, in connection with the 41st at Thura, a position on both sides of the M\u00fchlen Lake; its eastern flank was to cover the Hohensteiner Road south of Paulsgut. Then there was still room for a counterattack by the 3rd Reserve Division from the north to the large lakes. The 70th Landwehr Brigade, previously deployed between the 41st and 37th Infantry Divisions, was withdrawn as a reserve group to the area south of M\u00fchlen.\nThe troops could still begin the ordered movements early on August 24 in darkness.

In Anticipation of the Russian Attack.</header>\n<body>On August 24, the High Command of the German 8th Army was moved from Marienburg behind the forming attack wing of the army to Riesenburg. The commander-in-chief arrived around noon with his close staff for a meeting at the headquarters of the XX Army Corps in Tannenberg.\nGeneral v. Scholtz and his chief of staff, Colonel Hell, did not yet have a clear picture of the events at the 37th Infantry Division, as is known today from the enemy's perspective. At the headquarters, as well as within the division itself, the predominant impression was of the difficult night retreat from an overwhelming enemy, and the situation was seen as serious. Although there was apparently no immediate threat to the eastern flank of the corps, according to the available reports, an encirclement by the enemy over Schwetzkowo towards Hohenstein was expected for August 25. This prospect led General v. Scholtz to decide to further refuse the left wing of the corps by withdrawing the position of the 41st and 37th Infantry Divisions to the Gilgenburg\u2014M\u00fchlen line. At the same time, he wanted to bring the 3rd Reserve Division to the left wing at K\u00f6niglich Lichteinen. Then the Russians would have to extend their attack further and turn their backs on the advancing German eastern group. However, their intervention was by no means certain and was expected only after several days. Everything depended on the XX Army Corps holding out alone against the superior force for some time; it was, as General Ludendorff expressed it, the \"unburned rock.\" Thus, General v. Hindenburg decided that the 3rd Reserve Division should not be brought so close yet, but rather remain more detached, north of Hohenstein and Soldau, and only align with General v. Scholtz's intentions. He expected that the XX Army Corps, in the now chosen position, could hold out until the intervention of the I Army Corps on August 26.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>bis zum Eingreifen des I.

The Landwehr was expected to deal with it during further\nmarching. Therefore, one could not place too much hope on the\nintervention of the Landwehr Brigade in the expected battle.\nIn the transport of the I Army Corps, another delay had occurred.\nThe early withdrawal of the K\u00f6nigsberg main reserve, tasked with\ncovering the loadings, had necessitated multiple relocations of the\nloadings. So far, apart from the regiment to be handed over to the\nXX Army Corps, only one infantry regiment and one battery of each\ndivision had been unloaded and advanced with the planned parts to\nNeumark and L\u00f6bau. The troops also arrived in a tactically undesirable\norder due to the loading from the retreat and the necessary relocation\nof the loading points; the cavalry and the bulk of the artillery only\narrived at the end. Under these circumstances, the use of the closed\narmy corps could not be expected before noon on August 26. Until then,\nthe troops of General v. Scholz had to rely on themselves.\nIn front of their front, since the retreat of the 37th Infantry Division\nand the fire attack on Russian cavalry at Usdau, there had been no more\nclashes. However, the enemy seemed to be so closely assembled\neverywhere that an attack against the entire front of the XX Army Corps\nhad to be expected on August 25, perhaps early in the morning at\nSilgenburg, and in the afternoon at M\u00fchlen and Hohenstein.\nThe reports available indicated that behind the line\nGeeben (west of Usdau)\u2014Kornanten Lake\u2014southern end of the Great\nMaransen Lake, 3\u00bd Russian corps were ready.

As long as the German I Army Corps and the 5th Landwehr Brigade had not arrived, 4\u00bd German divisions, of which only 2 were active divisions and 1 reserve division, would have to withstand the assault of 7 active Russian infantry divisions. Considering the superiority of the Russian infantry divisions over the German reserve and Landwehr units in infantry, machine guns, and artillery, a battle against double superiority was expected. The concerns of the XX Army Corps, whether it could withstand such superiority, were therefore not unfounded. However, another retreat was impossible; there was then no room for a multi-day decisive battle. The Russian Njemen Army was meanwhile approaching, the union of both Russian armies could no longer be prevented. The decision that General Ludendorff gave to the Chief of Staff of the XX Army Corps in the evening by telephone was therefore: \"The corps must hold its position to the last man\"\u00b9). The requests of the corps for rapid support by the I Army Corps should, as far as possible, be met.\nThe 5th Landwehr Brigade was subordinated to General v. Fran\u00e7ois and was to reach Lautenburg by 10 a.m. on August 25. The unloaded parts of the I Army Corps were to arrive at the same time northeast of there at Wompierst and Rybno, to flank the expected Russian attack against General v. Scholz. For the morning of August 25, the commander-in-chief announced a meeting with General v. Fran\u00e7ois.\nWhile the beginning of the battle was expected in the western group, the situation had also escalated in the east by the evening of August 24. The 1st Cavalry Division screened north of Gerdauen the departure of the XVII Army Corps, the main reserve K\u00f6nigsberg still covered the loadings of the I Army Corps east of Wehlau. Meanwhile, the I Reserve Corps and the XVII Army Corps had reached the area southeast of Bartenstein and the Alle near Friedland-Allenburg marching west.

Two columns had been observed advancing on Bischofsburg on August 24, this town itself and Sensburg were already occupied by Russian cavalry. The Russian VI Corps thus separated from its army, it seemed to want to reach out to the Njemen Army immediately west of the lakes. This army had been observed between 9 and 10 a.m. with the beginnings of its main body from Darkehmen and advancing northwards, but by noon it seemed to be standing firm again just west of this line, marching east of the lakes on Angerburg.\nThus, there was the possibility of first dealing with the Russian VI Corps in the east. General v. Hindenburg was immediately determined to exploit it. The corps of the German eastern group had to be sharply turned south for this purpose. But what would become of them if racing and fighting continued briskly \u2014 and nothing could prevent that \u2014 or if the German western group failed to achieve success in the coming days? Such thoughts had to be set aside in favor of the unyielding will to victory. \u2014 Thus, the I Reserve Corps was ordered to set out at the earliest hour on August 25 and attack the enemy over Seeburg wherever it found him. However, it was to cover its back as much as possible to the west, towards Guttstadt. The 6th Landwehr Brigade was to move up to the corps. \u2014 The cooperation of the XVII Army Corps was also counted on for the battle, at least of its southern division. The other, northern one, was very far away anyway, and might also be used as a rear guard against the Russian Njemen Army. Extreme marching performances were required from the XVII Army Corps. On August 25, one division was to reach Bischofstein (50 km march), the other, deployed northeast of it, Gro\u00df-Schwansfeld (40 km march). \u2014 The 1st Cavalry Division, which had again\u00b9) requested a rest day, was to cover the march of the two corps southwards at Gedauen.\nAt the headquarters of the German 8th Army, on the evening of August 24, the dangers and responsibilities assumed with the orders for both the western and eastern groups of the army were fully recognized.

The Attack Order to the German Western Group for August 26.\n(Map 5 and Sketch 6, p. 132.)\nIn the early morning of August 25, a communication from the Supreme Army Command arrived at the Army High Command, stating that a Landwehr Division under Lieutenant General Baron von der Goltz, which had previously been stationed in border protection in Northern Schleswig, was made available to the 8th Army. It would not arrive at the theater of war before August 27. Given the unclear situation on the right flank of the army, the High Command temporarily designated Strasburg and Neumarkt as railway destinations for the division.\nAt the front, the night from August 24 to 25 passed quietly, except for a reconnaissance advance by the Russian Infantry Regiment 93 (24th Infantry Division, I Corps) southwards to Gilgenburg, and the morning hours also brought no signs of the expected Russian attack. At the German Army High Command, there was a sense of relief, as the situation improved hour by hour with the arrival of General von Francois's troops.\nThe commander of the 8th Army was determined, if the enemy allowed him the time, to launch his own attack early on August 26. He wanted to stick to this timing for the attack, even if the I Army Corps might not have gathered all the fighting troops by then. Waiting longer was prohibited by the conditions in front of General von Scholtz's front, particularly the looming threat from the Russian Njemen Army in the rear. A multi-day battle had to be fought in the narrow space between two hostile armies. One could not start early enough.\nThe decision had to be sought against the Russian western wing near Usdau.

Previously, it was assumed that the Russian forces stationed at Usdau would join their army for an attack, and accordingly, on August 23, General v. Francois in Marienburg was told he would have to attack the flank and rear of the enemy\u00b9). However, the situation had changed due to the advance of the Russian eastern wing: The advance of the Narew Army had shifted to a pivot around Usdau. It became increasingly likely that the enemy would remain on this flank on August 26, especially since the advance of the German 5th Landwehr Brigade and the two divisions of the I Army Corps must have become known to them. Thus, stronger Russian resistance was to be expected here, which first had to be overcome. The Russian forces at Usdau seemed to have their front to the west and northwest and were deeply structured to the south. Reinforcements could continuously flow to them from Warsaw. The attempt to flank them barely improved the attacker's prospects under these circumstances but wasted time. Thus, the Army High Command had become clear that General v. Francois's troops initially had to attack frontally from the west. Perhaps a certain encirclement could be achieved from the position of the XX Army Corps from the north. This Army Corps had to join the progress of the attack from the western flank.\nGeneral v. Hindenburg wanted to drive to General v. Francois on the morning of August 25 to inform him in this sense about the final attack task of his corps. Before departure, a Russian radio message intercepted at night arrived. It contained, what had not been seen before, a complete army order from General v. Rennenkampf, which had recklessly been given to the Russian IV Corps without encryption. The Njemen Army then intended to reach the line Gerdauen\u2014Allenburg\u2014Wehlau on August 26. This was not unfavorable for the execution of the decisions made so far. The prospect of settling accounts with the Narew Army undisturbed grew.\nAnd now a special stroke of luck added that the High Command, as far as could be determined, was also handed another recently intercepted Russian radio message on the way to L\u00f6bau, which provided information about the movements of the Narew Army.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>der \u00fcber die Bewegungen der Narew-Armee Aufschlu\u00df gab.</fragment_2>", "137": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Auch \u00fcberstiegen die geforderten Marschleistungen kaum 10 km, so da\u00df ein\".

Thus, the more precise knowledge of the enemy, obtained through the intercepted radio message, could no longer influence the decisions made. However, it was welcome as confirmation of the previous own assessment. As an indication that the measures taken were on the right track, it strengthened the Army High Command's confidence in victory.\nIn the morning at 8 o'clock, the Commander-in-Chief, with his staff, arrived at the command post of General v. Francois near Montow, 10 km south of L\u00f6bau. General v. Francois had already reported to the High Command early in the morning how few of his troops had arrived and requested permission to initially hold them behind the large forests at Kielpin and Hartowitz, 6 km back from the line ordered by the Army High Command. General v. Hindenburg had agreed to this not very significant change. He and his Chief of Staff knew General v. Francois from earlier1). The difficulties that had arisen during the Battle of Gumbinnen due to the General's behavior were still fresh in the memory of the High Command's staff. It was expected that General v. Francois would continue to try to assert his own views. In contrast, the new Commander-in-Chief was determined to enforce what he and his Chief of Staff had recognized as correct. During the discussion at the command post, General Ludendorff outlined the intentions of the Commander-in-Chief. General v. Francois expressed concerns about the early timing of the direction of his army corps' attack. After all, so far only 10 battalions of infantry (2\u00bd of which were assigned to the XX Army Corps) had been unloaded, but no squadrons and only two batteries! And trains did not arrive regularly. Even if they were driven forward as far as possible from the morning of that day to Montow itself, it was already apparent, according to General v.

Fran\u00e7ois.</header>\n<body>\nAccording to General v. Fran\u00e7ois, it could already be foreseen that the sixth parts of the army corps would by no means be fully assembled for the attack on August 26th early. In particular, cavalry, artillery, and the also indispensable ammunition columns, even the light ones, would be missing. General v. Fran\u00e7ois therefore believed he could not take responsibility for leading his army corps against the enemy in such an unfinished state, especially as the troops were exhausted by the previous heavy battles, the arduous retreat, and the strenuous train journey. General v. Fran\u00e7ois did not want to lead the attack frontally on Usdau, but rather sweeping south, perhaps over Gro\u00df-Lauereie against the enemy's flank. With the attack direction proposed by General Ludendorff, as he emphasized, parts of the enemy would always remain in their own right flank. They would hinder the advance on Neidenburg.\nGiven the overall situation, the army high command considered it impossible to comply with these noteworthy objections of the commanding general. It was of the opinion that consideration for the XX. Army Corps and the threat from the Niemen Army did not allow the slightest delay. It had to be attacked early on August 26th, and everything should be done to make the I. Army Corps as strong as possible by then. An attempt should be made to accelerate the arrival of the transports, the XX. Army Corps was to support the attack with a detachment from the north on Usdau and later received instructions to assist the I. Army Corps by providing cavalry and light ammunition columns. But even the maneuver intended by General v. Fran\u00e7ois over Gro\u00df-Lauereie was rejected by the high command: For this, the I. Army Corps would have had to move south on August 26th, and its attack could not have begun before August 27th. Meanwhile, the XX. Army Corps would have stood alone against the overwhelming enemy without any prospect of support. At the same time, the army's front extension would have become so large that success could also be questioned. Time and space seemed to forbid following General v. Fran\u00e7ois's plan. The commander-in-chief and his chief of staff agreed that the attack should remain on Usdau early on August 26th. General v. Hindenburg took full responsibility for this decision for the early deployment of the I. Army Corps as well as for its attack direction.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "140": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die Brigade lag jetzt bei Lautenburg.\" This is a complete sentence with a period at the end, indicating it is not a fragment.

Scholtz. Since the expected enemy attack had not yet occurred, General v. Scholtz viewed the situation with confidence. He and his chief of staff were now primarily concerned with how they could defend against the ever-expanding encirclement of their left flank to the north for several days. Since the fortress troops standing west of the Great Damerau Lake were dispensable with the advance of the I Army Corps there, and would likely have to be withdrawn from the front in the further course, General v. Scholtz wanted to replace them with the regiment provided to him from the I Army Corps and use it to extend his northern flank behind the Drewenz section north of M\u00fchlen. The 3rd Reserve Division could then be deployed as a disruptive force in the area of Reichenau. The Army High Command agreed to these shifts within the XX Army Corps, although the main focus was thereby shifted more to its left flank.\nAugust 25 passed without a battle. However, this ended the anxious time of dependency on the opponent's actions.\nThe reports received by the German High Command by evening further supplemented the picture of the situation: South of the Strasburg\u2014Lautenburg line, reconnaissance had identified only individual Russian cavalry detachments, spatially widely dispersed, some of them moving northeast. It might have been a cavalry division in total. From here, no serious threat seemed to be imminent. The previous security of the army flank by two Landwehr battalions near Strasburg had to suffice for the time being. The use of the Landwehr Division Goltz could still be reserved.\nThrough the advance of the 5th Landwehr Brigade (6 battalions, 1 squadron, 5 batteries under Lieutenant General v. M\u00fcllmann) and the I Army Corps, strong Russian cavalry had been pushed back from Lautenburg and northward into the area northwest of Soldau. In doing so, the Landwehr attacked and drove out parts of the Russian 15th Cavalry Division, which held Lautenburg. This initial success had to contribute to strengthening the confidence of the militia. The brigade was now stationed at Lautenburg.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "141": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"bereit, um den Drewenz-Abschnitt zu bilden.\" This appears to be a complete sentence as it ends with a period and expresses a complete thought.\n\n<fragment_1>bereit, um den Drewenz-Abschnitt zu bilden.</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"setzen.

The railway now brought the trains with foot troops up to Rybno, despite the threat from the numerous Russian cavalry, up to 6 km from the Russian advance troops. However, the Army Corps was still missing three battalions of infantry, almost the entire cavalry (7 squadrons out of 8), more than half of the field artillery (13 batteries out of 24), the entire heavy artillery (4 batteries), and almost all ammunition columns. Such gaps could not be fully compensated by the trains rolling in at night. For the attack on the morning of August 26, the Army Corps still had to lack essential parts. Since every hour brought more parts to the battlefield, and it was initially only about the capture of enemy positions, this had to be accepted. The attack of the I Army Corps had to begin with overcoming the Welle section. Southeast of Tautschken, the enemy stood in the hilly terrain rising towards Seeben, directly opposite. Here, too, were the only bridges between Werry and Rumian Lake over the Welle, which could otherwise be forded in the dry August of 1914. The forest terrain on the western Welle bank excluded strong artillery use by the attacker. The advance had to be in sections and then over open field against Seeben, therefore it had to be difficult in daylight, even if, as the Army High Command and General Command unanimously assumed, there was only a weakly fortified position. Therefore, the I Army Corps had to take possession of the area of Seeben by a coup de main at dawn; only then could the attack be continued against the Russian main position recognized 6 km east of Seeben on the heights of Usdau.\nAt the XX Army Corps, the intended shifts proceeded without disturbance, but some were only completed late at night. The Grenadier Regiment 1 from the I Army Corps moved into the right wing section between Rumian Lake and Great Damerau Lake after strenuous marching back and forth. South of this lake stood the 41st Infantry Division (12 battalions, 2 squadrons, 13 batteries) up to west of Logdau, followed by the 37th Infantry Division (reinforced by parts of the fortress troops to 18 battalions, 6 squadrons, 18 batteries), its left wing secured the main road east of M\u00fchlen. North of M\u00fchlen stood the 70th Landwehr Brigade and fortress troops of General v.

In front of the positions stood the cavalry of the fortress troops east of M\u00fchlen, those of the 3rd Reserve Division at Wittigwalde, a bicycle unit at Grieslienen (northeast of Hohenstein).\nOn the enemy side, various movements back and forth were observed in front of the right corps wing during the day, which could perhaps be interpreted as a relief of outposts. At the same time, according to the information available at the XX Army Corps, a strong enemy group seemed to be forming around Usdau and, spatially separated from it, another north of Neidenburg. The Russian XV Corps was supposed to have reached Waplitz only at 7:30 in the afternoon. Movements were observed at the Russian XIII Corps on both sides of Lake Lansker to the north, behind Bimaws near Kursen and eastward. It seemed as if this Russian corps wanted to move further north. This offered the prospect of defeating the Russian XXIII and XV Corps west of the lakes on August 26, before the XIII arrived.\nAt the headquarters of the German 8th Army, the upcoming events were viewed with full confidence on the evening of August 25: from the early morning of August 26, the German attack was to dictate terms to the Russians. An air report about numerous Russian military trains, which rolled in close succession to the border stations Mlawa and Illowo in the evening, did indeed recall the concerns of General v. Francois that a strong enemy would be maintained on the right flank during the attack on Usdau, but they could no longer change the decision once made. The battle had to be dared even so. The arrival of Russian reinforcements was rather another reason not to postpone the German attack under any circumstances.\nAt 8:30 in the evening, General v. Hindenburg in Riesenburg gave the attack order for August 26. It read in its essential parts: \"I Army Corps takes possession of the heights of Seeben with its left wing by 4:00 in the morning and attacks by 10:00 at the latest from Seeben and south, deeply echeloned to the right in the general direction of Usdau, Detachment M\u00fchlmann remains subordinate. \u2014 Reinforced XX Army Corps holds its positions and supports the advance of the I Army Corps by attacking with its right wing in the direction of Gro\u00df-Grieben\u2014Jankowitz.

General Samsonow, who after the battle of the 23rd/24th had the impression that the German XX Corps had moved northwest towards Osterode, and also, considering the withdrawal of the Germans from the Angerapp, wanted to hold more against the Vistula, decided to concentrate all forces at his disposal to the west and to lead the army against Allenstein\u2014Osterode (instead of as ordered against Sensburg\u2014Allenstein). For this, the VI Corps was to advance towards Allenstein. The High Command of the Army Group now approved the change in the direction of advance, but now ordered that a corps with cavalry should continue to cover at Sensburg against the lake narrows of L\u00f6tzen; finally, it also agreed with Samsonow's counterproposal to leave the VI Corps at Bischofsburg. This kept it closer to the rest of the army. However, this retention of the VI Corps and the 4th Cavalry Division meant a new weakening of the attack army. This can probably only be explained by the fact that the Army Group suspected even stronger German forces at L\u00f6tzen.\nThus, General Samsonow now had only three corps of his army at his disposal. They were to make only a small march northwards on August 25, after the previous exertions and after the battles of the XV Corps, and \u2014 as was also known to the German High Command from the intercepted radio message \u2014 reach the line Gimmendorf\u2014Kurten\u2014Paulsgut\u2014Gr.-Gavdien. However, due to a misunderstanding, the XV Corps did not carry out this short march either, but remained standing, as did the 2nd Infantry Division (from the XXIII Corps) now subordinated to it. Increasingly, the exhaustion of the troops and supply difficulties became noticeable. The XIII Corps had covered 250 km in 12 days from August 13 to 24, mostly on sandy roads, in the August heat, the XV Corps 215 km in 10 days from August 14 to 23 and then fought. The 5th Guards Infantry Division from the XXIII Corps was still behind. Under these circumstances, the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Postowski, as he had already explained to the English military attach\u00e9 present at the High Command on August 24, regarded the continuation of the march as \"an adventure\".</body>\n<footer>1) Detailed in Tichowitsch in Sbornik, Issue 3, p. 128.\nWorld War.

General Samsonov shared this view and therefore now requested, despite the urgent situation, a rest day for his army. The army group rejected the request. They did not expect a stronger opponent in front of the Narew Army and replied that a rest day could only be granted once the Allenstein\u2014Osterode line was reached, as only then would the German retreat to the Vistula be threatened.\nMeanwhile, however, the Narew Army itself gained a different picture of the enemy: General Samsonov assumed on August 25, besides the German XX Army Corps, which he suspected at Allenstein or Osterode, south of Gilgenburg the German XVII Army Corps and further west parts of the XIX Army Corps and the I Reserve Corps2), thus also forces that had fought at Gumbinnen a few days earlier. Thus, the Russian Narew Army was already reckoning with German troop movements by rail. However, regarding the course of the extensive German position, it seems, judging by the orders given, that there was complete confusion among the Russians. They were more concerned about the long-feared appearance of strong German forces near the border from Thorn.\nWhen the army group learned of the 2nd Army's assessment of the strength of the Germans, they again made the I Corps available to General Samsonov. This corps wanted to resist the advancing Germans by attack and, by shortening its right wing east of Usdau, make the southern wing as strong as possible3). General Samsonov now assigned him the 3rd Guard Infantry Division and the 1st Rifle Brigade of the XXIII Corps, which had meanwhile been freed from Nowogeorgiewsk, as well as the 6th and 15th Cavalry Divisions and some heavy artillery units. The commanding general of the I Corps, General Artamanow, was to use these 3\u00bd infantry and 2 cavalry divisions to halt the expected German thrust against the flank of the army at all costs.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>vallerie-Divisionen den gegen die Flanke der Armee erwarteten deutschen Sto\u00df um jeden Preis zum Stehen bringen.</fragment_2>", "147": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Das XIII.

The XX Army Corps was to join this attack, starting from the right wing.\nThe Army High Command received a report from the I Army Corps at 5:30 a.m. that the attack was underway, albeit with insufficient forces; General v.

These orders\ncorresponded to the army order, but given the\ntime found at the 1st Infantry Division, they were only feasible\nif everything was prepared to ensure the timely deployment of the troops\nfor the early attack. Nothing had happened here.\nGeneral v. Fran\u00e7ois was still of the opinion that his army\ncorps was not yet in a position to attack on the morning of August 26th.\nThe damage that a delay could cause seemed\ninsignificant to him compared to the risk of a hasty advance.\nHe was reinforced in this view by the fact that the\nchief of staff of the XX Army Corps, Colonel Hell, replied to an inquiry\nat night that the situation of the XX Army Corps did not justify a\nhasty attack.\nAt the 1st Infantry Division, the night corps order was received\nby telephone at 12:30 a.m. However, there were\nsuch significant frictions and delays in transmission and execution\nthat the beginnings of the division finally reached the\nWelle section at Lautschen and Juskity only at 9 a.m.\nDue to the inactivity of the Russian advance troops, the deployment\nwas achieved here without losses. The division commander, Lieutenant General v. Conta,\nwanted to conduct the attack over open field in broad daylight only after\nsufficient artillery preparation. In total, he had only\nfour batteries available so far. The division was also initially completely on its own,\nas the 2nd Infantry Division could, according to the\ncorps order, be at Gro\u00df-Roschlau at the earliest at 10 a.m.\nThus, Lieutenant General v.

Fran\u00e7ois, who arrived shortly after 8 a.m.\nin the front line east of Lautschen at the staff of the\n1st Infantry Division, agreed with the intention of the division commander.\nHowever, this also meant that the attack on Usdau had to be postponed.\nGeneral v.

Francois received this order, he surprised the Army High Command by reporting that not even Seeben and Gro\u00df-Koschlau were in his possession. Thus, the attack on Usdau had to be postponed even further.\nMeanwhile, General v. Francois had decided to comply with the urging of the Army High Command and to launch the attack on Usdau at 1:00 p.m. His order began with the words: \"By order of the Army High Command, the attack is to be carried out with the forces currently available.\" The 5th Landwehr Brigade, which had previously encountered little resistance at the Welle crossing east of Lautenburg, was to advance from Klein-Tauersee via Heinrichsdorf, and the 2nd Infantry Division was to advance over Gro\u00df-Koschlau to Gro\u00df-Tauersee. Meanwhile, the 1st Infantry Division, which had advanced over Seeben to Usdau, felt strong enough after the arrival of additional units to carry out the attack against the weakly occupied Seeben positions. After strong artillery preparation, they were taken at 12:30 p.m. The Russians (from the 1st Brigade of the 24th Infantry Division) had retreated to their main position. However, it was 3:00 p.m. before the German troops of Lieutenant General v. Conta were organized for the further attack and advanced on Usdau. There was still a distance of 9 km to cover in the attack over open field to the enemy position there. It seemed doubtful whether this attack could be completed in the few daylight hours remaining. The troops had been on the move since early morning in the scorching August heat. General v. Francois therefore decided to postpone the further attack to the next day and agreed that Lieutenant General v. Conta should order his troops at 3:45 p.m. on August 26th to advance only so far that the artillery units could begin against the Usdau main position at dawn on August 27th. Accordingly, the 2nd Infantry Division and the 5th Landwehr Brigade were also instructed by the General Command.\nOn the evening of August 26th, the 5th Landwehr Brigade was positioned around Heinrichsdorf, the 2nd Infantry Division, which had encountered little enemy resistance at several points, was positioned northward up to the Trallau station.

Hindenburg ordered, as soon as he received the report\nat 10 a.m. of the capture of Gro\u00df-Koschlaus and Seebens by the I Army\nCorps, that the XX Army Corps should now \"advance to attack\nbetween the Great Damerau Lake and M\u00fchlen Lake over the approximate\nline Ganshorn\u00b2)\u2014Thymaul with a strong right wing.\" An\nimmediate support of the I Army Corps by a partial advance of the\nXX Army Corps on Usdau seemed no longer necessary to the High Command.\nIf it became necessary later, it could be conducted more effectively\nfrom the area west of Ganshorn. While the right\nflank of the XX Army Corps attacked, the left north of the M\u00fchlen\nLake was initially to be held back, to follow later as a reserve.\nWhen this army order reached the XX Army Corps, reports were already\npresent here, according to which on both sides of the M\u00fchlen Lake, the advance of strong Russian forces against the positions of the 37th Infantry Division became noticeable.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Sees das Vorgehen starker russischer Kr\u00e4fte gegen die Stellungen der 37.

Since noon, Russian artillery \nhad been shelling the German trenches occupied by the Landwehr near M\u00fchlen. \nFurther north and at Hohenstein, no enemy had been reported so far. \nThus, the 3rd Reserve Division received the order, according to the army command \nof the evening of August 25th, to advance towards Hohenstein over the Orzewn section. Otherwise, for the \nattack of the XX Army Corps, only its southern wing was initially considered. \nGeneral v. Scholz ordered the 41st Infantry Division to attack the line \nGanshorn\u2014Gro\u00df-Gardienen, while the 37th was only to \nparticipate in the attack with its southern, 75th Infantry Brigade. When \nthis order was given to the divisions at 2:45 p.m., \nGeneral v. Scholz assumed that the I Army Corps might have reached Usdau by now. When the commander of the 41st Infantry Division, \nMajor General Sonntag, ordered his infantry to advance at 3:30 p.m. after artillery preparation, he believed Usdau was already in the possession \nof the I Army Corps. It was about the time when General v. Francois \ndecided to call off the attack west of Usdau for that day. \nThe troops of the XX Army Corps were led into attack against the enemy for the first time on August 26th. They were probably \nexhausted from the constant marches back and forth without sufficient rest and from \nthe ever-new entrenchment work of the past weeks, but otherwise fresh and confident. These active \ntroops were eager to finally be used in attack, instead of defense as before. \nAt 3:45 p.m., the right wing of the 41st Infantry \nDivision \u2014 74th Infantry Brigade under Major General Rei\u00dfer \u2014 \nadvanced from Heseelicht towards Ganshorn, and by evening had reached this target in uninterrupted advance. Further north, the 72nd Infantry \nBrigade under Major General Schaer had joined the advance. Almost \nwithout firing, but also with not insignificant own losses \n(about 1200 men), the brave infantry of the 41st Division had partially broken the \nenemy resistance in bayonet combat. The \nenemy, however, as we know today, was not too strong. \nThe western column, the 2nd Brigade of the Russian 2nd Infantry Division, had caught them in the flank as they wanted to march north from Lippau east \npast Gardienen. The Russian \nartillery had barely started firing; the entire Russian brigade, \nof which the 7th Regiment alone is said to have lost over 2800 men, was, severely shaken, retreating south of the Rownatten Lake by evening.</body>\n<footer>1) Tschowitsch in Sbornik, Issue 3, p. 134.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>war, schwer ersch\u00fcttert, abends im Zur\u00fcckfluten s\u00fcdlich des Rownatten-Sees.</fragment_2>", "153": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Da\u00df\".

The Russian divisional commander withdrew the brigade behind the Kownatten Lake at nightfall in view of the defeat of his western column. Thus, the Russian attack south of M\u00fchlen Lake failed; north of the lake, it was apparently attempted only by a regiment of the 6th Infantry Division with a battery and was easily repelled on both sides.\nThe troops of the German 41st and 37th Infantry Divisions rested in the evening, feeling the first victory but also heavily exhausted, with rifles in arms in the line Ganshorn\u2014Faulen\u2014M\u00fchlen. At the XX Army Corps headquarters, it was believed that the entire Russian XXIII Corps had been defeated south of M\u00fchlen Lake. The fact that an 8 km wide gap in the German front gaped from Ganshorn to Wansen due to the detachment of the I Army Corps was initially not recognized, but given the victory of the 41st Infantry Division, it also had no serious significance.\nOn the northern wing of the XX Army Corps, the commander of the 3rd Reserve Division, Lieutenant General v. Morgen, when he received the order to advance on Hohenstein on the afternoon of August 26, had the impression that his advance would lead to a pure frontal battle, during which the expected Russian XIII Corps could come into his flank from further north. He therefore decided, on his own responsibility, to wait at Reichenau until the enemy turned against the XX Army Corps and attacked. He expected to be able to strike into the flank of this enemy early on August 27. General Morgen did not initially report this deviation from the order to the General Command. Had he carried out the order given to him, it might have come to a battle against the northern wing of the Russian XV Corps at Hohenstein on the 26th, or at the latest in the early morning of August 27. Since the Russian XIII Corps was at this time east of the lake near Stabigotten, Dartzen, and south of Allenstein, it would have been impossible to successfully carry out the attack intended by the Army High Command west of the lakes. That the 3rd Reserve Division had remained stationary was only learned by the General Command of the XX Army Corps on the evening of August 26, and by the Army High Command only after issuing the orders for the following day.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>3.

On the evening of that day, the High Command was there, despite sufficient telephone connections to the general commands and despite the dispatch of intelligence officers, but was only incompletely informed about the situation at the front. However, it was already clear: The day's results were far from what the Army High Command had intended and ordered for August 26. The I Army Corps had only set out late. The fact that the attack on Usdau had not even begun was a severe disappointment; the attack of the XX Army Corps had only gained momentum on the extreme right flank.\nThe following reports were available in detail: In the rear of the I Army Corps, strong parts of the Russian 15th Cavalry Division had again tried to advance north between Strasburg and Soldau; however, no new enemy was detected here. A battalion of the Landwehr Regiment 19 (20th Landwehr Brigade) and the armored train of the Hohenzollern Fortress had to evade, to restore order here, because the attack of the I Army Corps should not be weakened by detachments for secondary purposes. The corps was now fully assembled with its fighting troops. However, the main task for August 27 was still ahead. It had become even more difficult due to the reported arrival of Russian reinforcements from Mlawa during the day, than it already was. In the morning, aircraft had detected a reinforced infantry brigade near Soldau, a regiment near Mlawa, and also 12 to 14 trains. According to intercepted radio messages, the Russian I Corps had been reinforced during the day by guard regiments, perhaps from the 3rd Guard Infantry Division belonging to the Russian XXIII Corps, or perhaps from the Russian Guard Corps itself, which, previously assumed to be with the Njemen Army, was now supposed to have turned from Vilna to Warsaw according to intelligence reports. Thus, the Army High Command had the impression in the evening that a strong Russian group, which was continuously receiving reinforcements from the south, was positioned around Borchersdorf and approximately one division at Usdau, this in a prepared position.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>her dauernd weitere Verst\u00e4rkungen zuflossen, um Borchersdorf stehe und etwa eine Division bei Usdau, diese in vorbereiteter Stellung.</fragment_2>", "155": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"General v.

How far the attack of the German XX Army Corps had advanced against them was not known. Nothing was yet known about the Russian attempt to attack at M\u00fchlen, and it was believed that the 3rd Reserve Division was at Hohenstein. This wing was now also to be reinforced by the Landwehr Division Goltz, as had already been ordered during the day. Their first movements were expected on August 27 in Osterode.\nEast of the lakes, the Russian XIII Corps was assumed to be marching from Kurken and eastward towards Allenstein.\nFrom the German eastern group, it was known that the XVII Army Corps and the I Reserve Corps were south of Bischofsstein in a hitherto favorable battle against the Russian VI Corps coming from Ortelsburg. On the other hand, the Russian Njemen Army had reached Drengfurth and Gerdauen behind the German eastern group with its southern wing.\nBased on this assessment of the situation, the army order for August 27 was issued at 9 PM. Since the goal set by the army high command on August 26 had by no means been reached, an attack was to be launched on the entire front on August 27 at 4 AM with the greatest energy. From this day, the decision was expected; it was again to be sought against the Russian center, XXIII and XV Corps, before the Russian XIII Corps, assumed to be east of the lakes, could bring help to them. At the same time, the retreat to the south was to be relocated for these two corps, as planned from the beginning. For this, Usdau had to be taken above all.\nAccordingly, General v. Fran\u00e7ois received the order to attack strongly staggered to the right on Usdau on August 27. To secure a quick success here, the XX Army Corps was to support this attack directly from the north. \"After the capture of Usdau,\" it continued, \"it is important that the enemy be rolled up against the XX Army Corps from Usdau. For this, it is necessary that the I Army Corps also advance on Neidenburg with the strongest possible forces. Furthermore, the reinforced I Army Corps is responsible for flank protection against Borchersdorf.\"\nGeneral v.

Given the difficult situation at the front and the imminent approach of the Njemen Army, the general attack seemed to them the only salvation. By waiting for the 3rd Reserve Division, they seemed to have lost valuable time, likely missing a favorable opportunity.\nThe commanding general of the XX Army Corps, General of Artillery v. Scholtz, and his chief of staff, Colonel Hell, viewed the situation differently. After the enemy had occupied Hohenstein from the east on August 26, as reported to the General Command, and cavalry had advanced further north from Stabigotten via Wemitten to the west, they no longer considered an attack by the 3rd Reserve Division feasible. They rather expected that the Russian XXIII Corps had already turned west and anticipated the attack from two Russian corps at M\u00fchlen and northwards on August 27. German troops at M\u00fchlen consisted of the extreme left wing of the 37th Infantry Division, but north of that, only fortress troops remained, which were very weak in artillery. If the enemy succeeded here, the main forces of the XX Army Corps, attacking south of the eastward-stretched M\u00fchlen Lake, could initially bring no help and were themselves seriously threatened in flank and rear. Additionally, they had to be weakened by the ordered detachments to support the attack on Usdau. The forces seemed insufficient for a simultaneous attack in the north. Such considerations made it seem more correct to them to remain on the northern flank in defense, but to shift the bulk of the troops further south to attack south of the M\u00fchlen Lake with strong force. The 3rd Reserve Division was to move south behind the Drewenz to Klein-P\u00f6tzbruch to secure the flank of the general attack.\nOnly reluctantly did the Army High Command agree to this interpretation of the XX Army Corps.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>fassung des XX.

Army Corps wanted to concentrate all its strength against Usdau, while the 5th Landwehr Brigade and the southern flank of the 2nd Infantry Division were initially to remain in defense. Against Usdau, the bulk of the 2nd and the 1st Infantry Division were positioned from the southwest and northwest. At 4 a.m., the artillery was to open fire, and at 5 a.m., the infantry was to advance. The XX Army Corps wanted to support the attack from the north, from Bergling, through a mixed detachment under Lieutenant General v. Schmettau.\nHowever, the attack did not start as early as ordered on August 27th. While the preparation and opening of fire by the 2nd Infantry Division, which Lieutenant General v. Falt had moved closer to the enemy in the dark, proceeded punctually, the artillery of the 1st Infantry Division experienced significant delays. These were partly due to the fact that almost half of the batteries only arrived at the division after dark on August 26th. The delay was even greater with the detachment v. Schmettau of the XX Army Corps, which had to be newly formed during the night from individual battalions of the 41st and 37th Infantry Divisions (a total of 6 battalions, 2 squadrons, 2 batteries). It was 6 a.m. before they were assembled east of Bergling.\nThe Russians responded to the German artillery fire lively since 4 a.m., but soon after, Russian riflemen and columns were observed retreating from Usdau to the east by the cavalry of the 41st Infantry Division skirting east of Usdau. The German troops attacking this place initially learned nothing of this. Their infantry pushed the Russian advance troops further back in a wide-ranging attack, while the German artillery fire continued to lay with undiminished intensity on the Russian positions at the railway cut south of Usdau and on the place itself. Thus, the storming German infantry finally encountered only slight resistance when they entered the burning place from the west and north at 11 a.m. 200 prisoners from the Russian Infantry Regiment 85 still fell into their hands. \u2014 As soon as General v. Fran\u00e7ois received the news of the capture of Usdau, he instructed the 1st Infantry Division to advance on Neidenburg.\nWhile the fate of Usdau was being sealed, the Russian southern flank (2 regiments of the 22nd Infantry Division), perhaps with the deployment of newly arrived reinforcements (parts of the 3rd Guard Infantry Division and 1st Rifle Brigade), launched an attack.

Due to the first erroneous report about the \ncapture of Usdau, the Landwehr Brigade had already been deployed early \nin the morning at Borchersdorf by the General Command. At the same \ntime, the 2nd Infantry Division had received orders not to wait any longer \nbut to accelerate their attack. Thus, the German attack collided with the \nRussian one and was partially hit in the flank. This led to a particularly \nfierce battle on the southern flank of the German I Army Corps.\nThe 5th Landwehr Brigade under Lieutenant General v. M\u00fcllmann \nhad set out with the two Pomeranian Landwehr Regiments 2 and 9 \nfrom Heinrichsdorf via Ruttkowiz to attack Sturpjlen. West of this place, \ntheir advance came to a halt under considerable losses, especially among \nofficers, in Russian infantry and artillery fire, while the brigade was \nsimultaneously harassed from the south by strong Russian cavalry. Their \nsituation seemed to become serious when simultaneously a setback \noccurred north of them at the 2nd Infantry Division.\nLieutenant General v. Fall, the commander of the 2nd Infantry \nDivision, had the infantry of his left wing (4 battalions of the \n4th Brigade) advance in the morning with the left shoulder on the main \nroad to Usdau. However, this attack soon stalled in the heavy enemy \ndefensive fire. South of the 4th Infantry Brigade, the 3rd Infantry Brigade, \nreinforced to 8 battalions under Major General Mengelbier, staggered to \nthe right, took the direction from the area north of Heinrichsdorf towards \nGro\u00df-Tauersee. The Russian thrust hit this advance right in the flank. It \nwas supported by effective fire from concealed batteries. Thus, the riflemen \nof the German 3rd Infantry Brigade only reached 2 km southwest of Gro\u00df- \nTauersee, on their southern flank, 2 assigned battalions of the Infantry \nRegiment 45 were withdrawn by the enemy attack in the direction of \nSturpjlen and then joined the 5th Landwehr Brigade.\nTo assist the heavily struggling German infantry, the commander \nof the 2nd Lithuanian Field Artillery Regiment No. 37, Lieutenant Colonel \nv. der Lippe, advanced his batteries close behind and into the rifle line, \nbut could no longer prevent their gradual crumbling. They were finally \nwithdrawn under the cover of artillery to the forest edges east and north of Heinrichsdorf.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Sch\u00fctze der Artillerie an die Waldr\u00e4nder \u00f6stlich und n\u00f6rdlich Heinrichsdorf zur\u00fcckgenommen.</fragment_2>", "160": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"So wurde dem General v.

Conta, after capturing Usdau, immediately began pursuing the enemy retreating along the main road to Soldau and turned against the parts of the Russian front still holding east of Usdau. Further east, the detachment v. Schmettau advanced.\nThe events at the 2nd Infantry Division reached the General Command in exaggerated form. At the same time, Lieutenant General v. M\u00fcllmann requested support. Additionally, Russian radio messages were intercepted, prompting General v. Fran\u00e7ois to consider deploying the 3rd (Warsaw) Guard Infantry Division, perhaps even the entire XXIII Corps, against the front of his army corps. Aerial reconnaissance had also detected \"apparently an infantry brigade\" at Soldau that morning, with about twelve trains at the Illowo and Malwa stations, as well as the arrival of another train from Zichanow. Under these circumstances, General v. Fran\u00e7ois no longer considered it possible to carry out the attack on Neidenburg before dealing with the Soldau enemy. He reported to the Army High Command at 11:20 a.m. that the I Army Corps, considering the situation on its right flank and at Soldau, had turned south and southeast to continue the attack in that direction.\nThis fact had to be accepted by the High Command. It was easier to do so, as it was now known that the enemy had already moved far eastward from the southern flank of the XX Army Corps during the night and that the German Eastern Group (XVII Army Corps and I Reserve Corps) had achieved a victory north of Bischofsburg on August 26th, which would likely enable their cooperation against the enemy of the XX Army Corps by the 28th.

The advance of the German 1st Infantry Division, on the other hand, pushed the 2nd Infantry Division out of the front, but then came to a halt before Russian reception positions, which extended north of Borchersdorf from Nio\u00dfyn to Klenzau. Lieutenant General v. Conti immediately set his troops to a new attack. The Russian retreat had to be dammed at the breaches near Soldau. There, the fruits of the fierce battle were to be harvested. However, continuing the attack to that point would have required further, perhaps hard, battles. It was the third heavy day of fighting after Stallup\u00f6nen and Gumbinnen, which the brave East Prussians had victoriously endured. The forces were exhausted after the great day's effort. Thus, General v. Fran\u00e7ois set the goal in an order given at 3:45 p.m., \"to gain a position from which we can hinder the retreat over Soldau.\" The cavalry of the 1st Infantry Division and the detachment v. Smettau were to unite behind the left wing of this detachment and be ready for pursuit.\nThe enemy had retreated south of Soldau before the German attack, only rearguards still held north of the place. The retreat is attributed by the Russians to the effect of the German artillery fire and is otherwise due to the at least indecisive command of General Artamanow. Behind the retreating enemy, the German 5th Landwehr Brigade reached Hohendorf in the evening with the foremost parts. The 1st Infantry Division came up to 1 km south of Borchersdorf, the detachment v. Smettau up to south of Klenzau and to Sch\u00f6nwiese; behind their eastern flank, 6 squadrons were united at Gro\u00df-Schl\u00e4fken.

At Illowo apparently greater congestion or unchanged bivouac setup. Seven aircraft about to depart. Between Illowo and Mlawa few troops, who, as far as can be seen, are also retreating.\" \u2014 Unaware of these circumstances, General v. Fran\u00e7ois ordered for the morning of August 28th that with daylight 6 heavy field howitzer batteries and 15 light batteries under the unified command of the commander of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade, Major General Moewes, should combat the Russian batteries identified at Soldau and that the entire infantry of the corps should be ready to attack at 6:00 in the morning.\nGeneral of Artillery v. Scholz had ordered the continuation of the attack south of Lake M\u00fchlen for 4:00 in the morning on August 27th. However, the XX Army Corps felt left in the lurch by the I Army Corps remaining behind on August 26th and therefore considered caution necessary. It also seems that an oral instruction from the High Command, which Major General Gr\u00fcner had delivered to General v. Scholz on the morning of August 26th, had an effect. According to this, the XX Army Corps was then supposed to \"not storm the front, but wait for the arrival of the I Army Corps.\" Thus, the phrase \"with greatest energy\" included in the army order by the Army High Command found no real resonance in the order of the XX Army Corps. Rather, the 41st Infantry Division had received the order to attack \"in accordance\" with the I Army Corps reinforced by the v. Schmettau detachment; the attack of the 37th Infantry Division was to be supported by parts of the 20th Landwehr Brigade (under the Unger detachment) and by the 70th Landwehr Brigade. North of Lake M\u00fchlen, the Drewenz section was to be held by the rest of the fortress troops, the 3rd Reserve Division from Reichenau was to move to the left corps wing to Klein-R\u00f6hrsdorf.

The situation of the 37th Infantry Division was unknown, but cannon fire echoed from Usdau behind their own division. Major General Sonntag anticipated the necessity of assisting there or with the 37th Division. Therefore, he initially did not continue the forward movement and reported this to the General Command, which agreed with the decision.\nThe attack also did not progress well with the 37th Infantry Division. Concerns about a Russian breakthrough at M\u00fchlen had resurfaced. However, the General Command, based on the previous day's experiences, was not entirely sure whether the 3rd Reserve Division would carry out the order to advance to Klein-P\u00f6tzdorf. It initially seemed necessary to withdraw the parts of the 37th Division previously deployed at M\u00fchlen and the 70th Landwehr Brigade, which was designated to support their attack. For the attack south of the lake, the 37th Division, including the 20th Landwehr Brigade, still had about 20 battalions and corresponding artillery available, despite the transfer of 4 battalions to the Schmettau detachment. The division commander, Lieutenant General v. Staabs, however, insisted, considering the situation at M\u00fchlen, only on the attack of his southern, 75th Infantry Brigade. He suggested to the 73rd Infantry Brigade, still in the old defensive position north of the Laubener Lake, \"to consider whether a bold undertaking on Thymau might be very promising.\" \u2014 The attack of the 75th Brigade was delayed due to late order transmission. The brigade reached the Konti-See\u2014Seythen line almost without combat by 9 a.m. and opened fire on Russian positions at Januschkau. The 73rd Brigade reached Thymau without combat.\nIn fact, the 41st and 37th Infantry Divisions east of the Rowantken Lake at Stottau and Januschkau faced only the remnants of the Russian 2nd Infantry Division, which had been defeated the previous day, under Lieutenant General Mingin. The Russian troops had no combat strength left.

The other brigade of the Russian division attempted to initially respond to the German artillery fire at Januschkau, but soon felt threatened on its southern flank and by the appearance of German cavalry in its rear, and thus retreated eastward on the order of the division commander.\nDuring these events south of Lake M\u00fchlen, the Russian attack expected by General v. Scholz with some concern was preparing to the north:\nThe German defensive position extended here from the northwest end of Lake M\u00fchlen behind the Drewenz valley, which is up to 40 m deep and largely forested, towards north-northwest. A series of smaller lakes provided some protection to the southern part of the position. On the other hand, the large forests in front of the line, especially the Jablonken forest in the north, obstructed visibility and offered the enemy the possibility of concealed deployment and approach. Thus, defending the extensive section was no easy task. Since 4 a.m., Russian fire had been on the German positions at M\u00fchlen, soon extending northward. A further shift of forces from the XX Army Corps to the south, to the attack wing, was thus called into question, and the 3rd Reserve Division had meanwhile arrived at Klein-Piasken and Kirsteinsdorf. The Russian fire eventually also spread to the front of this division. An enemy radio message that became known at the army high command confirmed the attack intention of the Russian XV Corps on M\u00fchlen.\nGeneral v. Scholz, despite this threat to his front, had not abandoned the idea of an attack south of Lake M\u00fchlen. He had already directed the 37th Infantry Division at 8:30 a.m. towards the southern end of this lake, towards Waplitz, into the rear of the attacking enemy. However, the execution was delayed because the division, which had reached the area north of Lake Konti by 9 a.m., took a one-and-a-half-hour rest there. \u2014 Meanwhile, the 41st Infantry Division had prepared an advance into the rear of the Usdau enemy. The execution was halted when at 10:30 a.m. it became known to the division commander that the enemy had been observed retreating southeast from Usdau since about 7 a.m.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 159.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "165": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Es waren auch um die gerade eintreffende Oberquartiermeister des Armee-Oberkommandos.\"\nThis sentence appears incomplete as it ends abruptly without a clear conclusion or punctuation.\n\n<fragment_1>Es waren auch um die gerade eintreffende Oberquartiermeister des Armee-Oberkommandos.</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"mandos, Generalmajor Gr\u00fcnert, zutreffend bedeutete, die \u201eTr\u00fcmmer\" der am Tage vorher geschlagenen Russen.\"\nThis sentence seems to continue the thought from `fragment_1`, as it starts mid-sentence and appears to complete the idea introduced in `fragment_1`.\n\n<fragment_2>mandos, Generalmajor Gr\u00fcnert, zutreffend bedeutete, die \u201eTr\u00fcmmer\" der am Tage vorher geschlagenen Russen.</fragment_2>\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` ends without proper punctuation, suggesting it is incomplete.\n- `fragment_2` begins with \"mandos,\" which seems to be a continuation of the previous sentence, likely referring to the \"Oberquartiermeister des Armee-Oberkommandos\" mentioned in `fragment_1`.\n- Combining them forms a coherent sentence: \"Es waren auch um die gerade eintreffende Oberquartiermeister des Armee-Oberkommandos, Generalmajor Gr\u00fcnert, zutreffend bedeutete, die \u201eTr\u00fcmmer\" der am Tage vorher geschlagenen Russen.\"\n\n<decision>The fragments align and form a coherent sentence.</decision>\n</thinking>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>166</pageno>\n<header>The Victory over the Flanks of the Narew Army.</header>\n<body>As far as can be determined today, the Army High Command was continuously informed about the situation and intentions of the XX Army Corps on the morning of August 27. The waiting behavior of the corps did not correspond to the views and wishes of the High Command, but it did not overlook the situation of the corps in detail to the extent that intervention seemed justified. At that time, it was still generally accepted in peacetime to issue orders but to leave the execution to the subordinates. Only in extreme emergencies, especially at higher command levels, was intervention considered permissible. Thus, the decision of the 41st Infantry Division to advance into the rear of the Usdau enemy was ultimately approved. Any action was better than further inactive waiting.\nHowever, when the decision was made shortly after 11 a.m. with the capture of Usdau at this point, there could no longer be any doubt that General v. Scholtz had to attack on his southern flank not only with the 37th Infantry Division but with full force to come into the flank and rear of the M\u00fchlen enemy. Thus, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg ordered at 11 a.m., simultaneously with the order for the withdrawal of the I Army Corps to the south: \"XX Army Corps swings east of Lake Kowranten to the north to block the enemy's path to the south here.\"\nJust as General v. Scholtz received this army order, which was to initiate the attack on his southern flank, he also received reports of a Russian breakthrough at M\u00fchlen. German infantry and artillery retreated north of M\u00fchlen. Significant local reserves were no longer available. The extent and impact of the breakthrough appeared so threatening that, in addition to half of the 3rd Reserve Division, the 37th Infantry Division was also called from its promising attack direction to counterattack against the flank of the enemy breakthrough.\nThus, the 41st Infantry Division remained solely available for the attack ordered by the Army High Command. At 12:15 p.m., its commander, Major General Sontag, received the order to march immediately on Waplitz. He had only 9 battalions at his disposal, with which he set out at 1:30 p.m. westward around Lake Kowranten. He was concerned about the enemy reported in the flank of his advance near Frantanu and Bujaken. It was also about the just arriving quartermaster of the Army High Command, Major General Gr\u00fcnert, who correctly identified the \"remnants\" of the Russians defeated the day before.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>mandos, Generalmajor Gr\u00fcnert, zutreffend bedeutete, die \u201eTr\u00fcmmer\" der am Tage vorher geschlagenen Russen.</fragment_2>", "166": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Kalwa (Geh\u00f6ft 2 km s\u00fcdlich Reichenau) im R\u00fccken\".

However, these were assumed to be the entire XXIII Corps. It was an oppressively hot afternoon, the roads were deeply sandy, and the troops had not yet been supplied. Thus, they had to rest again for a longer period at Thorweken. Then Major General Sontag decided, considering the small strength of his division and the enemy at Frankenau, not to cross the line Januschkau\u2014Sabipi\u00dfe of the M\u00fchlen Lake on this day. A corps order given at 6 o'clock in the evening at the urging of the High Command, \"to advance beyond Warli\u00df today with all available force,\" could not be executed for the same reason, as well as due to the advanced time of day. \u2014 Thus, the attack of the XX Army Corps was definitively halted for August 27th.\nMeanwhile, it had become apparent that the news of the enemy breakthrough at M\u00fchlen was false or at least exaggerated. In fact, only a small Russian detachment had advanced as far as M\u00fchlen railway station. But movements of German reserves in this area, perhaps also some retrograde movements behind the front, had given rise to the rumor of a breakthrough. A telephone officer had passed it on as fact. \u2014 The general Russian infantry attack at and north of M\u00fchlen actually only began around 4 o'clock in the afternoon. It collapsed everywhere under German defensive fire. Towards evening, the Russians lying close to the German front surrendered in large numbers. The brave West Prussians (Landwehr Regiment 5 and replacement battalions of the deputy 69th Infantry Brigade) took 1,000 prisoners from both divisions of the Russian XV Corps.\nAlthough the Russian pressure against the Drewenz front decreased as a result, General v. Scholtz continued to view the area around M\u00fchlen with concern as a particularly vulnerable point. At the same time, an enemy envelopment became noticeable in the north. Already in the early afternoon hours, there were reports about further outflanking movements by the enemy. Among other things, the approach of a Russian column of all arms was reported via Gilgenau (6 km northwest of Hohenstein)\u2014Wittignwalde, far outflanking the 3rd Reserve Division. Radio messages from the Russian XIII Corps seemed to confirm the previous assumption that this corps had turned westward. Kalwa (farm 2 km south of Reichenau) in the rear of the 3rd Reserve Division was to be the target of its attack.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>der 3.

Although the unloading of the German Landwehr Division east of Osterode and Biesfellen had been underway since the morning, no reliable support seemed forthcoming. Thus, General v. Scholtz decided to use part of the 37th Infantry Division to support the M\u00fchlen position, but to move the bulk of this division to defend behind the left flank of the 3rd Reserve Division. The execution of this movement was postponed to the early morning hours of August 28, with the entire division remaining west of M\u00fchlen overnight.\nThe assumption that the Russian XIII Corps had swung against the northern flank of General v. Scholtz seemed to be confirmed again in the evening. At the 3rd Reserve Division, which had only had to fend off lighter Russian attacks from Ordnitz in the morning, the enemy also probed through the Jablonken Forest in the afternoon and appeared in the evening with riflemen on the heights east of Reichenau. The 3rd Reserve Division was ready for battle with 4\u00bd battalions at the Drewenz section, 7\u00bd battalions had timely bent back along the Kirsteinsdorf\u2014Geierswalde road to face Reichenau.\nThus, by the evening of August 27, victory had only been achieved at the German I Army Corps. The XX Army Corps, with the sole exception of the 41st Infantry Division, was in defense against an assumed superior enemy, whose southern flank at M\u00fchlen had already suffered significantly.

It did not happen, as the Russian VI Corps on August 25th had already stopped at Rothflie\u00df (6 km north of Bischofsburg). This corps had the task of covering the right flank of the Narew Army at Bischofsburg. The 4th Cavalry Division in Sensburg was subordinated to the corps.\nThe German I Reserve Corps under Lieutenant General v. Below had completed a strenuous 30 km march by the evening of August 25th. As refugee crowds blocked the main roads, the troops had to divert to side roads. The corps, heavily fatigued, moved to rest in a broad front with both divisions one behind the other at Seeburg. The 6th Landwehr Brigade had moved up to it from the east as far as Lautern. \u2014 The XVII Army Corps under General of Cavalry v. Mackensen had an even harder time. To relieve the enemy, a particularly large marching effort had to be demanded from the group. Closer to the broad front of the advancing Russian Niemen Army, the stream of fleeing local inhabitants was even more noticeable than with the I Reserve Corps. With women and children, with belongings, wagons, and cattle, these unfortunate people, coming from the east, crossed the southward march of the corps. To keep it flowing, even harsh measures against their own nationals could not be avoided. Thus, the 36th Infantry Division marched from Friedland via Schippenbeil to the beginning at Bischofstein, which it only reached late after a 50 km march in the sweltering August heat. Behind it came the 35th Infantry Division, taking a more westerly route, via Bartenstein to the beginning at Gro\u00df Schwansfeld. The efforts of this division, which had to cover a few more kilometers than the 36th Infantry Division, and also on poor sandy roads to Bartenstein, taxed the troops to the utmost. But the news that it was no longer retreating, but advancing against another enemy, always gave new strength.\nThe completely exhausted 1st Cavalry Division, tasked with covering and concealing the departure, sought to reach the target ordered by the army high command, Gerdaunen west of the Omulef course via Allenburg, but was held up there by refugee columns and finally stopped 12 km west of Gerdaunen. Thus, it could hardly fulfill its task here on the northern flank of the German Eastern Group.

Colonel General v. Hindenburg therefore temporarily intended to leave not only the 1st Cavalry Division but also the rear Infantry Division of the XVII Army Corps under the joint command of General v.

However, as this army continued to remain far away, he decided in the course of the afternoon that both corps of the Eastern Group should advance with full force against the enemy stationed at Bischofsburg on August 26\u00b2). The 1st Cavalry Division remained alone against Rennenkampf's entire army.\nDuring the course of the day, the general commands of both corps had also made contact with each other to coordinate joint action for August 26.

The boldness of the Army High Command, which had also deployed the last infantry division to the south for a decisive action, was all the more admired.\nOn August 25, the Russian 4th Cavalry Division reported the march of stronger German forces through Rastenburg to the west. General Blagowieschtschenski, with his VI Corps, was positioned against these forces on the night of August 25/26 at Rothflie\u00df (4th Infantry Division) and Bischofsburg (16th Infantry Division). A reconnaissance to the north was not indicated, so the next advance of the German XVII Army Corps remained hidden from the Russians. According to an order from General Samonow, General Blagowieschtschenski was to advance towards Allenstein on August 26 under cover against Rastenburg to join the army.\nIn the early morning hours of August 26, the German 6th Landwehr Brigade was marching north of the Great Lautern Lake to the west, while the vanguard of the German XVII Army Corps, crossing the marching column of the Landwehr Brigade, marched directly onto the northern flank of the Russian Corps' security. The first reports about the enemy were received by General v. Mackensen from the commander of the 6th Landwehr Brigade, Major General Krahmer, whom he met in Lautern. The leading 36th Infantry Division of his Army Corps had set out from Bischofstein after a short night's rest on August 26 and intended to take a march break at Lautern.

Finally, at Gro\u00df-B\u00f6ssiau, the commander of the 36th Reserve Division, \nMajor General Kr\u00fcger, attacked with the majority of his division and the \n6th Landwehr Brigade. The 69th Reserve Brigade under Major General \nv. Homeyer and the 6th Landwehr Brigade under Major General Krahmer \nbore the main work of the day. At Klein-B\u00f6ssiau, the enemy, with the \nlake at their back, resisted to the utmost. In a heroic but particularly \nofficer-heavy costly assault, the Pomeranian Landwehr Regiments 34 and \n49 took the village in the evening. Several hundred prisoners and some \nguns were their spoils.\nMeanwhile, the beginnings of the 1st Reserve Division at the southern \nend of the Daden Lake had also repelled weaker enemy forces advancing \nfrom the east. It was the beginning of the Russian 16th Infantry Division, \nwhich, according to the army order, had been set in motion by General \nBlagowjeschtschenski towards Wartenburg\u2014Allenstein before knowing the \nsituation at Gro\u00df-B\u00f6ssiau, but later turned north.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "172": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Teile von ihm waren am 26.

At the same time, its front facing the German XVII Army Corps suffered heavily under the unified fire of 88 German guns directed by the commander of the German 36th Field Artillery Brigade, Major General Handorff. Thus, the Russians began to retreat east of the lakes from 4 p.m.1), perhaps even a little earlier, along the entire line. The late infantry attack by the 36th Infantry Division of the XVII Army Corps encountered abandoned enemy positions. Therefore, the day's spoils primarily fell to the I Reserve Corps, which captured 1,700 prisoners, 8 machine guns, and 30 guns. The Russians report their losses as 5,300 men, 18 machine guns, but only 16 guns. Under the impression of the defeat of his 4th Infantry Division, General Blagoweschtschenski abandoned the march on Allenstein and retreated south with his entire corps via Bischofsburg. Whether the 4th Cavalry Division was involved in the fighting is not clearly known.\nOn the night of August 27, the German I Reserve Corps was positioned with a division each at Wartenburg and north of Lake Daey, while the XVII Army Corps with both divisions was side by side east of Gro\u00df-B\u00f6ssau. They rejoiced in the victory but still had the impression that the enemy had managed to evade the major blow planned against him in time, and therefore anticipated renewed serious combat on August 27 against an enemy reinforced by forces reported further south. They prepared to attack an extensive position east of Bischofsburg, which, according to an aerial report from Raschgun (9 km south of Bischofsburg), extended to Sroquitten. General von Mackensen wanted to engage at the front, while Lieutenant General von Below turned again to the western flank.\nMeanwhile, at the headquarters of the German 8th Army, a Russian radio message confirmed the advance of the Russian II Corps north of Lake Mauer, which had already been reported by the fortress of L\u00f6tzen. According to this radio message, the corps was to join hands with the Russian Narew Army. Parts of it had already been observed marching south west of the lake by 10 a.m. on August 26.</body>\n<footer>1) According to Russian reports, ordered only at 5 p.m. (Sichowitsch in Giorniti, Issue 3, p. 132).</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "173": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die beiden Korps der Ostgruppe waren daher schon\".

It already required a will to victory borne by confidence in the superiority of the German troops to approve the intentions of the commanding generals for August 27 in view of these circumstances. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg and General Ludendorff did not hesitate to give their consent.\nMeanwhile, the 1st Cavalry Division continued to cover the rear of the Eastern Group. On August 26, it had retreated to Schippenbeil before strong enemy cavalry and had received orders from the army command at noon to now delay any advance of the Russian II Corps on Rastenburg\u2014Korschen, while the fortress of K\u00f6nigsberg\u00b9) was entrusted with blocking the Alle line. At the same time, the fortress itself was to attract as many enemy forces as possible.\nOn August 27, the two corps of the German Eastern Group continued their offensive movement south over Wartenburg and Bischofsburg. The I Reserve Corps left the infantry of the 6th Landwehr Brigade, which was particularly worn out by marches and combat, and the XVII Army Corps a small mixed detachment, as immediate rear cover in the area of Lautern. Only gradually did it become apparent that the enemy no longer intended to resist south of Bischofsburg. He was in full retreat south to Ortelsburg.\nGeneraloberst v. Hindenburg and General Ludendorff had been waiting since taking command for the moment when it would be possible to deploy parts of the Eastern Group westward against the flank and rear of the Narew Army. But only in the early morning of August 27, when more detailed reports on the extent of the victory achieved at Gro\u00df-Bi\u00dfau came in, did this plan gain prospects of realization.

Below then moved his entire corps to the area of Patricken and asked the XVII Army Corps, in view of the fatigue of the troops of his reserve corps, to take over the dispatch of a detachment to Passenheim. \u2014 At the XVII Army Corps, the pursuit had only ended with darkness. The bulk of the corps had advanced only about 22 km after the exertions of the previous days, with the beginning to Mensguth, then small mixed detachments had been set on the enemy's trail. One of them (1 battalion, 1/2 squadron, 1 battery) reached far ahead of the corps front in the night of August 28 at 2:15 Passenheim. Meanwhile, the East Prussian wire connection to L\u00f6tzen had ceased on the eastern flank. After the aviation detachment had moved to the XX Army Corps, communication was only maintained by carrier pigeons. \u2014 Further north, the 1st Cavalry Division had not succeeded in preventing the enemy from reaching Rastenburg with the southernmost column of its II Corps by 11:00 a.m. on August 27. Lieutenant General Brecht faced strong Russian cavalry east of the Zaine and therefore remained west of this section. In the evening, he was at Bischofstein. The attempt by the K\u00f6nigsberg government to block the Alle line was also unsuccessful. Cavalry of the Njemen Army reached the crossings of Friedland and Allenburg before they were secured by Landsturm sent there. The fortress itself expected the Russian encirclement; its forces were fully engaged in defending the extensive Pregel and Deime positions. Thus, the land south of Bischofstein from K\u00f6nigsberg was open to the enemy for deployment. The weak Landsturm battalions distributed here in railway protection had no resistance strength.

As already mentioned, he had ordered the VI Corps to advance towards Allenstein for the upcoming battle. It must be assumed that the army group also agreed with this measure. The order was apparently repeated again on the afternoon of August 26. The corps was to \"immediately and swiftly advance to support the XIII Corps\" towards Allenstein and strike into the left flank of the Germans. The order was not executed; instead, the commanding general, General Blagowjeschtschenski, reported his retreat to south of Bischofsburg to the high command. The neighboring corps, however, with whom there was no connection, initially learned nothing of these events. Then he continued his retreat on August 27 together with the 4th Cavalry Division to the area southeast of Ortelsburg. The army high command also knew nothing of this. It suspected no more than the Russian corps adjacent to the VI (II of the Njemen Army and XIII) that the two escaped German corps were actually following the Russian VI Corps and thus marching into the flank and rear of the Narew Army.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "176": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die gegen 3\u00b0 nachmittags eingehende Weisung,\".

However, he counted on the forces assembled at Usdau being sufficient to repel the German attack. Their northern flank was to be covered by the 2nd Infantry Division, which was ordered to face the front again2). What image the Russian high command had of the German forces at M\u00fchlen and in the area of Hohenstein\u2014Allenstein\u2014Osterode is not known. It must be assumed, however, that it did not even remotely consider the presence of such strong German forces \u2014 four divisions in infantry strength \u2014 as actually stood at M\u00fchlen and behind the Drewenz, and instead believed Allenstein to be occupied. Thus, General Samsonow was determined, despite the unfavorable outcome of the battles west of Usdau and south of M\u00fchlen and despite the apparent serious threat to his left flank, to continue the attack of the XIII and XV Corps, later supported by the VI, against the line Allenstein\u2014Osterode.\nOn the night of August 27, the Russian army high command ordered the XIII Corps to advance further on Allenstein together with the VI Corps and to consider supporting the XV Corps. This corps itself was to send four regiments, which was half of its infantry, to M\u00fchlen to support the 2nd Infantry Division, to which parts of the 3rd Guards Infantry Division from Mlawa were also marching.\nThe Russian XIII Corps under General Klujew accordingly turned northward on August 27 with 1\u00bd divisions against Allenstein, which it occupied at noon without a fight. Reports of German troops 15 km south of the city (probably I Reserve Corps at Patricken), which reached the eastern division of the corps, were not believed and not passed on: they must be parts of the expected own VI Corps from the east! However, the connection with this corps could not be established. A flyer sent to Wartenburg did not return. \u2014 To support the XV Corps, General Klujew sent the reinforced 2nd Brigade of his 1st Infantry Division to Hohenstein.

Thus, a brigade of the XIII and three brigades of the XV Corps advanced to attack. Parts of the XIII Corps brigade came, without encountering German troops, as far south as Reichenau into the flank of the German 3rd Reserve Division. However, the bulk of this brigade got lost in the Jablonken forest; panic ensued. Therefore, all its parts were called back to the northeast exit of the forest in the evening. \u2014 The attack of the XV Corps, still suffering from the aftermath of the losses of August 23, also advanced slowly against the front of the German position and ultimately failed in the course of the afternoon2). \u2014 The 1st Brigade of the 8th Infantry Division, designated to support the 2nd Infantry Division, did not fight at all on August 27. It was led south to Waplitz and remained there. The 2nd Infantry Division itself had lost so much ground in the unfortunate battle on August 26 that it did not act as a flank guard for the I Corps. It was initially incapable of any serious resistance3). However, as the Germans ceased their advance on this part of the front on the morning of August 27, the 1st Brigade of the division was able to reorganize for defense in the afternoon at Bujaken and Frantenau. The arriving commanding general of the XXIII Corps, General Kondratowitsch, moved parts of his 3rd Guard Infantry Division advancing from Malwa, as well as the known Regiment Kexholm with a battery, to Rontsen (south of Frantenau) and designated the scattered 2nd Brigades of the 2nd Division Reidenburg as a rallying point on August 26.

The Army Order for August 28.</header>\n<body>(Map 6 and 7.)\nWhen it was decided in the midday hours of August 27 that the German I Army Corps was bound in the direction of Soldau and thus initially excluded from the thrust into the enemy's flank at Neidenburg, the decision lay primarily with the XX Army Corps. On the return journey from his command post to the army headquarters in L\u00f6bau, the commander-in-chief therefore sought out General v. Scholz in Fr\u00f6genau.\nBetween the perception of the XX Army Corps and that of the Army High Command, a certain divergence had developed in recent days\u00b9): The Army High Command had always regarded the ruthless attack as the only way out of the difficult situation for this army corps. However, within the corps itself, under the immediate impression of the Russian attacks directed against its front, especially the uncertain situation at M\u00fchlen and the threatening encirclement by the Russian XIII Corps in the north, there was more thought of holding off the enemy until the I Army Corps from the south or the eastern group would effectively act against its rear. This divergence of perception did not, as with the I Army Corps on August 25, come to an open confrontation; it remained unspoken but alive beneath the surface. Thus, the Army High Command was disappointed when the attack of the XX Army Corps did not get underway during the course of August 27. However, the commander-in-chief had personally pressed General v. Scholz in the afternoon that the 41st Infantry Division, which could only have a very inferior opponent in front of it, should reach Waplitz by the evening of August 27 and thereby block the Russians' path to the south. But even that did not succeed\u00b2).\nNevertheless, and despite the threatening enemy encirclement in the north near Reichenau, the Army High Command on the evening of August 27 looked forward to the continuation of the battle for the following day with full confidence.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) p. 163. \u2014 \u00b2) p. 167.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Fortgang der Schlacht f\u00fcr den folgenden Tag mit voller Zuversicht entgegen.</fragment_2>", "180": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \n\"Mit diesen Kr\u00e4ften wollte Generaloberst v.

Although some things had gone differently than planned, great achievements were made. At Usdau and Bischofsburg, the flanks of the Russian Narew Army were defeated, their center at M\u00fchlen was bloodily repelled; the Njemen Army was still far off. Thus, on August 28, the German Eastern Group could freely dispose of its corps. On this day, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg intended to attack and annihilate the center of the Russian Narew Army simultaneously from the south, west, north, and east.\nAccording to reports available by the evening of August 27 about this part of the enemy army, the German High Command assumed the Russian XV Corps was in front of the Drewenz position. South of the XV, strong parts of the Russian XXIII Corps were defeated and, it seemed, had retreated over Neidenburg. North of the XV, the Russian XIII Corps was known. Based on intercepted radio messages and the appearance of Russian forces at Reichenau, it was believed that this corps had turned west to support the XV Corps. Then General Samsonow could resume the attack against the German XX Corps on August 28. However, there was also the possibility that, due to the defeat, he would break off his wing of the battle and begin a retreat. Both possibilities had to be prepared for.\nOn the German side, the I Army Corps and also the XVII Army Corps, which seemed to be still engaged in pursuing the Ortelsburg enemy, were initially unavailable for the fight against the center of the Russian Narew Army. However, they could still become effective against the Russian retreat routes, especially the XVII Army Corps, as the situation developed. Against the Russian XV and XIII Corps \u2014 possibly also parts of the XXIII \u2014 the Germans had the XX Army Corps, reinforced by the 3rd Reserve Division and fortress troops, the Landwehr Division Goltz arriving at Osterode and Biessellen (15 km east of Osterode), and the X Reserve Corps assembled south of Wartenburg at their disposal, in total four active infantry divisions, three reserve divisions, as well as Landwehr and fortress troops with an infantry strength of another two to three divisions, but with only very weak artillery. With these forces, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg intended to encircle and annihilate the enemy on August 28.

According to the absolutely reliable report of an officer patrol from the Reserve Dragoon Regiment 5 (of the 3rd Reserve Division), a whole Russian infantry division had moved into Allenstein from the south by noon on August 27. The enemy was stronger there than previously assumed. This presented a new possibility: If General Samsnow abandoned the fight, the Russian XIII Corps could attempt to escape eastward to General v. Rennenkampf and join hands with the Russian XV Corps, which had already reached parts of Rastenburg by 11 a.m. on August 27. The rear connections of the XVII Army Corps and the I Reserve Corps seemed severely threatened. Since Russian cavalry was already skirmishing near Heilsberg, only the road Wartenburg\u2014Guttstadt remained open.\nUnder these circumstances, the army high command accepted a proposal made by the chief of staff of the I Reserve Corps simultaneously with the report on the enemy at Allenstein. The corps intended to advance on Allenstein on the morning of August 28 together with the XVII Army Corps, with this army corps taking the direction over Wartenburg on the northern flank. Since there was no telephone connection from the high command to the XVII Army Corps, the I Reserve Corps was to arrange the necessary details with it.\nThrough the modification of the army order, the high command now deployed the entire Landwehr Division Goltz on Hohenstein and ordered for the eastern group: \"Reinforced I Reserve Corps and parts of the XVII Army Corps attack the enemy at Allenstein.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Armeekorps greifen den Feind bei Allenstein an.</fragment_2>", "182": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Das Generalkommando des XX.

A rear guard was to protect the flank and rear. However, in the dark night on unknown field paths, the assembly already suffered delays, parts lost their way.\nIn the dense fog, Major General Schaer led the vanguard against Waplitz. At the Maranse, a battle ensued, in which brave musketeers from the II Battalion of the Infantry Regiment Baron v. S\u00fcringten (4th Posen's) No. 59, supported by parts of the Masurian Pioneer Battalion No. 26, waded through the river west of Waplitz and advanced more than 1 km further north. But their success could not be recognized in time by the neighbors in the fog and therefore could not be exploited. The battle stood at the Maranse. The attack did not regain momentum here either, when east of the vanguard the 74th Infantry Brigade under Major General Reiser entered the fight. The enemy resistance increased more and more. Around 7 a.m., the fog cleared. The losses increased. The attackers also began to suffer from enemy artillery flanking fire from the east. Then suddenly from the south, from the direction of Frantenaul\u2014Bujaken, Russian artillery fire hit their rear. Southwest of Wittmannsdorf, parts of the 74th Infantry Brigade and the artillery had to take the front to the south. They had a hard time against the enemy appearing on the heights south and east of Wittmannsdorf, but managed to repel his attacks. The attempt to hold out in this situation seemed hopeless to the division commander soon. So Major General Sonntag ordered the retreat to the starting position between Konti and Hynnaul Lake at 7:30 a.m. The 8 battalions and 6 batteries of the division, already encircled in a semicircle east of the M\u00fchlen Lake, had to retreat through the only 2\u00bd km wide opening between the Russians east of Wittmannsdorf and the southern tip of the lake. With relatively minor losses, they found their way west. Above all, the deployment of the II Battalion of the Teutonic Order Regiment Ar. 152 and the batteries of the 1st West Prussian Field Artillery Regiment No. 35, as well as the inactivity of the Russians was to thank for the fact that the battle did not end with the capture of significant parts of the division.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) 2 battalions and 2 squadrons were with the I Army Corps, 1 battalion had been tasked with clearing the battlefield from the 26th since early August 27 and had not yet returned.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Russen war es zu danken, da\u00df der Kampf nicht mit der Gefangennahme wesentlicher Teile der Division endete.</fragment_2>", "185": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"General v.

Morgen reported that he had ordered the attack for the troops under his command, and it was already underway. The General Command was initially not in agreement with the general's autonomy but had to accept the accomplished fact. Therefore, the 37th Infantry Division also received orders to immediately advance over Reichenau to attack.\nOn the attack front of Lieutenant General v.

He intended to proceed according to the corps order as soon as the advance of the 41st Infantry Division on Paulsgut became noticeable.\nIn front of the 3rd Reserve Division, the Jablonken Forest had still been occupied by the Russians on the evening of August 27; however, it was found free again during the night. No reports about the Reichenau enemy were available by morning. Concerns about this opponent were completely dispelled since the 37th Infantry Division had reported at 7 a.m. that it was ready at Rittnau and Domtau (northwest of Geiserswalde). The fog had meanwhile lifted, but there was still no sign of the 41st Infantry Division's attack. On the other hand, the Goltz Landwehr Division had to be advancing from the north on Hohenstein since 5 a.m. Thus, General v. Morgen decided not to wait any longer but to exploit the currently favorable situation in the Jablonken Forest. At 7:20 a.m., he ordered the attack on the entire front from Lake M\u00fchlen to north of Kirsteinsdorf on his own responsibility. The left wing brigade of his division (6th Reserve Infantry Brigade) was to pass through the Jablonken Forest, outflank the enemy position at Dr\u00f6bnitz in the north, and thereby facilitate the heavy attack of the 5th Reserve Infantry Brigade against the Russian front. Only when the attack was underway did General v. Morgen report the already mentioned message to the general command.\nWith Major General v. Unger, the attack of Major General Breithaupt with his particularly weak 70th Landwehr Brigade in artillery stalled at the Drewenz section east of M\u00fchlen. The replacement battalions of the Deputy 69th Infantry Brigade under Major General van Semmern reached the eastern edge of the large forest north of the road to Paulsgut by noon in a tough advance. At the 3rd Reserve Division itself, the 5th Reserve Infantry Brigade under Major General Hesse attacked Dr\u00f6bnitz on the right wing. In a costly frontal battle, it captured the stubbornly defended location at 12:30 p.m. Immediate support from the 6th Reserve Infantry Brigade from the north was absent. This brigade, under Major General Krause, had reached the eastern edge of the Jablonken Forest by 10 a.m., but was pinned down here by the enemy, who stood on both sides of the Hohensteiner road near Schwentainen. In a sharp attack, the Pomeranian reserve troops threw the enemy back over Sauden to Hohenstein.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>die pommerschen Reservetruppen den Gegner \u00fcber Sauden auf Hohenstein zur\u00fcck.</fragment_2>", "187": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Der Kommandeur des Bremer Landwehr-Regiments 75, Oberstleutnant\".

At 12:30 noon, they entered the burning city. The Russian resistance in this area had increasingly weakened, as simultaneously from the north, German troops had approached Hohenstein to within 500 meters.\nWhen the commander of the Landwehr Division, Lieutenant General Freiherr v. der Goltz, received the army order to advance via Manchengut to Hohenstein on the evening of August 27 in Biessellen (halfway between Osterode and Allenstein), only 7 battalions, 4 squadrons, and 1 battery of his troops were present. The arrival of the rest was delayed indefinitely due to a train collision. The division commander had information that Russian cavalry was south of Manchengut on his advance route and that a stronger enemy was in Hohenstein. He was also informed that a Russian division was in Allenstein. South of there, Russians were also supposed to be on the road to Hohenstein up to Darethin. Despite this flank threat, General v. der Goltz immediately decided to march on Hohenstein with his initially available, albeit very limited, forces; what was still missing, 5 battalions and 3 batteries, was to follow later from Biessellen.\nAfter a 16 km march, the vanguard of the Landwehr Division reached the southern edge of the K\u00e4mmerer Forest north of Hohenstein around 9 a.m. The cannon thunder, which had been heard during the advance in the south, had subsided. Russian movements from Hohenstein to the east were observed. The enemy seemed to be retreating.\nThe division commander decided to attack. The Russians took up positions in and north of the Hohenstein\u2014M\u00f6rten line for defense. Against them, 6\u00bd battalions and 1 battery were deployed one after the other as they arrived; only \u00bd battalion was left by Lieutenant General Freiherr v. der Goltz as a security at the K\u00e4mmerer Forest in case the enemy at Allenstein advanced southwest. This enemy had only a 25 km march to Hohenstein, so if he had set out early in the morning, he could appear in the flank and rear of the Landwehr by noon. Therefore, there was perhaps little time to settle accounts with the enemy at Hohenstein. But the German attack, supported by only a single battery and without machine guns, soon stalled despite all the bravery of the Schleswig-Holstein and Hanseatic militia. The losses were felt.

Flanked from the west, the Russians gave up resistance and left five guns in the hands of the now advancing Landwehr.\nBy the early afternoon hours of August 28, the troops of Major General v. Unger, the 3rd Reserve Division, and the Landwehr Division Goltz had achieved victory west of Paulsgut, near Dr\u00f6bnitz, Hohenstein, and M\u00f6rten, and were pursuing the retreating enemy. Only at the road crossing east of M\u00fchlen, crucial for covering his retreat, did the enemy still offer stubborn resistance.\nThe German 37th Infantry Division (10 battalions, 2 squadrons, 12 batteries) under Lieutenant General v. Staabs had not yet entered the battle. Their deployment in the morning had already been delayed due to a night march on difficult paths, fog, and the exhaustion of the troops<sup>1</sup>). The division cavalry tasked with reconnaissance at Hohenstein was missing; the order had not reached them. Without news of the changed situation at Reichenau since the evening of August 27, Lieutenant General v. Staabs believed the enemy to be directly in front of him. Without further orders from the General Command (the order at 8:30 a.m.<sup>2</sup>) to attack via Reichenau was not reached) and without knowledge of the 3rd Reserve Division's attack, the regiments of the 37th Infantry Division finally deployed from their wide formation, crossed the stream west of Reichenau at 10:00 a.m., and advanced further towards the Drewenz section.

The Battles of the I Army Corps and the Pursuit until Evening.\n(Maps 7 and 8.)\nAt the Army High Command in Fr\u00f6genau, the tension had been great in the morning hours: From the 41st Infantry Division, whose success was to signal the attack at the front, no news; at least it was delayed, whether it would still break through? \u2014 Why doesn't the XX Army Corps attack north of the M\u00fchlen Lake? Does it want to wait even longer for the 41st Division? \u2014 Whether the enemy is perhaps already retreating and pressing south against this division? Or whether he is still standing, perhaps even attacking? \u2014 What will the Russians do in Allenstein? As long as Lieutenant General v. Below does not engage them, they have full freedom of movement to Hohenstein or to Rennenkampf. The latter question was clarified shortly after 8 a.m. by radio messages from the Russian XIII Corps: the Allenstein enemy was marching on Hohenstein, the Russian commanding general wanted to be at the start of his vanguard at Grieslienen, 5 km before Hohenstein, by noon. The longer the XX Army Corps waited to attack, the more the enemy strengthened. \u2014 And alongside all these questions, always the concern: what will Rennenkampf do? Must the situation not reveal itself to him? \u2014 What then, if he clearly sees that he has no significant German forces in front of him? The uncertainty became increasingly agonizing.\nIn this situation, the attack decision of Lieutenant General v. Morgen acted as the redeeming deed. But then, at 9 a.m., the long-awaited news from the 41st Infantry Division came and stated that the division had encountered strong enemy forces at Waplitz and had retreated, hoping to hold the heights south of the M\u00fchlen Lake. The hopes that had just been awakened were significantly dampened: a sensitive setback had occurred, the enemy, whom they wanted to encircle, now had the way south to Neidenburg open.

Fran\u00e7ois allowed his troops a longer night's rest than was possible for the XX Army Corps. On August 28 at 6 a.m., they stood ready in dense fog at their camps to continue the attack southward on Soldau. However, General v. Fran\u00e7ois had not lost sight of his original mission, the pursuit over Neidenburg. Since he no longer considered the enemy at Soldau as strong as the evening before, he had already directed the cavalry stationed at Gro\u00df-Schl\u00e4ffken (Ulan Regiment 8 and a battery of the 1st Infantry Division, along with two squadrons of the XX Army Corps) towards Neidenburg and had also prepared the entire 2nd Infantry Division for departure there. With the remaining forces, he initially wanted to push the enemy over the Soldau section, but then let the 1st Division follow the 2nd to Neidenburg.\nWhen the Army High Command learned of General v. Fran\u00e7ois's intentions at 7:30 a.m., long before receiving the bad news from the 41st Infantry Division, it had no objections but emphasized \"the importance of the I Army Corps reaching Neidenburg, with cavalry Willenberg, as soon as possible.\" However, when the news of the 41st Infantry Division's retreat arrived, it was necessary to bring help to this division quickly. Thus, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg ordered at 9 a.m. that the 2nd Infantry Division \"immediately march on Rontken\" (southeast of the Rowanzker Lake) \"to prevent a breakthrough by the enemy, and indeed by attack.\" The troops belonging to the XX Army Corps under Generalleutnant v. Schmettau were also to march there.\nThis order reached the I Army Corps when the 2nd Infantry Division had already begun its march eastward. All other troops, however, were engaged in the attack on Soldau. The enemy offered only rear-guard resistance here, and the mass had been able to continue their retreat undisturbed during the night. Thus, the 5th Landwehr Brigade, the 1st Infantry Division, and the detachment v. Schmettau pushed back the Russian rear guards, who were still north of the Soldau River, with ease during the morning hours. Only a few prisoners and abandoned guns fell into their hands. The bridges were destroyed. The Russians covered their retreat with long-range artillery fire. The continuation of the attack across the river was halted when flyers reported that the Russians had continued their retreat beyond Mlawa. At Soldau, the 5th Landwehr Brigade now remained as security. The detachment v.

Army Corps received this army order around 3:00 in the afternoon 7 km west of Neidenburg near Lissfaten. From here, Lieutenant General v. Falk with his 2nd Infantry Division was advancing in a broad front against an enemy who had made himself noticeable from the northeast. The Uhlan Regiment 8 (6 squadrons and 1 battery)<sup>1</sup> had crossed the Neide south of the city of Neidenburg, while the cavalry of the 2nd Infantry Division and the advancing foremost parts of the v. Schmettau detachment soon also advanced from the west against this city. The enemy (again assembled parts of the 2nd Brigade of the Russian 2nd Infantry Division and small parts of the 3rd Guard Infantry Division) did not engage in any serious battle at Neidenburg but retreated to the east.\nGeneral v. Fran\u00e7ois, however, now did everything to achieve the pursuit objectives set by the army command still on August 28. After the morning attack on Soldau and a subsequent march of over 25 km in the August heat, Lieutenant General v. Schmettau with his detachment from the XX. Army Corps (6 battalions, 2 squadrons, and 3 batteries) only reached the area east of Neidenburg by evening. But the detachment felt capable of marching further north. Thus, General v. Fran\u00e7ois sent them forward to Muschaken during the night, which they reached without encountering the enemy by 3:00 in the morning on August 29. Behind this detachment, the 1st Infantry Division, partially only by midnight, reached the area of Neidenburg.\nFurther north, the attack of the 2nd Infantry Division had meanwhile only progressed slowly.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>inzwischen nur langsam vorw\u00e4rts gekommen.</fragment_2>", "193": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"nach\".

As we know today, apart from a still completely fresh Russian Guard Regiment with three batteries, only half of the 6th Cavalry Division faced them. But the German 2nd Infantry Division, after the previous exertions and battles, especially the setback on the morning of August 27, no longer had its old striking power. Cavalry and heavy artillery had been detached. Nevertheless, the division succeeded in pushing the enemy back everywhere during the afternoon and capturing the main road Neidenburg\u2014Hohenstein by nightfall at Salusken and Ronken. The goal set by the Army High Command, Gr\u00fcnflie\u00df, could not be reached; nor was it possible to establish contact with the 41st Infantry Division by nightfall.\nGeneral v. Fran\u00e7ois had already arranged for the continuation of the pursuit for August 29. According to this, the v. Schmettau detachment was to reach the important road junction Willenberg far ahead on that day. The commanding general wanted to keep the two divisions of his own army corps closer together east of Neidenburg at first, in order to have sufficient forces at hand in the event of a Russian breakthrough attempt at this point. Therefore, the 1st Infantry Division was to advance only to Muschaken, the 2nd only to Gr\u00fcnflie\u00df.\nAt the XX Army Corps, the concern that the 41st Infantry Division might not hold its position had already disappeared by noon on August 28. The enemy did not press forward, and it was assumed at the General Command at that time that he would now also retreat before the 41st Infantry Division.\nAt 1:37 p.m., General v. Scholz ordered the general pursuit based on the army order. The 41st Infantry Division was to follow the enemy to Orlau, the troops of Lieutenant General v. Morgen to advance on Kurten, the 37th Infantry Division, it was further stated, \"turns against the Russian XIII Corps advancing from Allenstein and soon to be attacked in the rear and flank by the I Reserve Corps.\"\nWhen the commander of the 41st Infantry Division, Major General Sonntag, received the pursuit order, the enemy was still temporarily strong in front of his front. His own division, however, was, apart from the heavy losses of the previous battles, due to hard marches and over-marches, exhausting readiness, after entrenchment activities and partially significant supply difficulties, so worn out that the general initially considered an advance to attack to be out of the question and reported this to the General Command accordingly.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>licher Schanzt\u00e4tigkeit und teilweise gro\u00dfer Verpflegungsschwierigkeiten so mitgenommen, da\u00df der General ein Vorgehen zum Angriff zun\u00e4chst f\u00fcr ausgeschlossen hielt und in diesem Sinne auch dem Generalkommando meldete.</fragment_2>", "194": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Schon gegen Mittag, als die halbe Landwehr-Division Goltz noch\".

Morgen, the pursuit had been in full swing since noon. Only opposite M\u00fchlen, at the most sensitive point for the Russian retreat, had the artillery-weak 70th Landwehr Brigade not yet advanced. The army high command kept urging here. The attack only gained momentum when the parts left behind by the 37th Infantry Division at M\u00fchlen (3 battalions and 3 batteries)\u00b9) were deployed. Under the simultaneous pressure of the replacement battalions of the deputy 69th Infantry Brigade from the north, the Russians retreated eastward at 3 p.m. A large number fell into German captivity. In pursuit, the Landwehr and replacement troops of Major General v. Unger reached Ganshorn and Paulsgut by evening.\nAt the 3rd Reserve Division, which had recorded its first major battle and full victory on August 28, Lieutenant General v. Morgen wanted to preempt the Russians withdrawing on the main road Hohenstein-Schwedrich. He deployed three battalions, three squadrons, and a battery from the west on Schwedrich-Kurten and gave the same target to the 5th Reserve Infantry Brigade, while the 6th Reserve Infantry Brigade was still tied up at Hohenstein. However, when a new order from the general command arrived after 6 p.m., stating that the division should now advance southwest to Orlau instead of east to Kurken, to cut off the retreat of the enemy still holding out according to the report of the 41st Infantry Division, the 5th Reserve Infantry Brigade turned south west of Kunschengut and reached the area north of Waplitz in the evening. Meanwhile, the mixed detachment sent ahead to Schwedrich had to turn back in the darkness before the Russian-held estate of Nadrau.\nDuring these events, there were battles against a new enemy at Hohenstein.\nAlready around noon, when half of the Landwehr Division Goltz was still with the front facing south against the Hohenstein-M\u00f6rken road in attack, broad skirmish lines from the Russian XIII Corps had advanced southwest over Grieslienen.\n</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) p. 187.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>mit der Front nach S\u00fcden gegen die Stra\u00dfe Hohenstein\u2014M\u00f6rken im Angriff lag), waren breite Sch\u00fctzenlinien vom russischen XIII.

Just at this time, the 2nd Landwehr Battery had arrived at the southern edge of the Kammerei Forest after three-quarters of an hour of trot and gallop from Biessellen. The two light batteries of the division and three Landwehr battalions arriving one after the other on the road brought the new enemy to a halt and thereby covered the further attack against Hohenstein\u2014M\u00f6rken from the rear. The half-division attacking here under Generalmajor v. Derxen had initially followed south of the Mispel Lake, but had to also face the Grieslien enemy by evening. Attempts to gain more ground to the east, where the Schwedicher road led through the narrow lakes, met with resistance. The attack power of the Landwehr was no longer sufficient to break it and thereby delay the enemy's further retreat. M\u00f6rken, through which the Landwehr had gone south in pursuit in the afternoon, was later reoccupied by the Russians behind them. West of this part of the Landwehr Division, the 6th Reserve Infantry Brigade had cleared Hohenstein of Russians in several hours of house-to-house fighting in the afternoon and captured 2000 prisoners. In the evening, the brigade was south of the city.\nThe Russian XIII Corps had not expected to encounter the enemy already west of Grieslienen during its advance. When it recognized the situation, it gradually moved superior forces northward into the Kammerei Forest, while only minor reinforcements arrived on the German side. Thus, an undecided back-and-forth forest battle developed in the afternoon hours, which ultimately ended in favor of the Russians because the German regimental commander in charge of this part of the battlefield, for unexplained reasons, attempted to withdraw his troops from the forest to reorganize them for new resistance west of the Amling Ground.\nMeanwhile, Lieutenant General v. Staabs had also arrived with the beginning of the 37th Infantry Division around 3 p.m. west of Hohenstein. He expected that the enemy would already be pushed from the east by the I Reserve Corps and was determined to attack immediately with his active division. However, the troops of the 37th Infantry Division, exhausted from marches, arrived only gradually and mostly with such delay that by the evening of August 28th, only the artillery could be put into action.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>28.

The Advance of the German Eastern Group.\n(Map 7.)\nSince the occupation of Allenstein by the Russians, both telephone and motor vehicle connections between the Army High Command and the corps of the Eastern Group were extraordinarily difficult. Thus, the army order issued on the evening of August 27 had to be transmitted by the I Reserve Corps, which had received it in Wartenburg via telephone, to the XVII Army Corps. To immediately arrange what was necessary for the joint attack on Allenstein, the deputy chief of staff of the I Reserve Corps, Colonel Count v. P\u00f6sadowsky-Wehner, personally went to the corps headquarters of General v. Mackensen in Rauschung and there \u2014 according to the records made at the XVII Army Corps \u2014 presented the following as the will of the Army High Command: \u201cXVII Army Corps and I Reserve Corps will jointly attack the enemy standing at Allenstein tomorrow.

Detachment Passenheim is also desired to advance on Allenstein.\u201d\nThe XVII Army Corps was until then in full pursuit on Jedwabno and eastward. Therefore, General v. Mackensen initially resisted the instruction transmitted by Count P\u00f6sadowsky, according to which the corps had to turn back to advance on Allenstein, with the utmost determination. He apparently only relented when Major Drechsel, who was assigned as liaison officer of the High Command to the I Reserve Corps, received the same order at 10:30 in the evening, albeit in the following more accurate version: \u201cFrom the Army High Command 10\u00b0 in the evening.

Army Corps, whereby it was agreed that this corps would no longer be supported by the I. Reserve Corps on Allenstein. Thus, on August 28, the XVII. Army Corps moved with both divisions over Wartenburg and north, bypassing the I. Reserve Corps, towards Allenstein. The beginning of the forward-deployed southern division of the corps was to be 4 km west of Wartenburg at 12\u00b0 noon. The pursuit detachments set to the south were withdrawn again, with the sole exception of those designated to move over Mensguth to Ortelsburg.\nIn the I. Reserve Corps, the urging of the Army High Command for an early departure had no effect. Lieutenant General v. Below wanted to await the arrival of the XVII. Army Corps to be able to conduct the attack together with it more powerfully. He set out with both divisions side by side on August 28 at 10\u00b0 in the morning from the area south of Wartenburg, and could therefore only arrive in front of Allenstein around 2\u00b0 in the afternoon.\nAt 10\u00b0 in the morning, half an hour after the corps had begun its advance, the General Command received the report from an officer patrol of the Reserve Hussar Regiment No. 1 that only weak enemy forces were present at Allenstein. Lieutenant General v. Below was of the opinion that the enemy could only have marched south and decided accordingly to take a more southerly marching direction in accordance with the army order. Shortly thereafter, a flyer delivered an order from the Army High Command from the morning of the 28th, which, based on intercepted Russian radio messages\u00b9), directed the I. Reserve Corps in the same direction. It was to \"proceed ruthlessly on the shortest route to its positions-Griesslienen. Urgency required.\" However, for the XVII.

Below independently connected with him. He suggested to him to turn south again towards Passenheim, in order to relocate the enemy's retreat to the east according to the original idea. However, General v. Mackensen and his general staff were not in agreement with this, as the corps had just been recalled from its advance on Jedwabno, as they assumed at the instigation of the I. Reserve Corps: The XVII. Army Corps was now north of the I. Reserve Corps advancing on Allenstein and barely an hour and a half behind it. According to the proposal of the I. Reserve Corps, it would have had to proceed south again, once more behind the marching columns of this corps. However, General v. Mackensen feared that the corps, after the previous marches, would arrive too late for the great battle, which he assumed was near the lakes. He did not know the state of this battle, and so it seemed to him appropriate that the XVII. Army Corps should take the march direction to Stabigotten, as was planned in the army order of August 27 for the right wing of the forces set on Allenstein. Accordingly, General v. Mackensen, as the senior in service, demanded that the I. Reserve Corps clear the road Allenstein\u2014Stabigotten initially up to Darethen for the XVII. Army Corps. Since the troops had to take a march rest anyway, he sent Captain Bartenwerfer from the general staff of his army corps by plane to the army high command to report his intentions and to clarify the situation, which had become doubtful to him since the appearance of Colonel Count v.

Mackensen requested an immediate order, referring to the doubts and frictions that had arisen since the evening of August 27.

Generaloberst von Hindenburg therefore ordered that the XVII Army Corps should \"march as strong forces as possible to Jedwabno to intercept all Russian detachments coming out of the Allenstein-Hohenstein forest and what flees from the Russian XIII and XV Corps through the forest.\" At the same time, the main force should continue the pursuit southward; \"Sharp pressure on Ortelsburg, cavalry direction Rudczanny-Johannisburg.

The measures of General von Mackensen, which he sought to explain, primarily questioned the timely arrival of the I Reserve Corps on the battlefield, and it was precisely this that the army high command was eagerly awaiting. Despite the victory achieved, there was concern about the situation at Hohenstein. The Landwehr Division Goltz seemed seriously threatened there by the parts of the Russian XIII Corps advancing from Allenstein. The commander-in-chief was extremely displeased that General von Mackensen diverted the I Reserve Corps from its marching route, further delaying its engagement. Captain Bartenwerfer was tasked with ensuring that the I Reserve Corps intervened at Grieslienen without delay; the aim was the destruction of the enemy division marching on Hohenstein. Captain Bartenwerfer dropped the message board with a corresponding order at 4 p.m. over a marching column of the I Reserve Corps.\nThe I Reserve Corps had meanwhile continued its march on Stabigotten. The corps had only poor sandy roads available for this new advance direction. In the large forests east of Stabigotten, there was not even a continuous road connection to the west. Therefore, there was a justified reluctance to send significant parts of the corps through the pathless forest. There was no other choice but for the 1st Reserve Division to move from Stabigotten to Grieslienen, the 36th north of it to Darethen.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>die 36. n\u00f6rdlich davon \u00fcber Darethen anzusetzen.</fragment_2>", "200": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"die russische Njemen-Armee habe mit den Hauptkr\u00e4ften, anscheinend mit drei Korps, den Vormarsch nach Westen\".

To the German leadership, this seemed so self-evident that \nthere had been no explanation for General v. Rennenkampf's behavior for days. \nTherefore, his imminent intervention in the battle was now expected with certainty.\nThe German Army High Command had been considering future operations \nagainst the Rennenkampf army for several days.

The Supreme Army Command had first \npromised three and then, on the night of August 27, two corps from the west. \n\u2014 Since the evening of August 21, when Colonel General v.

Rather, General Ludendorff, \nwhen the reinforcements were promised, \"emphasized that they were not \nabsolutely necessary; if they were needed in the west, the east could manage \non its own.\" On the other hand, the Austro-Hungarian Army High Command \nhad shown disappointment at the loss of the divisions originally intended for \nEast Prussia. The German Supreme Army Command was therefore eager, \ngiven the still extremely serious situation in the east, to send reinforcements \nthere, which seemed dispensable in the west.

Until then, the 8th Army relied on its own forces.\nAllenstein had to be covered, and the arrival of reinforcements also had to be concealed to the north.\nIt had to be considered that the Russian Njemen Army, since the Battle of Gumbinnen, was probably reinforced by reserve divisions and perhaps also by other troops, so that even with the detachment of parts against K\u00f6nigsberg and L\u00f6tzen, it could still continue the advance to support the Narew Army with at least three corps and probably all five cavalry divisions. It would likely take the general direction towards Allenstein. It had 70 km to march there, so it could attack Allenstein on August 30, starting on August 28. If one did not want to arrive too late, German forces had to be prepared here by August 29 at the latest.\nIn anticipation of the new task, the headquarters of the 8th Army was moved from Libau to Osterode on August 28. It seemed necessary to immediately withdraw troops from the battle against the Narew Army and assemble them at Allenstein and to the north against the new enemy, while other parts in the south concluded the battle against Samsonow.\nThe situation at the front seemed to allow such a measure. Since noon on August 28, the German 8th Army's high command increasingly came to the conclusion that the conclusion of the three-day battle had been reached: \"As far as is now established, the Russian I Corps is in full flight over Mlava towards Warsaw, \u2014 Russian XXIII, XV, and XIII Corps scattered into the woods southeast of Hohenstein\u2014Allenstein, \u2014 Russian VI Corps, of which one division was completely destroyed 1), in full flight over Ortelsburg,\" thus began the army order given by Generaloberst v. Hindenburg on August 28 at 5:30 p.m. at Tannenberg. It was to conclude the battle against the Narew Army. The German I and XX Army Corps with the 3rd Reserve Division were also to remain in pursuit to the east, while the Landwehr and fortress troops gathered behind the front.

Immediately after issuing the order, General von Hindenburg wanted to proceed to M\u00fchlen to greet his victorious troops there. Heavy artillery, ammunition wagons, and vehicles from the train came rushing towards him east of Tannenberg on and beside the road: \"The Russians are coming,\" was all that could be learned from them. The command's motor vehicles had to swerve to avoid being overrun. Gradually, it was possible to fend off the wild flight. Columns of prisoners advancing in the haze of the battlefield, framed by the flashing bayonets of their German escorts, provided the explanation. But the road forward was so hopelessly blocked that the commander-in-chief had to refrain from continuing and immediately proceed to the new headquarters in Osterode.\nOn the evening of August 28, the army command was in full awareness of the victory achieved in three heavy days of fighting (it was believed that the planned encirclement of the Russians had succeeded despite all frictions). It knew the German I Army Corps was at Neidenburg, its cavalry ahead at Willenberg. It was believed that the I Reserve Corps had meanwhile arrived, and it was not yet suspected that the Kurleerer Narrow remained open to the enemy and that the XVII Army Corps had withdrawn the Passive Division. Thus, General Ludendorff reported on August 28 at 9:30 p.m. by telephone personally to the Supreme Army Command: \"Everything is fine. The encirclement of the Russian 2nd Army will succeed by human judgment. More definite and precise news cannot yet be given, as no reports from the army corps have yet reached the army command due to the great distances.\"\nThe orders for the deployment of the I Reserve Corps and XVII Army Corps at Allenstein had not yet been sent to them by 10 p.m. Reports on the conclusion of the battle north of Hohenstein were awaited.

He might still be taking his time. \u2014 Thus, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg decided to initially forego the provision at Allenstein and to use the I Reserve Corps against the Narew Army on August 29 as well. At 10 p.m., the corps were ordered to immediately continue the pursuit over Grieslienen to Hohenstein with one division, to advance with the other east of the lakes over Buttrienen to Jedwabno, and to push the cavalry forward to Ortelsburg. The further use of the XVII Army Corps was still reserved by the army command. Perhaps it would be urgently needed against Rennenkampf on August 29. The army corps was to await further orders on August 29 at 6 a.m. in its quarters, which were assumed to be at Wartenburg and south. On the other hand, the army command decided around midnight \u2014 despite the advance of the Njemen Army \u2014 to also deploy parts of the 1st Cavalry Division for pursuit to Ortelsburg. This division was, as far as the army command knew, the only troop unit\u00b9) still standing against the Russian Njemen Army, but also the only cavalry unit available to the army. Generalleutnant Brecht had just been able to report a success over Russian cavalry at R\u00f6\u00dfel. He now received the order to deploy a cavalry brigade for the pursuit of the Narew Army to Ortelsburg at 3 a.m. on August 29, \"Horsepower must not be spared.\" Only two cavalry brigades were to remain against the Njemen Army.\nAt midnight on August 28/29, General Ludendorff reported to the Supreme Army Command, again personally by telephone, a second evening report, from which the change in perception of the situation since the afternoon emerged and the deep disappointment that large parts of the enemy had escaped the intended encirclement west of the lakes. According to records at the Supreme Army Command, it was said: \"The battle is won. Pursuit will continue tomorrow. An encirclement of the two Russian corps will probably no longer succeed.\" (The two corps presumably referred to the Russian XIII and XV.)

However, General Ludendorff thought that within two days he would be finished with the enemy in this part of the theater of war.\nSoon after this report was sent, a Russian radio message in the early morning hours of August 29th brought further confirmation of the Niemen Army's advance. The following could be read from an order to General v. Rennenkampf: \"In view of the heavy fighting being conducted by the 2nd Army, the Commander-in-Chief has ordered to send forward for support . . . . . . . and cavalry for joint operations towards . . . . . . . . .\" This only confirmed previous expectations.\nOn the other hand, the German Supreme Army Command had definitively ordered during the same night of August 28/29 the assignment of the XI Army Corps, the Guard Reserve Corps, and the 8th Cavalry Division to the 8th Army. These reinforcements were expected in the first days of September. For protection and concealment of their unloading against the far westward-ranging cavalry of the Russian Niemen Army, only Landsturm battalions deployed for railway protection were available so far. As reinforcement, two Danzig replacement battalions were now moved forward to Braunsberg. The fortress of K\u00f6nigsberg was instructed to prevent the advance of the Niemen Army through powerful sorties.\nFurthermore, the Army High Command calculated that from the morning of August 29th, the following forces would be ready for deployment against the Niemen Army: At Waplitz (south of Hohenstein) Landwehr and fortress troops with a strength of about 1\u00bd divisions under Major General v. Unger, at Hohenstein the Landwehr Division Goltz, in the area east of Allenstein the XVII Army Corps, totaling 4\u00bd divisions. However, at 6:30 AM on August 29th, it turned out that this calculation, as far as the XVII Army Corps was concerned, was incorrect: General v. Mackensen had marched so far south on the afternoon of August 28th that the army order of 10 PM had not even reached him. Also with the I Reserve Corps, both divisions had already been deployed against Hohenstein when the army order arrived. The Army High Command let these already initiated movements continue. The XVII Army Corps maintained the blockade in the east. The idea of using the corps later on the northern wing of the army was not yet abandoned, as its columns and trains were stationed there. The Army Corps should therefore advance no further than Passenheim and Ortelsburg to the south.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>nach S\u00fcden vorsto\u00dfen.</fragment_2>", "206": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"General Ludendorff fuhr am 29.

However, the danger in which this corps itself was hovering might not have been apparent upon the arrival of General Samsnow in Nadarau.\nFrom Hohenstein to M\u00fchlen, the troops of General Martos, reinforced XV Corps, retreated in the afternoon after being defeated. The General had withdrawn the 2nd Brigade of the 8th Infantry Division from the front early in the morning due to the attack by the German 41st Infantry Division to support his left flank. Here, the 1st Brigades of the 8th and 2nd Infantry Divisions had already achieved full success south of Waplitz; however, it was not even locally exploited and could not change the overall situation. Instead, the advance of the German I Army Corps on Neidenburg during the afternoon also decisively shifted the situation on the southern flank of the Russian XV Corps in favor of the Russians.\nAt Neidenburg, General Kondratowitsch, the commanding general of the XXIII Corps, fortified. Under him were: the 1st Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division, confident again since their success in the morning, at Frankenau, \u2014 the Guard Regiment Resyholm with a battery and half of the 6th Cavalry Division at Rontzeln, \u2014 parts of the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division, severely shaken in their halt, at Neidenburg. In the afternoon, the Rontzken group was attacked by the German 2nd Infantry Division but held its ground; however, the Neidenburg group retreated eastward after a brief fight before the cavalry of the German I Army Corps. Since General Kondratowitsch sensed the approach of this German Army Corps from Soldau, he feared for his flank and therefore also withdrew the two northern combat groups from Frankenau and Rontzken to the east. They spent the night at Orlau. The Neidenburg group, however, moved to Willenberg and Janowod, and the commanding general himself went to Chorzele. He had left the main road Neidenburg\u2014Willenberg open for the Germans. He was soon relieved of his position for this\u00b9.\nThese events at Neidenburg were initially unknown in Nadarau. Thus, the retreat of the XV Corps was initially directed over Dietrichsdorf to Neidenburg.

Then he wanted to go to Janow to regain overall command of the army.\nMeanwhile, the XV Corps was marching behind the advanced covering troops towards Muschaken.

The 6th Reserve Brigade (from the 3rd Reserve Division) under Major General Krause and the half of the Landwehr Division Goltz still southeast of Hohenstein under Major General v. Oertzen joined this attack on the southern flank. They drove the enemy south of M\u00f6rken, then turned against the road bridge of Schlag-M\u00fchle, thus halting the Russian retreat. However, it was not until 2 p.m. that the 6th Reserve Infantry Brigade succeeded in taking the bridge itself and thus clearing the way for pursuit.\nMeanwhile, the fate of the now completely encircled rearguards of the Russian XIII Corps was sealed at M\u00f6rken and Griesslienen: The I Reserve Corps had set out again after a night rest of only a few hours at 3 a.m. Lieutenant General v.

The simultaneously besieged enemy from the west by the 37th Infantry Division suffered extraordinarily heavy losses in the crossfire of the German artillery, although mutual shelling of German troops also had to be accepted. Soon the Russians showed white flags. However, when they resumed the fight and shot two German parliamentarians, the German artillery also resumed its fire. Finally, over 8000 prisoners with seven guns surrendered at 10 a.m. An unmanageable number of vehicles, which the Russian corps had abandoned in its hasty retreat, was the further booty of the battle at this point.\nBy noon, it was possible, according to the order of the Army High Command, to gather the troops of the 37th Infantry Division.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>entsprechend, die Truppen der 37.

While it was supposed to quickly block the enemy's path along the 35 km road Neidenburg\u2014Willenberg to the border, it also had to anticipate a Russian breakthrough attempt on Neidenburg, as the only major road south to Mlawa led through Neidenburg.

Falk began the advance with the 2nd Infantry Division from Ronkitten in two columns in the morning, he soon encountered new resistance, against which the division gained ground only very slowly. Its commander saw no disadvantage in this. He wanted to give the German troops time on the main road to gain a lead and intended to coordinate his advance with that of the 41st Infantry Division from the XX Army Corps. However, it advanced even more slowly. Thus, the 2nd Infantry Division also reached the area north of Neidenburg fighting only by noon and followed the retreating enemy at least over Gr\u00fcnflie\u00df.

Then he withdrew his troops to Orlau.\nThe same Russian troops also held the German 1st Infantry Division north of Neidenburg for several hours.

Conta, whose troops had not yet advanced beyond Neidenburg at this time, deployed strong artillery north and northeast of the city. However, the enemy did not advance further here; rather, they were soon observed retreating southeast in the large forest east of Gr\u00fcnflie\u00df.

March disruptions and disorder were the result. On the evening of August 29, the remnants of the Russian XIII and XV Corps and three regiments of the XXIII Corps formed only a large, disordered mass striving southwest in the extensive forest area north of the Neidenburg\u2014Willenberg road. Leadership and organization had ceased. Nevertheless, the possibility of a breakthrough through the thin network of German encirclement in the confusing forest terrain was not yet completely ruled out.\nAt the Army High Command of the German 8th Army, there was hope that despite everything, it would still be possible to capture large parts of the Narew Army, having gained more ground over the course of August 29. Only in the morning hours had Russian breakthrough attempts on Neidenburg been expected, but then it became clear that the enemy was turning east. The reported numbers of prisoners and booty had increased hour by hour and had risen to at least 10,000 prisoners by the evening. The Narew Army was largely destroyed or encircled in the large forest area. The task was to tighten the circle around the encircled parts, estimated at 20\u201430,000 men in the evening, on August 30 to force their capture. At the same time, as strong forces as possible had to be freed up against the Russian Njemen Army.\nFrom the Rennenkampf Army, the cavalry had remained in brisk forward movement southwestward over the course of August 29. According to the available reports, it had reached R\u00f6\u00dfel and Bischofstein with the southern wing, further north a cavalry division seemed to be advancing over Heilsberg and Landsberg towards Wormditt. Only the two-brigade strong German 1st Cavalry Division had deviated to the infantry of the 6th Landwehr Brigade standing at Lautern. Guttstadt, Wormditt, Mehlsack, perhaps also Heilsberg and Binten, were still occupied by German Landsturm; two Danzig replacement battalions had reached Braunsberg. all that Colonel General v. Hindenburg initially had to oppose the Russian cavalry masses.\nBehind the veil of the Russian cavalry, the entire Njemen Army, according to the radio message intercepted early in the morning, was now advancing at an accelerated pace; the suspicion that the Russian II Corps would not begin the retreat to the border seemed confirmed by a new Russian radio message.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>s\u00e4mte Njemen-Armee nach dem am fr\u00fchen Morgen aufgefangenen Funkspruch) nunmehr im beschleunigten Vormarsch an; die Vermutung, da\u00df das russische II.

Further north, the K\u00f6nigsberg airship had detected smaller campfires, which it identified as cavalry, near Preu\u00dfisch-Eylau and further west, the larger ones only in the line Friedland\u2014Tapiau. The army command found it hard to believe that the corps of the Njemen Army were still so far back. Further reports were missing.\nAgainst the Njemen Army, the 37th Infantry Division, the I Reserve Corps, the Landwehr Division Goltz, and the 6th Landwehr Brigade, which was to be reunited, were already available. During August 30, more forces had to be freed. The initial task was to cover the encirclement of the Narew Army and the indispensable railway Deutsch-Eylau\u2014Allenstein for supplies and removal of loot. At the same time, the future battle against the Njemen Army had to be prepared. The further Rennenkampf advanced westward, the more decisively he could be met. The German army command expected his advance in the general direction of Allenstein and wanted to intercept the first impact in a position on both sides of this city. Then, in the further course of the battle, the remaining parts of the army and the incoming reinforcements could bring about the decision against the Russian flanks. The goal had to be not only to defeat this Russian army but to destroy it. For this, they would have to drive them towards K\u00f6nigsberg and the lagoon.\nThe army order for August 30 initially directed that the I Reserve Corps, together with the 37th Infantry Division and the 6th Landwehr Brigade, should begin the expansion of a position on both sides of Allenstein, front to the northeast. The Landwehr Division Goltz was then to block the lake line northeast of Osterode against Russian cavalry on August 31. The 1st Cavalry Division, not engaged with the enemy, was to retreat further south to Ortelsburg in case of further enemy advance.\nThese measures against the Russian Njemen Army were accompanied by orders to tighten the circle around the remnants of the Narew Army: The XVII Army Corps was to continue to block the eastern front, while the I Army Corps was to advance eastwards along the main road and north of it.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 207. \u2014 2) p. 203.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Ostfront absperren, w\u00e4hrend das I.

The 5th Landwehr Brigade was to advance from Soldau to Mlawa in pursuit of the Russian I Army Corps, according to the request of its commander. This also most effectively secured against any attempts by this enemy to disrupt the German encirclement at Neidenburg. Although it was observed in the morning moving from Mlawa to the southeast in Altmarrk, in the evening an aircraft observed an infantry brigade and additionally advancing troops on the Mlawa\u2014Neidenburg road, beginning at the German border. However, this movement was not considered significant. If necessary, the German troops resting at Waplitz were ready to support the I Army Corps.\nAfter the orders were issued, important news about the Njemen Army arrived at the army headquarters on the night of August 30. The expectation that General v. Rennenkampf, following the instructions of the commander-in-chief of the Northwest Front, would finally hurry to the aid of the Narew Army, did not seem to be confirmed. The reports rather indicated that the bulk of the Russian Njemen Army was still turning against K\u00f6nigsberg. The Russian IV Corps, the second from the south in the front of the Njemen Army, was supposed to have marched from Friedland not southwest to Bartenstein, but west to Domnau. As further indicated by an intercepted radio message, this corps was to enclose the fortress in the south\u00b9). North of it, the III and XX Corps had only advanced hesitantly to the Friedland\u2014Gawaiten line. Another intercepted Russian radio message on the morning of August 30 even made it questionable whether Rennenkampf still had any intentions of attack.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) The report that the Russian IV Corps had marched from Friedland to Domnau, like the intercepted radio message about the enclosure of K\u00f6nigsberg in the south, was overtaken by events.

However, they alone no longer posed a serious threat to the victorious German troops.\nThe German Army High Command could focus all its attention on the remnants of the Narew Army. Favorable news came from there. On August 30 at 9 a.m., it was possible to report to the Supreme Army Command: \"The success of the 8th Army is complete. The commanding general of the Russian XV Corps has been captured. The circle of pursuit is getting tighter. Already many prisoners, a larger number is hoped for.\"\nMeanwhile, the troops had begun their movements to increasingly encircle the trapped Russians.\nAround 10 a.m., a message arrived at the High Command in Osterode, dropped by an observation officer of the Field Aviation Unit 14 of the I Army Corps on the Neidenburg marketplace: A long column of all arms was advancing from Mlawa towards Neidenburg, its beginning at 9 a.m. only 6 km south of the city. The entire column was supposed to be about 36 km long! So at least an entire corps! \u2014 A telephone conversation with the General Command of the I Army Corps in Neidenburg was interrupted by Russian artillery shells hitting there. Thus, the connection to the I Army Corps was cut off for the time being.\nThe enemy defeated on August 26 and 27, perhaps reinforced by new forces, attacked again. \u2014 This impression was further reinforced by reports of strong Russian cavalry advancing against Lautenburg. They were supposed to have ambushed a German Landwehr detachment south of this place, near Zielun, and captured 11 guns; between Lautenburg and Strasburg, a Cossack squadron had occupied the Radz\u00f6c station. \u2014 In addition, shortly after the report from the I Army Corps, another report came from Field Aviation Unit 16 about a Russian advance on Ortelsburg. An infantry division from Myschyniec, a cavalry division from Friedrichshof, was observed advancing on the city. According to the timing of the report, the Russian troops could have already reached Ortelsburg. \u2014 There was no doubt anymore, on the Russian side, a large-scale relief attempt was in full swing!\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>mehr, russischerseits war ein gro\u00df angelegter Entsatzversuch in vollem Gange!</fragment_2>", "219": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"der Oberquartiermeister, Generalmajor Gr\u00fcnert, hatte die um Waplit\".

A new severe crisis had unexpectedly broken out.\nThe victory achieved could no longer be questioned, but it seemed uncertain whether its fruits could be fully reaped. The simultaneous advance of Russian troops on Neidenburg and Ortelsburg seriously threatened the circle drawn by the I and XVII Army Corps around the remnants of the Narew Army. The fight against the encircled enemy was not yet over. Airmen had observed around 5 a.m. a Russian division marching from the area of Ortul to the east, at 5 a.m. fighting north of Muschaken, and at 8 a.m. Russian artillery fire near Gregersdorf. The German encirclement troops of the I Army Corps were spread over one and a half days' marches from Neidenburg to Willenberg, while those of the XVII Army Corps, as reported by General v. Mackensen at 8 a.m., were distributed almost as widely in the area of Willenberg\u2014Ortelsburg\u2014Passenheim\u2014Jedwabno. The troops, due to the multi-day battles, must have been disorganized, weakened in number and combat strength. They were fully engaged by the encircled enemy as well as by guarding and accompanying the numerous prisoners. It therefore seemed questionable whether the I Army Corps, in particular, would be able to withstand the new strong enemy on its own.\nAt Neidenburg, at least one Russian corps had to be reckoned with, while at Ortelsburg the enemy was probably weaker. The advance on Neidenburg had the more threatening direction; through it, the I Army Corps might even be forced to retreat on August 30 to the northeast, to Jedwabno, to regroup and reorganize its forces for a new battle. On the other hand, this could develop into a favorable opportunity to intercept the Russians in the following days at Neidenburg through a comprehensive attack. Reinforcements were therefore primarily considered for a battle at Neidenburg. The XVII Army Corps had to help itself as best it could initially.\nIn this sense, the Army High Command immediately took strong measures. The deployment against the Njemen Army had to be postponed. All available forces were set in motion towards Neidenburg: the 5th Landwehr Brigade, which was already assumed to be advancing from Soldau to Mlawa, received the order to march on Neidenburg, and the Quartermaster General, Major General Gr\u00fcnert, had the fortress troops assembled around Waplit and the Landwehr Division Goltz at Hohenstein set in motion towards Guben.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>versammelten Festungstruppen und die Landwehr-Division Goltz bei Hohenstein nach Guben in Marsch zu setzen.</fragment_2>", "220": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"F\u00fcr den 30.

Apart from the troops of the I Army Corps, 4\u00bd divisions were thus concentrated against the new enemy at Neidenburg. Additionally, the 35th Infantry Division of the XVII Army Corps was to ensure security behind the I Army Corps, in case it was forced to retreat to Jedwabno.\nFor the support of the XVII Army Corps itself, only the 37th Infantry Division was available, which was marching from Hohenstein to Allenstein. It received orders to advance on Sch\u00fctzendorf (south of Passenheim). However, Lieutenant General v.

No new information about the enemy at Neidenburg and Ortelsburg was available by then. There was no connection to the general command of the I Army Corps. The news of the initiated movements had to be delivered to it by an airplane. \u2014 The army high command had thus done everything to secure itself against setbacks and, moreover, to shape the situation at Neidenburg into a new annihilation strike.

Fran\u00e7ois initially planned the 2nd Infantry Division only up to Dorf\u2014Wallendorf, and it was also to provide a regiment for the security of Neidenburg.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Dorf\u2014Wallendorf angesetzt, sie sollte au\u00dferdem ein Regiment zur Sicherung von Neidenburg stellen.</fragment_2>", "221": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Wollte man die Einschlie\u00dfung der\".

The 1st Infantry Division was to move southwards along the main road in accordance with the advance of the 2nd Infantry Division. When the air reconnaissance report came in on the evening of August 29th, indicating that a Russian column of all arms was advancing from Mlawa and had reached the Reich border south of Neidenburg, caution seemed advisable. Therefore, General v. Francois made the continuation of the pursuit objectives set in the army order of the evening of August 29th dependent on the results of the air reconnaissance directed at Mlawa.\nOn August 30th at 9:15 a.m., the expected air reconnaissance report was dropped on the Neidenburg marketplace: At least one Russian corps was advancing, and its vanguard was already directly in front of Neidenburg. The fact that the enemy suddenly appeared in such close proximity and strength was a surprise despite everything. General v. Francois did not consider the situation too serious. He did not estimate the attacking enemy's offensive power highly. He quickly decided on the most urgent orders: He wanted to continue the pursuit of the encircled Russians and simultaneously repel the new enemy. Officers in motor vehicles delivered the instructions: The forces still stationed at Neidenburg were to hold their ground south of the town, the 2nd Infantry Division was to turn south with all available units via Gregersdorf against the new enemy, and the 5th Landwehr Brigade, which might have already advanced on Mlawa, was to intervene at its own discretion either in the enemy's rear or against its flank at Kandien (south of Neidenburg). As soon as these urgent orders were given, General v. Francois moved his command post to the main road east of Gregersdorf to make further arrangements for the battle there.\nThe task that the I Army Corps initially had to solve entirely on its own was extraordinarily difficult: In front of it were the remnants of the Russian XIII and XV Corps, which were by no means defeated despite the increasing number of prisoners and booty, and in the rear, another enemy corps was advancing. The own troops, after four days of fighting, were dissolved into small detachments and, without suspecting the danger in the rear, in the full sense of victory, were moving through the large forest to the east, with the entire cavalry of the corps far ahead in this direction and unreachable. If the encirclement of the Russians was to be maintained, then only parts of both divisions of the corps could be deployed against the new enemy.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Russen aufrechterhalten, dann konnten von beiden Divisionen des Korps nur Teile gegen den neuen Feind eingesetzt werden.</fragment_2>", "222": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Generalleutnant Freiherr v. der Goltz war mit seiner schleswig-holsteinischen Landwehr-Division hinter den Festungstruppen des Generalmajors v.

By the time they brought him to a standstill, Neidenburg could have long been taken. General v. Fran\u00e7ois therefore anticipated the temporary loss of the city and sought to position his forces so that he could encircle the enemy there on August 31 from the east and west. It was only in the afternoon of August 30 that he learned that reinforcements from the army high command had also been assigned for this purpose.\nFrom midday on August 30, it gradually became possible to assemble 7 battalions and 20 batteries (including 8 heavy field howitzer batteries) from both divisions of the corps against the new enemy on the heights southwest of Gregersdorf. General Lieutenant v. Falk commanded these troops. Meanwhile, the enemy south of Neidenburg was held back by two battalions and two batteries (from Infantry Regiments 41 and 45 and Field Artillery Regiments 16 and 57) under Major Schlimm. The Russians\u00b9) proceeded very cautiously. They did not know how weak the Germans were here and developed an entire division or more under the protection of strong artillery. Thus, Major Schlimm, with his East Prussians, supported by the flanking fire of the artillery stationed at Gregersdorf, which was powerful for that time, could hold out until dusk. However, this averted any danger to the encirclement troops. Only when the small German detachment was outflanked and encircled from the west along the Neide did it retreat through Neidenburg to the north. In the darkness, parts of the Russian 3rd Guards Infantry Division occupied the city. \u2014 The intervention of the 5th Landwehr Brigade had not yet become noticeable. General Lieutenant v. M\u00fcllmann had just initiated the advance on Mlawa when he received orders from the army high command to assist at Neidenburg. It was already noon. Thus, the Landwehr could only reach the area of Gro\u00df-Roslau shortly before dusk. The attack across the Neide had to be postponed to the next morning.\nThe reinforcements assigned by the army high command also did not enter the battle on August 30: General Lieutenant Freiherr v. der Goltz had marched south with his Schleswig-Holstein Landwehr Division behind the fortress troops of Major General v.

The 3rd Reserve Division at Wuttrienen had received the order to advance so late that Lieutenant General v. Morgen postponed the start to early August 31.\nOn August 31, the enemy was to be attacked at Neidenburg from the west, north, and east. The Army High Command, through an order at 7:30 p.m., placed all units designated for the attack under General v. Fran\u00e7ois and instructed the troops of Major General v. Unger and the 41st Infantry Division\u00b9) that, unless General v.

Fran\u00e7ois until the morning of August 31. The direct connection between the Corps Command and the advancing reinforcements had already been established earlier. General v. Fran\u00e7ois wanted to lead the attack with combined force. He issued the order for this, still without knowledge of the aforementioned army order, only on August 31 at 6:00 a.m.: The 5th Landwehr Brigade was to advance east over Saberau, the Landwehr Division Goltz and the fortress troops were to bypass Neidenburg to the west towards Kandien, the 41st Infantry Division was to take Neidenburg, the 3rd Reserve Division was to attack south over Gr\u00fcnflie\u00df. The 2nd Infantry Division was then to join this division's attack from Gregersdorf.\nWhen these instructions reached the troops, the 41st Infantry Division under Major General Sonntag, which, according to the Army High Command's order, had set out early, had reached Neidenburg, but no longer encountered the enemy. Only the 5th Landwehr Brigade, which had already reached the Neide near Saberau before dawn to cross the river here, was still able to engage. Lieutenant General v.

His troops, given the difficult crossing conditions south of Saderau, were no longer able to confront the departing enemy without bridging equipment. However, the German artillery fire on the afternoon of August 30 and early August 31 had done its duty. The enemy left about 1000 prisoners and 350 dead in the hands of the victors. These were essentially the same Russian troops that had already been defeated on August 26, 27, and 28 at Seeben, Usdau, and Soldau.\nMeanwhile, fighting had also taken place behind the German XVII Army Corps. General v. Mackensen had not been entirely without concerns since turning westward due to the situation at Ortelsburg. It was on the evening of August 29 that the first clash occurred there, without the army high command initially learning of it: The commander of the 35th Infantry Division, Lieutenant General Hennig, who had driven ahead of his troops to Ortelsburg, had only narrowly escaped capture by the Russian 4th Cavalry Division, which, according to the orders of its high command, intended to retake the city ahead of the VI Corps. However, when the German Infantry Regiment 176 and simultaneously the 1st Cavalry Brigade coming from the 1st Cavalry Division arrived in front of the city, the enemy had set the place on fire and retreated southwest again. Lieutenant General Hennig had re-entered the burning city with 1 1/2 battalions.\nOn the following day, August 30, the general command of the XVII Army Corps wanted to direct all its strength against the encircled Russians. However, when General v. Mackensen learned from the army high command at 11:20 a.m. that a \"long column of all arms (infantry division)\" was marching on Ortelsburg and had presumably already reached the city, he felt compelled to detach stronger forces against this enemy. He ordered his northern 36th Infantry Division to take the front to the east to attack the new enemy on August 31. The troops of the southern 35th Infantry Division were to maintain the blockade against the encircled Russians alone and secure the connection to the I Army Corps to the south.</body>\n<footer>1) p. 209.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "225": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die Orte an der Bahn Allenstein\u2014Mehlsack\u2014K\u00f6nigsberg wurden vom deutschen Landsturm und einigen unter dem Etappen-Inspekteur, Generalleutnant v.

Russian infantry and cavalry, likely each a division strong, had encircled the city from the east and north and also deployed heavy artillery (12cm howitzers). The weak German infantry, 1<sup>1/2</sup> battalions from the 9th West Prussian Infantry Regiment No. 176, without machine guns and artillery, defended against the enemy's superiority only with difficulty. The hope for intervention by the 1st Cavalry Brigade, which had ridden back 15 km north to Mensguth the previous evening, was not fulfilled. However, unexpected help came from the southwest from the I Army Corps. The Mounted J\u00e4ger Regiment No. 10 under Lieutenant Colonel Berrings (2 squadrons, 1 battery), which had been at the forefront of its corps' pursuit since early August 29, hurried from Willenberg to assist the beleaguered comrades of the XVII Army Corps and provided the first relief. Soon after, Major General v. Hahn, who had already advanced with a pursuit detachment of the 35th Infantry Division to just in front of Willenberg and now rushed back to Ortelsburg with 3 light field howitzer batteries, joined the battle. This initially secured the possession of the city. \u2014 At noon, the Russians abandoned the fight and withdrew to the southeast and east.\nJust as at Neidenburg and Ortelsburg, the Russian advances were repelled at all other locations: between Strasburg and Lautenburg, the Radosz station had already been cleared by the Russians on the morning of August 30. Otherwise, the strong Russian cavalry had barely ventured to the border. Reports of the destruction of a German Landwehr detachment at Zielun<sup>1</sup>) turned out to be a wild rumor. This Landwehr detachment had repelled the Russian cavalry, albeit with heavy own losses, and no guns were lost. Since then, the Russian cavalry has not repeated attempts to disrupt the rear connections in this area.\nAlso, on the northern flank of the German 8th Army, the Russian cavalry divisions, which advanced over Seilsberg and Landsberg on August 30, had no success.

The\nring that surrounded them was thin. Along the 50 km stretch from Muschaken\nvia Willenberg to Jedwabno, only 29 German battalions, weakened by previous\nbattles, stood in the confusing terrain. A determined and courageous leader\nwould have had to succeed in breaking the ring and escaping with large parts.\nOn the German side, such an attempt was seriously expected. It was never\nundertaken with emphasis. Like hunted game, the Russian masses also\nbounced off small German detachments and repeatedly veered eastward,\nuntil finally, without ammunition and supplies, leaderless and completely\nexhausted, they despaired of the possibility of escape and surrendered by\nthe thousands.

Trotha, advanced north of the main road from Muschaken to the northeast with four battalions and four batteries, followed by the 3rd Infantry Brigade under Major General Mengelbier in two columns.

The already captured Russians had partially escaped but then fell into the hands of other German troops. \u2014 The German 3rd Infantry Brigade captured 2,500 prisoners.\nWhat evaded the troops of the German I Army Corps to the east was the spoil of the XVII Army Corps. The Hussar Regiment No. 5 (36th Infantry Division) in Kaltenborn had to evade the advancing Russian masses early on August 30. The enemy turned from Kaltenborn to the southeast and now moved over Wallendorf towards the blocking units of the 35th Infantry Division. At Malgaossen, 1,000 men, including a general and 16 guns, fell into the hands of the III Battalion of the 21st Infantry Regiment. Its I Battalion had meanwhile diverted the stream of fleeing Russians at Kannwiesen 1) to the south since daybreak and also captured 1,000 prisoners and two batteries. When the commander of the 70th Infantry Brigade, Major General Schmidt v. Knobelsdorf, arrived here, he ordered the advance against the Russians now retreating over Saddek to Reuschwerder. Subsequently, more Russian masses surrendered at Saddek, so that the Pomeranian Infantry Regiment von Borcke Ar. 21 captured over 12,400 men, including three generals, and 69 guns on that day.

The rest were \"close to Neidenburg, where an attack will take place tomorrow. Therefore, it is doubtful whether all can be retrieved.\" \u2014 The next day, Generaloberst v.

The bloody losses can be estimated at about 50,000 men. Of the corps of the Russian center, XIII and XV were completely, and XXIII probably almost half destroyed.

(the replacement battalions of this corps belonged to the fortress garrison); \u2014 further forces seemed to be retreating from the Njemen Army via Friedland\u2014Schippenbeil, perhaps also via R\u00f3ssel, towards the Vistula; \u2014 further south of Allenstein, the German XX Army Corps was identified, which was assumed to join the forces withdrawing to the Vistula; \u2014 finally, according to reports from the Narew Army, a strong German group seemed to be forming on its western flank: including the XVII Army Corps, as well as parts of the XIX Army Corps and the I Reserve Corps).\nGeneral Shilinski wanted to intercept the German forces marching to the Vistula, of which, after the withdrawal of the I and XVII Army Corps and the I Reserve Corps, hardly anything remained, and the XX Army Corps, securing against K\u00f6nigsberg on one side, against the German group recognized in the western flank of the Narew Army on the other. Against the large fortress of K\u00f6nigsberg, with the extensive Deime-Pregel line in front, and, as assumed, with at least one active army corps as a garrison, two corps were initially considered necessary. However, this left the Njemen Army with only two corps for the pursuit against the Vistula. They proposed a forward direction as far north as possible and the line Elbing\u2014Saalfeld as the target, while the Narew Army was to advance from the south with the strongest possible forces over Allenstein. The joint task of the 1st and 2nd Army is to push the Germans towards the sea and prevent them from withdrawing over the Vistula,\" it was said in the army group order of August 26. \u2014 The Russian Supreme Army Command approved these intentions. The Grand Duke did not want the advance of the Narew Army on Allenstein to suffer any delay, \"as this does not align with the intention to deliver a decisive blow to the Germans and thereby conclude with East Prussia.\" He wanted to shift the focus of operations to the left bank of the Vistula as soon as possible, where the appearance of German troops at Sieradz, Petrikau, and Radom had raised concerns, but where the decisive thrust deep into Germany was mainly intended.\nIn these orders, the Russian leadership was fully aware of the danger in the western flank of the Narew Army. There was an \"unquestionable superiority\" of the Germans.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>\u201eunzweifelhafte \u00dcberlegenheit\u201c der Deutschen.</fragment_2>", "230": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Seit General Samsonow an diesem Tage sein Armee-Hauptquartier von Ostrolenka nach Neidenburg\".

The reinforcement of his I Corps at Usdau ordered by General Samsonow through the 3rd Guard Infantry Division, the 1st Rifle Brigade, and the 6th and 15th Cavalry Divisions seemed sufficient as flank protection.\nIn the Njemen Army, reconnaissance increasingly showed that the German forces, assumed to be defeated and retreating westward, had gained a very large lead. Reports from the Russian cavalry, which only reached parts west of Friedland on August 27, correctly stated that today the I Army Corps had marched off to K\u00f6nigsberg, the XVII over Friedland; the marching troops could not be reached, the enemy marched off so quickly.\u201d It seems that under these circumstances and assuming that strong parts had already been shifted to the western flank of the Narew Army, a frontal pursuit was no longer promising: The advance of the Njemen Army was halted. General v. Rennenkampf now intended to also involve the other corps \u201cin cooperation\u201d in the encirclement of K\u00f6nigsberg. However, the Russian Supreme Command considered, just as it assumed the enemy did, to shift parts, perhaps even the bulk of the Njemen Army, by rail1). Thus, on August 27, it ordered the II Corps, the southernmost of the Njemen Army, to march back to Grajewo (south of Lyck) to travel by rail to Warsaw to the 9th Army. The attack prepared against L\u00f6tzen was abandoned since then. After the German commander, Colonel Busse, rejected the surrender demand sent to him on August 27, the artillery prepared against the fortress of the 2nd Army2) was returned to it by rail. The 1st Brigade of the 1st Guard Cavalry Division, which had fought on August 19 at Kraupischken and on the 26th at the Alle crossing near Friedland and apparently suffered heavily, was to be withdrawn to Kowno for replenishment.\nRegarding the unfavorable battles of the Narew Army on August 26 (south of M\u00fchlen and at Seeben\u2014Heinrichsdorf) and the simultaneous defeat of the VI Corps at Gro\u00df-Bi\u00dfau, the army group and the Supreme Command initially seemed to have learned nothing.

There is no longer any mention of the forces retreating against the Vistula. \u2014 Against three German corps, two of which were believed to have already been defeated at Gumbinnen and the third at Lahn and Orlau, General Samsonov had to appear strong enough with his five fresh active corps and three cavalry divisions alone. Thus, there were no reservations about continuing to unite all other available forces at Warsaw, in pursuit of the promises made to the French, to advance as soon as possible westward into the unprotected southern flank of the German Vistula front and against Posen.\nBy August 26, troops of the 9th Army had arrived at Warsaw and westward to W\u0142oc\u0142awek\u2014Lods, with a strength of 1 3/4 corps and 2 1/2 cavalry divisions under the commanding general of the Guard Corps, General Besobrasow. These were: the Guard Corps with the Guard Rifle Brigade, two regiments of the I Corps, 1/2 of the 59th (Reserve) Infantry Division, 5th Cavalry Division, Caucasian Cavalry Division, and Guard Cossack Brigade1). However, the I Corps intended for the 9th Army had meanwhile been transferred to the 2nd Army, the advancing XVII, and the 4th Army (Army Group of the Southwestern Front). For this, the 9th Army was now to receive the II Corps from the 1st Army and the XXII from Finland from the 6th. Furthermore, from August 29, three more corps were to arrive for the newly forming 10th Army at Warsaw: the III Siberian, I Turkestan, and II Caucasian Corps. Thus, they were in the process of assembling two armies with over six corps at Warsaw for the advance westward. These Russian plans were disrupted by the unfavorable course of the first battles against the Austrians and Hungarians in southern Poland and soon after made impossible by the defeat of the Narew Army.\nOn the evening of August 27, the army group command of the Northwestern Front was informed that the Germans had attacked at Bischofsburg, Gilgenburg, and Soldau and that the Narew Army was \"in a difficult situation.\" However, what further news the army group had at this time about the battles on August 26 and 27, we do not know.</body>\n<footer>1) = 3rd Brigade of the 1st Guard Cavalry Division. 2) See Fourth Part.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>gruppe zu dieser Zeit von den K\u00e4mpfen am 26. und 27.

Rennenkampf: \"The units that retreated from your front have been transported by rail to the front of the 2nd Army and are attacking at Bischofsburg, Gilgenburg, and Soldau. Allenstein is occupied by us. Assist the 2nd Army by advancing your left wing as far as possible against Bartenstein and your cavalry in the direction of Bischofsburg. The VI Corps has orders to advance from Szeparken\" (halfway between Bischofsburg and Ortelsburg) \"towards Passenheim.\" At the same time, the army was allowed to let the II Corps, if already directed westward, continue its march there. Thus, the transport of this corps to Warsaw was canceled. \u2014 When the orders of the army group reached the Njemen Army, the defeat of the 2nd Army at Hohenstein was just being completed. It was too late to turn it into a victory; however, with decisive measures, it might still have been possible to provide General Samsonow with relief for the retreat. But at this time, neither General Gilinski nor General v. Rennenkampf considered the situation of the Narew Army as serious as it actually became during the course of August 28.\nThus, the already not very urgent orders of the army group did not prompt the high command of the Njemen Army to act quickly. On the morning of August 28, the XX Corps, reinforced by a reserve division, including 1\u00bd cavalry divisions, was located north of the Pregel, with the III and IV Corps (along with the 5th Rifle Brigade) at Wehlau, Allenburg, and Friedland. From the cavalry corps of Khan Hussein Nachitschewanski, the 1st Guards Cavalry Division had reached Domnau to the west, and the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Divisions were at Schippenbeil. The 1st Cavalry Division was stationed at Korschen. Behind this cavalry, the II Corps, designated for rail transport to Warsaw, had received orders to retreat after having reached Rastenburg with the southern column the day before. It likely remained near Barten overnight. A brigade of the corps with artillery designated against L\u00f6tzen was still stationed east of the fortress. \u2014 Based on the army group's order, General v.

These were essentially reached during the course of August 29, but the 1st Cavalry Division only advanced as far as east of Bischofstein in the face of the opposing German cavalry.\nMeanwhile, General Samsinow had reported in detail on the morning of August 28 about the defeat of his flank corps. Consequently, the High Command of the Northwestern Front ordered the army to retreat to Ortelsburg\u2014Malwa2). Whether this order ever reached General Samsinow is uncertain. However, it seems that the army group only recognized the full extent of the danger on the night of August 29. Whether the journey undertaken by the commander-in-chief of the army group, General Schilinski, to the supreme army command in Baranowitschi on August 29 was related to this situation is unknown. The Njemen Army was now again ordered to \"advance with two corps and cavalry in the general direction, given the fierce fighting at the front of the 2nd Army.\" Soon after, the army group also learned that the Narew Army was retreating to the border. Thus, it seemed too late for support from the Njemen Army, which was itself endangered. General Schilinski ordered the recently initiated movements of their infantry to be halted.\nMeanwhile, on August 29, the encirclement of 2\u00bd corps of the Narew Army by German troops with the occupation of Willenberg was completed. This situation was reported to the army group of the Northwestern Front on the night of August 30, as German troops from Neidenburg had reached the area of Janow. The Njemen Army, which was just about to withdraw its IV and II Corps according to the last received order, now received another order to proceed. This time, however, only cavalry was to be used.

The German 8th Army would then, in all likelihood, have been pushed back against the Vistula. If it had tried to fight through the battle, a skillful Russian leadership could probably have prepared a similar fate for it as eventually befell the Narew Army itself. The Russian leadership refrained from such an exploitation of their superiority. They considered the German 8th Army defeated since Gumbinnen and since the evacuation of the Angerapp position and focused their attention more, than the situation warranted, on future operations against the German Vistula line. Neither Grand Duke Nicholas as Supreme Commander nor General Gilinski as Commander of the Northwest Front believed in a new major decisive battle east of the Vistula. They underestimated the enemy, felt secure in their confidence in their large numbers, and dispersed their forces for secondary tasks. \u2014 Thus General Samsonov stood alone at Tannenberg.\nThe Russians were not only superior to the German 8th Army in total numbers on the East Prussian theater of war, but also in the number that General Samsonov deployed in the battle itself: Five Russian corps, a rifle brigade, three cavalry divisions \u2014 all active troops \u2014 engaged here in their first battle2). On the German side, only three army corps of active troops could be opposed to them. Of these, the I Corps had lost about 3000 men in border skirmishes at Stallup\u00f6nen and Gumbinnen, but the gaps had since been filled, while the XVII Corps had been missing over 7000 men of its infantry since the Gumbinnen battle. On the German side, one corps and one division of reserve troops were available for the battle, of which the I Reserve Corps had already bled on August 20. It was missing about 2000 men. The total number of German field troops amounted to 4\u00bd corps. All others were Landwehr and non-mobile replacement troops, inadequately equipped for use in open fields. But dire necessity forced them to be deployed shoulder to shoulder with the field troops.

Since the German divisions were \u00bc inferior to the Russian ones\u00b9) and this numerical inferiority was only compensated for in the active German infantry divisions through superior artillery numbers, while this was not the case with the reserve divisions and especially not with the Landwehr and replacement troops, it becomes clear that the Russians were superior on the battlefield in infantry, cavalry, and machine guns, and only inferior in artillery.\nThe total forces opposing each other were:\n                        German              Russian\nInfantry . . . . 153 Batt.    = 144000   175 Batt.    = 175000\nCavalry . . .     58 Squad.  =   9000    99 Squad.  =  16000\nTotal . . . . .        153000                  191000\nMachine guns . . . . . . .        296                     384\nArtillery pieces . . . . . . .    728                     612\nFor a proper assessment of the strength ratios in the air, we lack knowledge of Russian capabilities. As far as we are informed, it must be assumed that the Russians were probably inferior in aircraft. They had no airships at their disposal. This undoubtedly resulted in disadvantages for reconnaissance on the Russian side. However, in assessing this, one should not apply the standards of later war years, when both German and enemy leadership relied almost exclusively on aerial reconnaissance results.\nThus, the force ratio on the battlefield itself by no means provides the explanation for the Russians' defeat, and certainly not for such a collapse as the Narew Army ultimately experienced. Various other reasons were the cause. They are only to be found in small part in the army leadership. Junior leaders and troops failed precisely at particularly important positions, on both flanks. To relieve France, the advance was rushed and undertaken partly with incomplete units.

Thus, the supply failed partially completely. The complaints of the troops about this and the suggestions of the army leader were not heard. Misjudging the situation, the higher command wanted to grant a rest day only in the Allenstein\u2014Osterode line. Thus, it became disastrous for the army that General Samsonov held firmly to the decision to attack with the right wing to the utmost. The already inevitable defeat thus became the downfall for half of his army. While on the Russian side they were occupied with far-reaching plans and thereby wasted precious time for the immediate and scattered their superiority, the German leadership, since General v. Hindenburg had taken command, initially saw only one goal, to decisively strike the Narew Army. For this, however, the last man and the last gun were brought in. Landwehr and non-mobile reserve troops were led into the field battle. They could not be strong enough for the decision and thus weakened themselves at all other points to the utmost. Thus, apart from the fortresses of K\u00f6nigsberg and L\u00f6tzen, a single cavalry division and some Landsturm battalions were all that remained against the entire Russian Njemen Army. Only because the German leadership took such a risk did they succeed in appearing in the battle itself with at least approximately equal overall strength. At the focal points of the battle, however, they even managed to secure numerical superiority.\nEven though the goal of decisively defeating the Narew Army was established, the \"how\" remained initially open. Everything was uncertain. When General Ludendorff was occasionally asked whether it was true that he had already presented a precisely developed plan for the battle to General v. Hindenburg during the first nightly lecture while traveling by train from Hanover to East Prussia, he smilingly rejected this view: \"There is no truth in that; the situation was still far too unclear and uncertain. I merely made the suggestion to General v. Hindenburg to conduct the next operation against the Russian Narew Army. From the beginning, however, there was a firm will in us to deliver a devastating blow to this army. Beyond that, no disposition could be made. It was merely a matter of ordering and doing what was appropriate from case to case. From this view, the course of the battle developed quite naturally.

Whether this idea was \nfeasible depended on the Russian Njemen Army and, since the corps of \nthe German Eastern Group marched south, on the outcome of their \nbattle against the local enemy. Thus, the Army High Command could \ninitially only strive for the destruction of Samsonov's army through an \nattack from the west. However, time and resources were insufficient to \nuse the most effective means for this, the envelopment with a strong \nsouthern wing, possibly via Soldau. Therefore, General Major Ludendorff \nproposed the attack against the front at Usdau and further towards \nNeidenburg. The battle began with a \"breakthrough\"; the attack on \nUsdau was also intended to simultaneously cut off the Russian center \nand northern wing from their rear connections. Only from the afternoon \nof August 27 did the opportunity arise to conduct their encirclement \nwith the cooperation of the Eastern Group. This opportunity was \nimmediately seized, and the encirclement, despite multiple frictions and \nmisunderstandings within the own army and despite new threats from \noutside, was brought to a brilliant conclusion in further four-day battles. \nA series of spatially and temporally separated and initially more or less \nindependently conducted victorious skirmishes, in which fighting took \nplace with the front in all directions, was ultimately shaped by the hand \nof the upper leadership into a great final success. The success of such \nan undertaking, overcoming all opposing difficulties, would not have \nbeen conceivable without the understanding initiative of all involved \nsub-leaders and the incomparable achievements of the troops. This will \nbe discussed at a later point in this book.\nThe entire six-day battle was fought under constant threat to the \nGerman right wing from Warsaw and the left by the Russian Njemen \nArmy. They only needed to advance, and the battle would have had to \nbe abandoned \u2014 perhaps with great own losses. This dangerous \nsituation has weighed heavily on the German leadership and repeatedly \nraised doubts about whether stronger forces should be withdrawn from \nthe battle to cover against Rennenkampf.\nAfter Leipzig, Metz, and Sedan, Tannenberg stands as the \nlargest encirclement battle known to world history.

The total losses amounted, including the battle at\nGumbinnen and Orlau on August 23, as far as they have been determined so far:\non the German side, a total of about 12,000 men, on the Russian side, one must\nreckon with more than ten times that number.\nWhile on the German side only about 7% of the strength of the\nfighting troops were lost, the losses on the Russian side rose to\nabout 75%. In addition, about 350 guns fell as booty, as well as an\nabundant, but no longer ascertainable number of horses, machine\nguns, field kitchens, and other vehicles of all kinds into the hands\nof the victors. This booty made it possible to significantly improve\nthe field equipment, especially of the German Landwehr and reserve\ntroops, and thereby increase their combat value.

Conrad wanted to execute the deployment in the spring of 1914 directly at the border that bulged far to the northeast. The main focus was to be in the center, near Lemberg, where the 3rd and 4th Armies were to assemble with a total of 26 divisions. From this deployment, he wanted to start the offensive with an attack of the left wing between the Bug and Vistula rivers to the north, initially to create space here and to prevent a Russian encirclement from Poland. General v. Conrad then hoped, with a favorable further course of operations, to be able to swing east with the two armies of the left wing, in conjunction with the two armies of his right wing, to throw the Russians advancing in Volhynia and Podolia and push them southward.\nAfter the murder of Sarajevo, General v. Conrad was no longer sure whether the necessary time advantage for the deployment close to the border could be achieved. Due to \"the dubious attitude of Romania and the prospect that we would be forced by diplomatic action to fully deploy against Serbia, which could then trigger Russia's intervention\"(1), he was prompted to move the Galician deployment back to the Dniester-San line during the month of July. Simultaneously with this retreat, the deployment was shifted more to the left. The right wing was to stand near Stanislau, almost 150 km from the Romanian border, the left at the mouth of the San into the Vistula. This resulted in a total front width of 270 km. A pronounced focus in the distribution of forces was no longer recognizable. The Galician capital Lemberg remained, only occupied by advance troops, in front of the front. It was to be fortified in the field during mobilization.\nGeneral v. Conrad informed the German Chief of General Staff of this final deployment plan, after the latter had informed him of details about the German eastern deployment through a letter dated August 2.\nIn the letter from Generaloberst v. Moltke, it was stated that initially 4 1/2 army corps, 3 Landwehr brigades, and 1 cavalry division would march near and east of Thorn, \u2014 furthermore 1 corps of 24 battalions [Landwehrkorps1) 2)] against Tschenstochau and Kalisch.</body>\n<footer>1) Conrad IV, p. 71.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>1 Korps von 24 Bataillonen [Landwehrkorps1) 2)] gegen Tschenstochau und Kalisch.</fragment_2>", "246": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \n\u201eDas \u00f6sterreichische Heer kann somit auf eine tatkr\u00e4ftige Unterst\u00fctzung seiner Offensive nach Ru\u00dfland durch alle im Osten Deutschlands aufmarschierenden Streitkr\u00e4fte mit Bestimmtheit rechnen.

He said the offensive with the right wing on Warsaw was intended for a much later point in the war. That he had promised such an offensive for the start of the war was unthinkable, as he was in no way authorized to do so and considered an attack deep into enemy territory before the arrival of significant reinforcements from the west to be completely out of the question.

The departure of the 3 divisions of the 2nd Army to the north was delayed far beyond August 18 and finally began only on August 30; one of the divisions even remained entirely in the Balkans. \u2014 But even from the other troops of the 2nd Army, the VII Corps was only transported to Galicia from August 22 onwards.\nThe consequence of these events was a further delay and weakening of the advance against Russia, where instead of 40\u00bd, only 37\u00bd infantry divisions were eventually deployed. The fact that Landsturm units were preferred in the first line could not compensate for this shortfall.\nThe armies deployed against Russia were directly subordinate to the Army High Command. The place of the 2nd Army, which was to form the right wing, was temporarily taken by the army group formed from parts of the future 2nd and 3rd Armies under General of Infantry K\u00f6vess von K\u00f6vessh\u00e1za. This army group was joined on the left by: the 3rd Army under General of Cavalry Ritter v. Brudermann, \u2014 the 4th under General of Infantry Ritter v. Auffenberg, the 1st under General of Cavalry Dankl \u2014 and finally, east of Kratau, an army group under General of Cavalry Ritter Kummer von Falkenfeld, which had already entered Russian territory with parts.\nEven before this advance behind the Dniester and San was completed, the armies were further moved against and across the border on the western flank by an order from August 18. The right wing, army group K\u00f6vess and 3rd Army, now advanced with its mass into the area east and north of Lemberg to hold the area around this city.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>seiner Masse in die Gegend \u00f6stlich und n\u00f6rdlich Lemberg vor, um den Raum um diese Stadt zu halten.</fragment_2>", "250": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Am 21.

Thus, the prospect of a German advance beyond Siedlce seemed to have moved into the distant future.\nThe conditions for the Austro-Hungarian offensive against Russia had turned out to be much less favorable than General v. Conrad had hoped and based his earlier calculations on. Nevertheless, he held firmly to the intention of attacking. According to his view, the attack corresponded more than the defense to the special characteristics of the Austro-Hungarian troops. He hoped that their \"tactical skill... would form a moment of superiority over the cumbersome Russian masses\"). He wanted to attack the enemy, \"so that the victorious advance of the German armies against France would not be disturbed, so that the German Eastern Army would not be isolated and exposed to a blow, finally so that Russia would not have the time to fully unite its superiority, then to use it with overwhelming force and to prepare a catastrophic defeat for the Imperial and Royal armies, which seemed quite possible if they remained in passive waiting\").\nThe initially envisaged time for the attack, August 20 or 22 (letter to General v. Moltke from August 4)), could not be met by General v. Conrad, as the assembly of his armies had not progressed far enough. They first had to close ranks and should simultaneously, especially on the western flank, gradually advance a little further. General v. Conrad believed that the general offensive of all armies could probably not begin before August 27.\nOn August 21, the Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff wrote to Generaloberst v. Prittwitz: \"We have significant Russian forces against us between the Vistula and Bug as well as east of the Bug, against which we will proceed in about a week, unless their offensive leads us to decisive battle earlier.\" This case occurred. The Russians seemed to be moving and began to cross the Galician eastern border. Based on the results, especially of aerial reconnaissance, General v. Conrad now assumed that east of the Struths only stronger cavalry with little infantry was initially to be expected. On the other hand, about 3 corps were reported advancing over Tarnopol and in Brody, and between Bug and Vistula, the flyers had already identified 12-16 Russian infantry divisions on August 27.

On the right flank, the 3rd Army was to follow them as an attached flank to the north to take over the protection against the Russian forces expected from the east. It was reinforced on August 23 by the mass of the K\u00f6vess Army Group and was to deliver a decisive blow against the enemy if they advanced further via Tarnopol and Brody.\nSince the Russians had meanwhile begun their advance along their entire front, it led to consequential battles in the following days.\nOn the Russian side, they had obtained precise knowledge of the then Austro-Hungarian deployment in 1907 and again in 1912. The Russian operational plan was based on this. The Army Group of the Southwestern Front marched against Austria-Hungary, under General Ivanov as commander-in-chief with General Alexeyev as chief of staff. General Ivanov had a total of four armies, which were comprehensively deployed east of the Vistula against Eastern Galicia, against whose northern border the 4th Army under General Baron Salzau at Lublin and the 5th under General Plehwe on both sides of the Bug, between Cholm and Kowel, \u2014 against the eastern border the 3rd under General Ruzki at Dubno and the 8th under General Brusilov at Proskurov with a special group south of the Dniester. The 46\u00bd divisions deployed against Galicia were considered sufficient to deal with the Austro-Hungarian army, especially since it was known that significant parts of this army had initially marched against Serbia. The Army Group of the Southwestern Front was to defeat the enemy with the aim of \"taking hasty forces south over the Dniester or west to Krakow.\" To this end, the 4th Army was to advance directly south to Przemysl, the 5th to the east alongside it, while the 3rd and 8th turned from the east against Lemberg and south. There was no knowledge of the change in the Austro-Hungarian deployment that General v.

At France's urging, however, the Supreme Army Command then prompted not only the Northwest Front but also the Southwest Front to attack even earlier. The Austro-Hungarian attack was expected between the Bug and Vistula. But precisely the Russian armies (4th and 5th) designated for this were numerically, especially after the loss of the XX Corps, the weakest there, as the majority of the troops had been sent from the General Government of Warsaw against Germany, and were the last to complete their deployment. Thus, the 3rd and 8th Armies in the east were now to advance as quickly as possible to push their enemy army in the rear\u00b2). \u2014 On August 18, the army group of the Southwest Front, starting from the left wing, began with the 8th, on August 19 with the 3rd Army; on August 20, both armies crossed the border. Only on August 23 did the 5th and 4th Armies advance from the north.\nThe strength of the Russian armies at the beginning of these movements is not precisely known. According to the modified deployment plan\u00b3), the following were initially determined:\nfor the 8th Army 4 active corps = 9 infantry divisions,\n\" \" 3rd, \" 5 \" = 10 \"\n\" \" 5th, \" 4 \" = 8 \"\n\" \" 4th, \" 3 \" = 6\u00bd \"\nin addition to some reserve divisions for each army, so that the Southwest Front was to count a total of 46\u00bd infantry divisions as well as 18\u00bd cavalry and Cossack divisions. However, it is certain that at this location at the beginning of operations, significant parts were still missing. Thus, the 4th Army initially did not have a single reserve division, and most of these divisions were also missing. A rough calculation based on our current knowledge of the Russian deployment shows that on August 20, no more than about 32 infantry\u2074) and 15 cavalry divisions could be available against the armies of the Danube Monarchy. In particular, the Russian 4th Army initially had at most 6\u00bd infantry divisions available.\nThe forward movement of the Austro-Hungarian western wing, where the 1st Army had immediately started with 9 infantry divisions and 1 Landsturm brigade, led to the three-day battle of Krasnik.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>krasnik.</fragment_2>", "254": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Inzwischen hatten die gegen Norden angreifenden \u00f6sterreichisch-ungarischen Armeen die Russen in ununterbrochenen K\u00e4mpfen zur\u00fcck-\"\nThis sentence appears incomplete as it ends with \"zur\u00fcck-\", suggesting it continues onto the next page.\n\n<fragment_1>Inzwischen hatten die gegen Norden angreifenden \u00f6sterreichisch-ungarischen Armeen die Russen in ununterbrochenen K\u00e4mpfen zur\u00fcck-</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"gedr\u00e4ngt: 60 km s\u00fcdlich Cholm suchte der Oberbefehlshaber der 4.

However, this defense was also to be conducted offensively. On August 25, he ordered the 1st and 4th Armies to attack northward, the 3rd to advance on Stotschow to \"decisively defeat as strong enemy forces as possible\"(2), and the 2nd to support the 3rd.\nThis concentric attack, begun with around 40 infantry divisions(3) from a front over 200 km long, led to individual battles at three spatially distant locations.

Even the intervention of reinforcements arriving gradually, especially the 2nd Army coming from the Balkans, could not change the outcome. The Russians proved superior in numbers and, particularly the Kiev troops, also in combat leadership and artillery use(4). Here, the Austrians eventually counted on 20 Russian infantry divisions. The Austro-Hungarian forces were, especially in the south, outflanked and threatened with encirclement. Their struggle ended on August 30, after five days of fighting, with the retreat to Lemberg. It was around the time when the last two expected divisions of the 2nd Army at the Balkan front had just begun loading.\nMeanwhile, the Austro-Hungarian armies attacking northward had driven the Russians back in continuous battles: 60 km south of Cholm, the commander of the 4th Army, General v.

However, his right wing was already forced to detach parts for rear cover against the Russians now advancing from the east. A gap of about 80 km in width had formed between the western wing of the 4th and the eastern wing of the 1st Army. However, the attack south of Lublin by the 1st Army had gradually stalled. The decisive turn hoped for from the intervention of the Kummer army group advancing from the west had not materialized. Although the Russians were still in the minority in terms of divisions before this army, the number of fighters on the Austro-Hungarian side had noticeably dwindled due to futile, insufficiently artillery-supported attacks.\nThus, on August 31, the Austro-Hungarian 4th and 1st Armies stood from south of Cholm to near Josefow on the Vistula with about 22 divisions over a 150 km front width in two spatially widely separated groups, without having achieved a decision, facing Russian forces that had gradually strengthened. Meanwhile, the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army was seriously endangered by the retreat of the 3rd Army. In terms of reinforcements, however, apart from the mentioned two infantry divisions of the 2nd Army, only a single Landsturm brigade was to be expected, as well as the German Landwehr Corps (2 divisions) advancing on the left wing against the Vistula, which had not yet entered the battle. General v. Conrad could no longer hope for the deployment of further forces from the Serbian front. In Vienna, strong currents were noticeable that prevented any further weakening of the Balkan front, although there, with 13\u00bd divisions (including only 3 Landsturm brigades) against 11\u00bd enemy divisions, superiority was still maintained. Thus, General v. Conrad had to rely even more on German assistance than before. Due to the absence of the 5 reserve divisions promised for East Prussia, he had already inquired on August 21. Now he also considered it urgent that the German 8th Army continue the expected advance over the Narew to Siedlce northward.

Success of the 1st Army on August 23 at Krasnik completed today. Seven divisions are retreating hastily to Lublin. ... \" According to other reports, there were said to be eight divisions, 5000 prisoners, and 60 guns captured. On August 28, General von Conrad reported: \"Our 1st and 4th Armies, after battles at Krasnik and Tomaschow, are advancing between the Vistula and Bug with stubborn fighting, while our other two armies are engaged in fierce combat east of Lemberg against a superior enemy. \u2014 It is urgently desired that strong German forces occupy the area of Siedlce and Lukow, as always expected here, so that we can hold the success at Lublin and provide support to our armies fighting east of Lemberg. There are also signs of a strengthened German proposal for an advance from Warsaw.\"\nThe German Supreme Army Command was not in a position to help immediately upon receiving this message. However, it had reinforced the army in East Prussia with two army corps, a Landwehr division, and a cavalry division, bringing it to the strength promised to the allies. The new forces, however, had only partially arrived in the East by August 28; the battle against the Russian Narew Army was still in full swing. Although there was justified hope of victory, since the first blow against the Russian Niemen Army at Gumbinnen had not succeeded, it was now very unlikely that they could turn south immediately after dealing with the Narew Army. On the other hand, the German Supreme Army Command, after receiving the Austro-Hungarian victory report a few days earlier and especially considering the strength of the Russian forces deployed against East Prussia, did not view the situation of the allies as particularly threatening. A report based on communications from the Austro-Hungarian Army High Command, by General von Freytag on August 20, had shown that by the end of August, 45 infantry divisions would be assembled on the allied side of the Galician front, compared to 34 Russian divisions that had been identified in combat, as General von Conrad had reported.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>dung des Generals v.

Conrad had communicated, 34 Russian divisions had so far been identified in combat. Even if one added a number of Russian divisions not yet identified, perhaps parity, but certainly not a significant numerical superiority of the Russians, could be assumed. The German Supreme Army Command had confidence in the Austro-Hungarian army that it was still up to this situation, especially considering that in East Prussia, small German forces were fighting with good success against a large Russian superiority, as far as was known.\nHowever, the following days clearly showed that the situation on the Galician front was developing in favor of the allied army despite everything: In the north, the desired great success was still awaited, but in the east, the Russian pressure was increasingly felt. Thus, as General v. Freytag reported to the German Supreme Army Command on August 31st, \"a prompt retreat of the 2nd and 3rd Army from Lemberg in the face of strong superiority was to be expected.\"\nAt the Austro-Hungarian Army High Command, they were already considering withdrawing the army behind the San. There, the resistance of the enemy in front of the 4th Army seemed to be weakening. The Russians began to evade the impending encirclement from August 31st: On the evening of September 1st, General v. Auffenberg reported the capture of Komarow and the victory. Several thousand prisoners and 160 guns were said to be the spoils2). At the Army High Command in Przemysl, the situation was viewed more confidently again. The victory in the north could also restore the situation at Lemberg. General v. Conrad was immediately determined to let only small parts of the victorious 4th Army follow the retreating enemy north; their main force should turn around and, advancing south, now also turn the battle at Lemberg to victory.\nNevertheless, German support remained urgently desired. Since in Przemysl, knowledge of the transport of German forces from the west to East Prussia had been received, it was hoped that after the German victories in France and East Prussia, direct support by German troops in Galicia would now also be possible.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>nach Ostpreu\u00dfen Kenntnis erhalten hatte, hoffte man, da\u00df nach den deutschen Siegen in Frankreich und in Ostpreu\u00dfen nun auch eine unmittelbarbare Unterst\u00fctzung durch deutsche Truppen in Galizien m\u00f6glich sein werde.</fragment_2>", "258": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"mit der unsere Armeen verfu\u00dften,\".

Fleischmann,\nthe liaison officer with the German 8th Army, brought a new disappointment.\nThe report stated: General v. Hindenburg now wants to initially break off\nthe race battle. \"Thus, again \u2014 apparently triggered by a misunderstood\nimperial telegram after the victory in East Prussia \u2014 the view has taken\nhold that the favorite province of East Prussia must first be completely\ncleared of the enemy. . . . However, the weak Russian Niemen Army\nwould retreat \"without resistance in a timely manner\" before the arrival\nof the German Army. Such thought processes corresponded entirely to the\nview that the Austro-Hungarian Army High Command had also formed\nabout the German conduct of the war in the East, since Generaloberst\nv. Prittwitz had not immediately advanced south in mid-August, but first\nagainst the Niemen Army. The leading military positions of Austria-Hungary,\nespecially General v. Conrad himself, harbored the suspicion and openly\nexpressed it among themselves even then, that the German Army Command\nwas conducting the war in the East based on self-serving considerations\nand thereby neglecting the common cause, thought processes that had not\neven remotely occurred to the German leadership at that time and were\ntherefore neither understood nor considered.\nOn September 3, Archduke Friedrich, as the supreme commander of the\nAustro-Hungarian Army, addressed the German Emperor directly: \"In\nfulfillment of our alliance obligations, we have, by abandoning East Galicia,\nthus guided only by operational considerations, seized the offensive in the\nagreed direction between the Bug and Vistula and thereby drawn the\noverwhelming power of Russia onto us, with which our armies are engaged,\nbut stubbornly striving for success, which was also granted to them in the bloody battles of Krasnik, Samostje\u00b9), and Komarow, albeit at the expense of the eastern army groups, which could therefore only be weaker and were pushed by the superior enemy.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>aber hartn\u00e4ckig um den Erfolg ringen, der ihnen in den blutigen Schlachten von Krasnik, Samostje\u00b9) und Komarow auch hier zuteil wurde, allerdings auf Kosten der \u00f6stlichen Armeegruppen, welche deshalb nur schw\u00e4cher sein konnten und vom \u00fcberlegenen Feind gedr\u00e4ngt wurden.</fragment_2>", "259": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Trotzdem hatte die Auffassung des Grafen Schlieffen noch\".

We have found it difficult that the agreed German offensive over the lower Narew, towards Siedlce, did not take place. If the great goal of defeating Russia is to be achieved, I consider a vigorously conducted German offensive with strong forces in the direction of Siedlce to be decisive, but also urgent; apart from that, it seems to me that after the brilliant and decisive German successes in France, the moment has come in which the powerful support of the Austro-Hungarian operations by German troops, promised under this condition, must be realized ...\"\nThe seriousness of the situation on the Galician front was highlighted by the simultaneous reports of the German general at the Austro-Hungarian army high command: The fortified city of Lemberg had to be abandoned and the 2nd and 3rd armies were withdrawn further west, behind the Grodeker lakes. If the intended thrust of the 4th army to the south did not succeed, General v. Conrad wanted to withdraw all armies to the fortress of Przemysl and the San. Lieutenant General v. Freytag remarked that, in his opinion, \"due to a strong loss of business strength, a transition to a firmer defense seems advisable.\" The allied Danube monarchy was also in a difficult position on other fronts: After no success had been achieved against the Serbs, there was the possibility that they would now go on the offensive themselves. The Romanians were not trusted, the Tsar was said to have offered them Bukovina. That Turkey was now increasingly leaning towards the side of the Allies could bring only slight relief in such a situation. The Austro-Hungarian chief of staff wished for their intervention over the Black Sea against Odessa as well as in the Caucasus.\nFor the German supreme army command, however, the decisive question remained what could be done on their part to support the allied empire. It was not only Austro-Hungarian concerns that were decided in Galicia, but equally German ones. A Russian advance on Vienna also threatened Silesia, gave the Western powers new hope, and thus strengthened their resistance. Nevertheless, the view of Count Schlieffen still held full validity: even the fate of Austria would not be decided on the Bug, but on the Seine.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) West of Komarow.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>volle G\u00fcltigkeit: auch das Schicksal \u00d6sterreichs w\u00fcrde nicht am Bug, sondern an der Seine endg\u00fcltig entschieden werden1).</fragment_2>", "260": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die ung\u00fcnstige Auffassung des Generals v.

However, the decision had not yet been made there. The transfer of the two corps to East Prussia had already proven to be probably premature. All the more, the Supreme Army Command could not think of further weakening the Western Army.\nBut even an advance from East Prussia to Siedlce was not yet possible despite the victory at Tannenberg. The Russian Narew Army had been decisively defeated, and what had escaped to Poland was so weakened by the defeat that the way to Warsaw, but also east past it, was open as long as the Russians did not bring in new troops. The resistance at the Narew Line, built in peacetime, might not have been too stubborn under these circumstances. However, in further advances, the major military sites of Nowogeorgiewsk and Warsaw on the western flank, the heavily fortified Osowiec and Brest-Litovsk, as well as four double-track railways leading from the interior of Russia in the east, were commanded. And in the rear, the Rennenkampf army was simultaneously defeated, reinforced by new forces and therefore numerically superior to the German 8th Army \u2014 even after the arrival of the German corps rolling in from the west. This Russian army only needed to advance, then the operation over the Narew would collapse. However, keeping the Russian Njemen Army in check and simultaneously conducting a far-reaching offensive to the south in other areas exceeded the strength of the victors of Tannenberg.\nThus, the next goal of the German operations in the east could only be the destruction of the Njemen Army; only then did an advance far to the south, towards the allies, have a prospect of success. The German Supreme Army Command and the command of the 8th Army were already in agreement on this view. In this sense, the Austro-Hungarian Army Command was also answered. The armies of the Danube Monarchy had to rely on their own strength and the German Landwehr Corps for the time being. In doing so, there was full confidence in the victories of the allied 1st and 4th Armies and the further operational intentions of General v. Conrad. The unfavorable view of General v. Freytag regarding the condition of the Austro-Hungarian troops receded into the background, especially since the Battle of Tannenberg had just proven what could be achieved against Russian troops even with minorities.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>soeben erwiesen hatte, was gegen russische Truppen auch mit Minderheiten zu erreichen war.</fragment_2>", "261": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Auch hoffte man zu dieser Zeit noch, in\".

The Russian Supreme Command until Early September.\n(Map 1 and Sketch 9, p. 267.)\nThe Russian Supreme Command, as mentioned, had pursued a threefold goal from the outset. On one hand, it wanted to overthrow Austria-Hungary's army, simultaneously conquer East Prussia, and also prepare an attack \"deep into Germany.\" For this attack, they wished to gain control of the Vistula front Danzig\u2014Thorn before the German western armies could intervene in the east. The need to quickly achieve a decisive success increased with the victories of the Germans in France. Thus, the Grand Duke repeatedly urged both the army group of the Northwest Front and that of the Southwest Front to act swiftly and decisively.\nFor the attack against Germany on the left bank of the Vistula, the 9th Army gathered near Warsaw, and the deployment of the 10th was to follow. The Supreme Command held on to the determination of the Warsaw forces against Germany as long as possible. However, as they gradually advanced the army division Kummer, they gained the impression that the Austro-Hungarian deployment was more shifted to the west compared to the plan of 1912, and this circumstance, along with the approach of the German Landwehr Corps, raised concerns for the western flank of the Southwest Front. Nevertheless, the Chief of the General Staff sharply rejected on August 22, a day before the 4th Army east of the Vistula began its attack southward, using parts of the 9th Army arriving in Warsaw for their protection. This army was to maintain its offensive task against Germany. Forces that had previously been designated for the left wing of the Southwest Front, especially the III Caucasian Corps, were moved to the area of Ivangorod.\nSoon, however, they found themselves compelled to release parts of the 9th Army for other purposes: The I Corps had to be transferred to the 2nd Army for cover against Thorn, and the XVIII on August 25 was diverted to the 4th Army to repel the Austro-Hungarian attack southward. Corps following from the Asian territories of the Empire were to cover the shortfall. At this time, they also hoped to quickly finish in East Prussia.</body>\n<footer>1) Reference p. 36. \u2014 2) Tichowitsch, p. 50.\n3) Notes of the Quartermaster General Danilow (Tichowitsch, p. 55).\n4) Tichowitsch, p. 50. \u2014 5) pp. 68 and 122.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Ostpreu\u00dfen rasch fertig zu werden.</fragment_2>", "262": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Am 2.

Since August 26, the Supreme Command\nhad been considering the (already mentioned) idea of moving the bulk of the\n1st Army by rail via Warsaw to the western Vistula bank. Even on August 28,\nGeneral Quartermaster Danilow responded in this sense to the objections of the\nNorthwest Front: \"It is impossible to leave nine corps on the right Vistula bank\nwhile the entire weight of further operations lies on the left bank.\" The news of\nthe unfavorable situation at the 2nd Army initially ended this idea. The Supreme\nCommand did not assume on August 29 either that a disaster of decisive\nimportance could occur there*).\nAt the same time, the difficult situation between the Vistula and Bug,\nwhere the 4th and 5th Armies were pressed by a superior enemy, ruled out\nfurther holding back of strong forces near Warsaw. It was considered to\nlaunch these units, whose vanguard of the 2nd Guards Infantry Division\nhad already reached Petrikau, to attack on the left Vistula bank southwards,\nvia Radom. The Northwest Front reported on August 28 that 48 battalions\nwould be available for this.

Further movement of the 8th Army is, if the situation in East Prussia permits, envisaged in the direction of Warsaw.\"\nThis \"cleansing of East Prussia\" was not meant purely locally. It was not enough to chase the enemy across the border; he had to be, if possible, destroyed, or at least so defeated that the German 8th Army gained full freedom of movement for further operations. This was also how Generaloberst von Hindenburg and Generalmajor Ludendorff understood the task. To achieve this result, it was necessary, given the strength of the Russian Njemen Army, to bring in all available forces. The troops rolling in from the west1), the Guard Reserve Corps (this, unlike other reserve corps, with an active division and otherwise in its strength completely equal to an active corps), the XI Army Corps, and the 8th Cavalry Division brought a reinforcement for the army by almost half.

These remnants of the army had been in full retreat southward against the fortified Narew line since August 31. After suffering a heavy defeat, they initially could not possess any significant offensive power.\nThe Russian 1st (Njemen) Army, on the other hand, was to be regarded as a fully capable opponent. In recent days, newly formed reserve divisions, rolling into the deployment area after the old troops, had been identified. By early September, reports of three such divisions were available, so that the army as a whole comprised at least 11\u00bd infantry and 5\u00bd cavalry divisions: II, III, IV, XX Corps, 5th Rifle Brigade, 53rd, 56th, 57th Reserve Division, 1st Guard, 2nd Guard, 1st, 2nd, 3rd Cavalry Division, 1 independent Cavalry Brigade.\nThe presence and arrival of further Russian forces were expected. The Germans primarily considered the Guard Corps, which had already been accepted by the Njemen Army on August 20/21, then apparently transferred to Warsaw, but had not yet been felt at the front. Furthermore, the XXII Corps from Finland, which had wanted to move southwest via Petersburg for several days, was also considered, as well as the XVIII Corps from Petersburg and further reserve divisions. According to the German Supreme Army Command, five more were expected in addition to the three previously reported. According to intelligence reports, it was assumed that these and possibly other reinforcements would primarily serve the formation of a reserve army at Grodno. Overall, excluding the remnants of the Narew Army, a probable Russian strength of twenty infantry divisions was estimated, which had to be fought on the East Prussian front.\nThus, the numerical ratio was no longer as unfavorable as before, but it still had to be considered that over \u00bc of the German forces consisted of Landwehr, which could not be fully counted for field warfare, and that the Russian infantry divisions were \u2153 stronger than the German ones. Also, since facing Rennenkampf's army in the Battle of Gumbinnen, the German troops had no greater amplitude immediately behind them; only the cut-off corps had suffered little so far.

The 1st Cavalry Brigade (from the 1st Cavalry Division) had reached Myschlinje. At L\u00f6\u00dfn, where all positions had remained in German hands during the Battle of Tannenberg, the enemy had held back since their unsuccessful surrender demand on August 27. In the early days of September, German Landsturm from the fortress had reoccupied the barriers in the Johannisburg Heath and driven back positions of the Russian 16th Infantry Division (VI Corps) from retreat. Nikolaiken was also back in German possession. Enemy from the Russian 43rd Infantry Division (from II Corps) was still observing east of L\u00f6\u00dfn. \u2014 The German 1st Cavalry Division (without 1st Brigade) faced far superior Russian cavalry at Lautern, while Russian reconnaissance units were skirting around Bischofstein into their rear towards Wartenburg. There, on the orders of the Army High Command, the I Reserve Corps had advanced a detachment. \u2014 North of Guttstadt over Wormditt\u2014Mehlsack\u2014Zinten to south of K\u00f6nigsberg, only a few battalions of stage and fortress troops, mostly Landsturm, were stationed for concealment. The strong Russian cavalry had retreated everywhere to the east since August 31. \u2014 The governor of the K\u00f6nigsberg fortress, Lieutenant General v. Pappritz, had launched a successful advance over the Deime on September 1, but had since held back his forces more on the orders of the Army High Command, in accordance with the overall situation. The enemy was in the forest area of the Frisching and on the east bank of the Deime.\nThe task was to attack the Russian Njemen Army. Since the defeat of the Narew Army, it had retreated to the area northwest of the Masurian Lakes and was now four strong day marches in front of the German 8th Army's front. General v. Rennenkampf appeared to be preparing for stubborn defense. His position found secure support in the north at the Rautische Haff. The southern flank was bent back and protected by the Mauer Lake on the flank. What Russian forces were still east or south of the Masurian Lakes or advancing was beyond the knowledge of the German command. To decisively strike an enemy in such a position, as General v.

If one wanted to gain the flank here, one first had to penetrate deeply between the Pregel and the lagoon. Only then could one turn south. However, the road conditions from the Tapiau\u2014Labiau line were extremely unfavorable, and the Pregel had to halt the exploitation of success. Here, too, one encountered the already far-advanced Russian northern flank, not the depth of the Russian rear connections. The defeated enemy would have been pushed back in the direction of these.\nThe situation of the Russian army was much more unfavorable if it was possible to encircle their southern flank. It was already somewhat set back. If one advanced here, one would cut the rear connections of the Russians and could push them north against the Njemen. This solution promised a decisive success. One could swing out over L\u00f6tzen or also south of the lakes, while the enemy was tied down in the front by attack. Such an operation seems simple today, yet it required particularly bold daring. In view of the opponent, the German leader had to divide his forces.\nThe Russians could exploit this situation for a blow: The emergence of the German encircling wing from the narrows of Ailolaiten and L\u00f6tzen and its further advance in the difficult lake terrain east of these narrows could only be delayed with inferior forces; but if the Germans swung south of the great lakes over Johannisburg, their path would become even longer, the time of separation from the parts deployed against the Russian front even longer. At the same time, however, the danger grew that significant parts of the encircling troops would be attacked by new Russian forces from the Lomsha\u2014Ostrow\u2014Grodno line and withdrawn from the decision. Viewed from this perspective, the decision-seeking German southern flank could not be strong enough.\nOn the other hand, the parts deployed north of the great lakes were expected to face the Russian superiority alone for several days. From L\u00f6tzen to the area east of Angerburg is 25 km, a full day's march, from Johannisburg to Goldap almost 100 km. Even if the advance on these long stretches suffered no significant delay by the enemy, several days had to come for the army command: If General v. Rennenkampf forced the separation of the German army and himself advanced north of the lakes with full force, he could bring the victorious army into a bad situation. Given everything known about Russian warfare, their behavior in the East Asian war, and General v. Rennenkampf's previous actions in East Prussia, and especially after the recent destruction of the Narew Army, it was not very likely that the Njemen Army would now decide to launch an early and effective counterattack from its strong position, with the fortress of K\u00f6nigsberg on its northern flank, at the right moment; but it remained possible.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>", "269": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Es war beabsichtigt, den rechten Fl\u00fcgel des I.

The attacked front was already very wide in relation to the available forces. \u2014 The 1st Cavalry Brigade was to continue independently reconnoitering south of the lakes over Rudzanny. The 1st Cavalry Division (without the 1st Brigade) was to obscure the advance of the right army wing, with the 8th Cavalry Division moving up to it after unloading.\nWhile all previous reports from the enemy had only indicated defense and fires and destroyed bridges marked the path of his retreat, this picture changed after the issuance of the army order on the evening of September 3: The K\u00f6nigsberg government reported Russian preparations for bridge strikes over Pregel and Deime, enemy forces were advancing from Allenburg to the northwest. The government expected a Russian attack. An intercepted radio message also made the enemy's transition to attack seem not excluded.\nThe army high command began to pay more serious attention to this possibility and even temporarily considered on September 4 that a battle could occur west of the lakes. The corps were instructed to close ranks during the transition to rest to be ready for battle at any time. They prepared to, if necessary, lead the XVII, and even the I Army Corps, north on the west side of the lakes. Only the 3rd Reserve Division remained available for use east of the lakes. On September 4, it received the order to advance from Myschinje towards the town of Johannisburg, which had meanwhile been reoccupied by Landsturm. The 1st Cavalry Brigade was subordinated to the division.\nBy September 5, all parts of the army had reached the objectives assigned to them in the army order of the 3rd, partly \u2014 in accordance with later instructions from the army high command \u2014 had even surpassed them.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>des Armee-Oberkommandos entsprechend \u2014 auch schon \u00fcberschritten.</fragment_2>", "271": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Das XVII.

Then a new enemy appeared from the southern flank, especially from Lomsha: The militia in Johannisburg reported on September 5 in the morning the advance of a long column from Kolno to the north and also enemy troops just east of Johannisburg on the road to Bialla. Residents had reported that \"three Russian army corps\" were gathering at Kolno, and Russian troops were supposed to be in Arys and Lyck. A verification of these perhaps exaggerated reports by reconnaissance could not be carried out immediately due to the weather.\nHowever, there was no sign of any action by the Rennenkampf army for the time being; they seemed to continue to behave cautiously. On the evening of September 4, flyers had identified the Russian positions in the line: lakes west of Angerburg\u2014Gerdauen\u2014Allenburg in all details. The Russian cavalry retreated to these positions without a fight, even behind the front at Angerburg. The enemy's main forces still seemed to be standing between the lakes and the Pregel and were being further reinforced here. According to residents' reports, a long column of all arms was supposed to have marched from Lyck to Angerburg in recent days, while at the Deime the last active Russian division (28th from the XX Corps) seemed to be relieved by the 53rd Reserve Division advancing from Tilsit.\nBy September 5, however, the German troops had already advanced so close to the lake line that it had to be decided whether, in view of the superior enemy in the front and the new enemy on the flank, the separation of their own army should be risked. Since it offered the most effective means to decisively defeat the Njemen army, the army high command did not hesitate to accept the risks associated with it.\nColonel General v. Hindenburg deployed the 3rd Reserve Division (including the 1st Cavalry Brigade) and the southern division of the I Army Corps (1st Infantry Division) east of the lakes, the other division of this corps (2nd Infantry Division) on the crossing of Niborkallen and also subordinated the 3rd Reserve Division to the commanding general of the I Army Corps. To what extent these three divisions strong combat group would be withdrawn by the enemy in the south could not yet be foreseen. The goal remained to turn their entire force sharply north east of the lakes.\nThe XVII Army Corps was to continue advancing against L\u00f6tzen on September 6, to move through the fortress to the east or also, if General v. Rennenkampf still went on the offensive, to attack west of the lakes to be further advanced northward.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>der Seen nach Norden weitergef\u00fchrt zu werden.</fragment_2>", "272": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Feind aller Waffen von unbekannter St\u00e4rke, dabei 8 schwere, 11 leichte Ge-\".

However, the bulk of the K\u00f6nigsberg forces seemed to be tied up near the fortress itself due to the possibility of a Russian attack. For the army cavalry, the space between the enemy position and the advancing own army had become increasingly narrow. If there was no longer a battle west of the lakes, then the 1st Cavalry Division was to follow the XVII Army Corps via L\u00f6tzen to ride into the enemy's flank once this corps had opened the way. By then, the 8th Cavalry Division could also be on the move, which was now only gathering at its foremost unloading point Mchrungen. From here it had almost 140 km to cover to L\u00f6tzen.\nThe news of the Russians advancing from Kolno had turned out to be false by the evening of September 5th. Aerial reconnaissance revealed early on September 6th that everything was calm at the Narew as well. Only smaller camps east of Prasnysz and those of one division each at Ostrolenka and Lomsha had been identified. On the other hand, troops seemed to have arrived at the border station Grajewo, advancing west over Schtschutschin\u2014Bialla towards Johannisburg. Overall, it was likely at least one division, with one brigade still at Grajewo itself. South of this advance and east to Lyk and Arys, all roads were reported clear. Larger Russian formations were thus not initially advancing against the German encircling wing. It was hoped to still be able to bring it into full strength north for deployment. However, it was necessary to push new forces from the west. The army command had to further weaken the southern front. The 70th Landwehr Brigade was to move to Myschyniec, the Landwehr Division Gold to gather its troops by rail and march to Rudczanny and follow the southern wing of the army via Johannisburg.\nMeanwhile, at Johannisburg on the evening of September 5th, the first contact with the new enemy had occurred. \u2014 On September 6th, the Russians attacked the place and, in parallel, the parts of the I Army Corps advanced there, including the 1st Cavalry Brigade and Landsturm, to retreat. The vanguard of the 1st Infantry Division under Major General Paschen restored the situation on the evening of September 6th: \"Enemy of all arms of unknown strength, including 8 heavy, 11 light guns,\" as the I Army Corps reported in the evening, \"was retreating eastwards to Bialla.\"</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>sch\u00fctze\u201c war, wie das I.

General v. Francois had assigned the 3rd Reserve Division advancing south of Johannisburg for September 7. A favorable further development on this battlefield seemed secured. Further north, the 2nd Infantry Division had reached Niktolainen and begun constructing a crossing1). The XVII Army Corps, marching in a column, had reached the beginning of Rhein, with its cavalry extending beyond to Kulla Bridge (10 km south of L\u00f6tzen).\nAs the enemy in the north remained calm, a battle west of the lakes was no longer expected. Thus, the march through the lake area was planned for the coming days. If the enemy east of L\u00f6tzen seemed weak, he had already been in front of the fortress for two weeks, having had time to fortify thoroughly. Flyers had identified fortifications at the narrows west of Arys, then from Pammen (24 km southeast of L\u00f6tzen) to Goldapgar Lake, and between this and Mauer Lake. Resistance was expected along this extensive line. To overcome it, all available forces east of the lakes were to cooperate. Therefore, the army command ordered the 3rd Reserve Division to advance north over Bialla\u2013Drygallen on September 7. The I Army Corps was to proceed on Arys\u2013Widminnen, facilitating the XVII by advancing parts into the area southeast and south of L\u00f6tzen. Additionally, this corps was to gain the heights 6 km northeast of L\u00f6tzen; further action was expected only when the I Army Corps and the 3rd Reserve Division had reached the same level.\nOn September 7, Lieutenant General v. Morgen with his 3rd Reserve Division unexpectedly struck the enemy's flank at Bialla at noon, whom the vanguard of the 1st Infantry Division had hindered the day before and now attacked again with advanced parts from Johannisburg. Parts of the Russian 1st and 3rd Finnish Rifle Brigade (from the XXII Corps) were thrown northeast after a short battle, 400 prisoners and 8 guns fell into the hands of the 3rd Reserve Division, which rested at Bialla after the day's exertions. \u2014 From the I Army Corps, the 1st Infantry Division advanced in the evening to the well-known troop training grounds south of Arys against the enemy, but had to postpone the attack to the next day due to the onset of darkness.</body>\n<footer>1) The two bridges present there in peacetime had to be blown up during the German retreat in August.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Ar\u00ffs auf Gegner, mu\u00dfte den Angriff aber der einbrechenden Dunkelheit halber auf den n\u00e4chsten Tag verschieben</fragment_2>", "274": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die Division sollte tief in des Feindes R\u00fccken die Bahn Marggrabowa\u2014Goldap unterbrechen, im \u00fcbrigen vor allem die russischen Kolonnen und Trains \u201eunbeweglich machen\u201c.

In front of them, however, there seemed to be only a weak enemy, perhaps just a single brigade of the Russian 43rd Infantry Division. It was urgent to take advantage of the favorable situation and reunite the army, now spread over 140 km of front width, for decisive battle. Concerns about the rear and flank of the advance had to take a back seat. Everything was quiet at the Narew, and the entire Russian XXII Corps seemed to be unloaded at Grajewo. Thus, stronger Russian forces were expected to appear from this direction, but they probably came too late to change the decision. Therefore, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg did not want to leave anything against them from the five German divisions set for encirclement; the goal of these German forces lay in the north, and they were to advance there as fully and as quickly as possible, so that the enemy had no time to reconsider. The Landwehr Division Goltz advancing over Rudzanny had to take on the security against the Grajewo enemy alone. At worst, it could also retreat northward in the further course of the operation and base itself on Ar\u00ffs.\nOn September 8, the I Army Corps was to advance with the 3rd Reserve Division against the railway line Lyck\u2014L\u00f6tzen towards Neu-Jucha and westward, while the XVII Army Corps was to turn north from L\u00f6tzen. This would successively flank and make untenable the Russian defensive positions east of the lakes; the way for the army cavalry was also cleared. The 1st Cavalry Division (without the 1st Brigade located with the 3rd Reserve Division) was subordinated to the XVII Army Corps for September 8, which had to lead it early over L\u00f6tzen. The division was to deeply disrupt the railway Marggrabowa\u2014Goldap in the enemy's rear, and otherwise primarily \"immobilize\" the Russian columns and trains.

After the preceding marches on poor sandy roads (covering 100 km from Willenberg along the border to Bialla from September 5th to 7th) and following the battle on September 7th, the division needed rest so much that Lieutenant General v. Morgen only allowed them to set out on the afternoon of September 8th. The division reached Drygallen (9 km north of Bialla) that day without encountering the enemy and halted there to remain on the flank of a new enemy reported advancing from Juch to the west. This enemy occupied the narrow pass of Klaussen on the Lyck\u2014Arrys road in the evening. The German I Corps drove the enemy from Arrys early on September 8th, capturing 1000 prisoners and advancing halfway to the day's designated march goal of Widminnen. The 2nd Infantry Division reached the railway between Widminnen and L\u00f6tzen after minor skirmishes with parts of the Russian 43rd Infantry Division.\nWhile the I Corps had not yet faced any significant enemy, the XVII Corps had to anticipate encountering fortified enemy positions from north of Widminnen to Lake Goldapgar and between Lake Goldapgar and Lake Mauer on September 8th. Intercepted radio messages suggested that only the Russian 43rd Infantry Division, perhaps not even fully, was opposing them. However, reconnaissance revealed such strength in the enemy's garrison and fortifications that a planned attack seemed necessary. General v. Mackensen initially deployed the 35th Infantry Division, reinforced by a detachment from L\u00f6tzen (1 battalion, 3 batteries), south of Lake Goldapgar against the position at Kruglanken, and the 36th Infantry Division northwest of the lake against Possessern. By the evening of September 8th, the corps' infantry had advanced to within 800\u20131000 meters of the Russian positions, partly under heavy enemy shrapnel fire. The assault was scheduled for the next morning at 4 o'clock. On the right flank of the XVII Corps, the 1st Cavalry Division was positioned at Kruglanken, and the 8th had moved into the area between L\u00f6tzen and Rhein.\nMeanwhile, north of the lakes, the German corps had also deployed for an attack against the Russian positions: on September 6th, 8\u00bd divisions had stretched across nearly 70 km of front line from R\u00f6\u00dfel to Bartenstein to Preu\u00dfisch-Eylau.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>stein\u2014Preu\u00dfisch-Eylau erreicht.</fragment_2>", "276": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Andererseits aber wollte man auch im Norden festgestellten feindlichen\".

They were still 40 km from the Russian lines. On September 7, the German left wing was to be extended another 20 km north with the arrival of the P\u00f6sener main reserve. Contact with enemy advance troops was expected for this day. For the 8th, the army command anticipated the initiation of the frontal battle, and the encirclement group could make itself felt at the earliest on the 9th. Until their intervention, the corps deployed against the front were on their own.\nThe enemy stood, as the messages gradually received from the troops and agents and intercepted radio messages indicated, with strong forces, of which 10 1/2 divisions were reliably identified, north of the lakes: starting from Angerburg, the II Corps (without 1/2 or entire 43rd Infantry Division), the IV with the attached 57th Reserve Division, the III, including the 5th Rifle Brigade, and finally the XX with the attached 53rd and 56th Reserve Divisions. In addition, there were still 5 1/2 cavalry divisions and, as assumed, also further reserve divisions to be reckoned with. The enemy was thus estimated to have at least 176 battalions in the front, against which, including Landwehr, at most 132 German battalions stood. In artillery, especially heavy, the Russians could have supplied themselves from their fortresses Grodno and Kowno. Thus, serious battles were expected for the frontal attack, which the army command faced with some concern: Despite the brilliant successes of Tannenberg, there was still no experience in attacking fortified positions, as had to be expected from an enemy who had shown himself a master in the construction and defense of such positions in Manchuria and who had now had almost two weeks to prepare. This concern was reinforced by aerial reports received on the evening of September 7, which depicted a deep echelon behind the Russian northern wing, in total about three corps, on both sides of the Pregel back to Insterburg. Even if the strengths might have been exaggerated, these reserves still indicated the great numerical superiority of the enemy. His distribution of forces seemed to allow him to conduct an overwhelming attack on the German northern wing. Thus, pressure was still in place on the northern wing.\nThis suspicion led the army command to intend to first make the encirclement movement effective, but to approach the Russian positions in the front only slowly. On the other hand, they also wanted to pin down the enemy reserves identified in the north there, so that they would not be shifted south against the German attacking wing.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>Reserven dort fesseln, damit sie nicht nach S\u00fcden gegen den deutschen Angriffsfl\u00fcgel verschoben wurden.</fragment_2>", "277": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Gegen diesen Ort wurden das XI.

In the army order for\nthat day it said: \"Should the enemy take the offensive, the\ncorps are to hold the line reached.\" For their own safety and to\ntie up the Russian reserves, more troops for the northern\nwing would have been urgently desired. Apart from the main reserve from Posen,\nno significant reinforcements were available. The\narmy command considered bringing in parts from the East Prussian eastern front.\nBut everything there was in flux to the east, the flank\nwas getting longer every day, there was nothing free. The government of\nK\u00f6nigsberg was ordered to push stronger forces than before for use south of the Pregel.\nBut no more than at most 1\u20132 brigades could be counted on.\nSo the army command resorted to a ruse: On the morning of September 7, it had the K\u00f6nigsberg radio station\nopenly give the following radio message: \"General Command Guard\nCorps, hurry, urgent. \u2014 Guard Corps closes hard west of\nLabiau by tomorrow. \u2014 Unloaded parts of the V Army Corps . . .\" (followed by a\nseries of random letters) \"...

In the south,\nimmediately north of Lake Mauer, where it was necessary to support the attack of the\nencircling group, it was to be tackled only when\nthis group itself was close enough; before that, it could only reveal the intention\nand cause the enemy to strengthen their southern wing.\nJust north, the protruding corner of the Russian position at\nGerdauen was to form a suitable attack point. On the other hand, at\nRastenburg, given the own limited forces and the strong Russian reserves reported there,\nrestraint seemed advisable.\nAccordingly, the army command held back the southernmost, XX Army Corps for September 8.\nIts right wing division (41st) was to stand ready at Rastenburg to\nfollow the XVII Army Corps via L\u00f6ben or also to be used in a northern\ndirection, the other was to initially cover the flank of the\nattack on Gerdauen.

They were to advance by noon on September 8, taking the Russian positions up to a line about 6 km from the Omulef. From there, the commanding general of the XI Army Corps, General of Infantry v. Pl\u00fcskow, was to direct the further offensive movement for both corps so that the artillery battle against the main Russian position could begin early on September 9. The northern flank of this attack was to be covered by echeloning along the Gerdauen\u2014Friedland road. The Guard Reserve Corps, with the main reserve Posen (9 battalions, 1 squadron, 8 batteries) advancing from their unloading points, was ordered on September 8, \"in anticipation of an enemy attack,\" to halt on both sides of Friedland on the road leading from Gerdauen via Friedland to Tapiau, and to attack on both sides of Allenburg only on September 9.\nThese movements were carried out as planned on September 8, with Russian advance troops retreating to the main position without significant resistance. Favorable reports on the advance of the I Army Corps on the outer flank of the encirclement, while the XVII Army Corps faced strong enemy forces directly, made it no longer seem expedient to push the 41st Infantry Division over L\u00f6ben. The entire XX Army Corps therefore received orders in the morning to advance further north of the lakes, thereby directly supporting the XVII Army Corps. As a result, the encirclement group and the corps advancing north of the lakes came so close with their inner flanks during the course of September 8 that the attack on the entire front of the army could be uniformly organized for September 9.\n3.

However, the Russian Guard Corps,\npreviously suspected near Warsaw, had to be assumed to be in front of the\nGerman Landwehr Corps in southern Poland according to a report. Thus,\nno disturbance was expected from the Narew for the time being.\nA threat to the German encircling wing from\nthe south and east, however, became increasingly apparent: reports of\nthe assembly of Russian troops at Schtschutschin and Grajewo were\navailable from aviators. There, it initially seemed to involve only weaker\nforces, individual brigades or regiments. While the parts of the 1st and\n3rd Finnish Rifle Brigade defeated at Bialla had retreated to the northeast,\naviators now observed new opponents from Lyk marching northwest\ntowards Neu-Jucha. At least the Russian XXII Corps from Finland\n(consisting of 4 rifle brigades of 8 battalions each) had to be assumed\nin the southeastern corner of East Prussia, but probably also other new\nRussian forces. In front of the encircling group's front, however, only\nthe Russian 43rd Infantry Division (from the II Corps) was detected\non September 8, now with both brigades.\nNorth of the lakes, the enemy remained calm in their fortified\nposition as before. The strong reserves at Insterburg (a corps) and along\nthe roads from there to the front were again detected by aviators on\nSeptember 8. Agents had observed the approach of two more reserve\ndivisions (54th and 55th) near Tilsit in recent days. Therefore, the\npossibility was still strongly considered that the enemy, perhaps after\nthe arrival of these reinforcements, might transition to an attack with\ntheir northern wing. The most effective countermeasure was the rapid\nexecution of the German attack on the southern wing. For this, the\narmy command wanted to utilize everything at hand. The defense\nagainst the threat from Schtschutschin and Lyk had to take a back seat\nand was to be left to the Landwehr Division Goltz.\nThus, for September 9, the 3rd Reserve Division, which was assumed\nnot at Drygallen but already at Klaussen, was set on Neu-Jucha, where\nit was to meet the enemy reported advancing from Lyk. The I Army\nCorps was to visibly continue the attack movement north of the Goldap\nGeg-Sea. General v. Fran\u00e7ois was now given command of the army\ncavalry (2/3 1st and 8th Cavalry Division).

On both sides of Lake Mauer, the attack of the XVII and XX Army Corps had to be coordinated and mutual artillery support across the lake ensured. The XVII Army Corps was to continue the attack northward against P\u00f6\u00dflitten and as soon as possible bring heavy artillery into position so that it could catch the opponent of the XX Army Corps at Angerburg in the rear, while the XX Army Corps was to flank the enemy positions west of P\u00f6\u00dflitten with two 10-cm cannon batteries assigned to it from the Gro\u00df-Steinkort peninsula during the night of September 9. This corps was also to continue the attack on September 9 with a strong right wing. Against the corner of Gerdauen, the XI Army Corps and I Reserve Corps were to open the artillery battle early on the 9th, but the infantry was to advance on the strong enemy position only after extensive artillery preparation. There was no rush with the attack here; it seemed sufficient to prevent the enemy from shifting reserves against the German encircling wing. The assault was therefore scheduled for the 3rd day of attack, early on September 11.\nFurther north, the Guard Reserve Corps (with the main reserve Posen) was now to participate in the attack at Allenburg, but also always be ready to repel an enemy advance on its left wing through strong echeloning to the left and strong terrain reinforcements. Subsequently, the fortress of K\u00f6nigsberg was to advance its forces sent south (about 5 battalions, 2 squadrons, 10 batteries) between the forest area of Frisching and the Pregel against Tapiau and subordinate them to the Guard Reserve Corps. The main forces of the fortress, however, remained behind the Deime in anticipation of a Russian attack. To reinforce the northern wing, the army command finally decided to also draw half of the 35th Reserve Division (20th Landwehr Brigade) from the East Prussian southern front.\nOn the southern front, September 9 brought a surprise: The Russian Narew Army advanced again. In total, at least two corps and several cavalry divisions were available to it. The airmen had so far identified two columns of brigade size marching from Prasnycz northward as well as a cavalry brigade, 3rd Division with infantry, advancing from the south on Myszyniec. Despite this new threat to its own rear, the German army command stuck to the transport of the 1/2 35th Reserve Division to the west.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>dieser neuen Bedrohung des eigenen R\u00fcckens hielt das deutsche Armee-Oberkommando an dem Abtransport der 1/2 35.

Thus, only three weak German Landwehr brigades remained against the Russian superiority on the southern front. \u2014 Also on the southern flank of East Prussia, stronger enemy forces were reported early on September 9th than previously: one brigade, according to another report 3 to 4, arrived from the south at Schtschutschin; 1 to 2 brigades were stationed at Grajewo and additional troops at Lyck. A unified Russian advance against the rear of the German encirclement became more and more apparent.\nMeanwhile, the 3rd Reserve Division (with the 1st Cavalry Brigade) under Lieutenant General v. Morgen had turned north early on September 9th, against the enemy who had marched from Lyck to Klaussen the previous afternoon. To attack him from the most effective direction, the division chose the route east of the Klaussen lakes. The Army High Command had intended to support them with the Landwehr Division Goltz advancing from Johannisburg via Arys. However, since Lieutenant General Freiherr v. der Goltz had already set his division marching east to Bialla, the High Command maintained this advance direction and instructed the general to retrace the march in stages so that the division could still turn north to Arys under strong enemy pressure from the south and cover the rear of the encirclement by opening the local narrows. The Landwehr Division reached Bialla that day, but the enemy in the south did not advance further. \u2014 Meanwhile, the attack of the 3rd Reserve Division, after removing Russian positions, came to a halt in the evening before Neuendorf and Thalussen. The enemy blocked the roads to Lyck here. With rifles in hand, friend and foe remained facing each other at a distance of about 100 meters. Lieutenant General v. Morgen intended to continue the attack at dawn on September 10th.\nGeneral of Infantry v. Fran\u00e7ois led his I Army Corps north on September 9th on both sides of the Widminner Lake and then pulled the two cavalry divisions out to the east. The enemy, the Russian 1st Cavalry Division and parts of three different regiments of the 43rd Infantry Division, offered no lasting resistance in the face of the German superiority. In the evening, the cavalry corps Brecht, with the 1st Cavalry Division, held the narrows of Neu-Jucha, with the 8th controlling the area east of the Gablitz Lake, while the I Army Corps had advanced deep into the flank of the enemy, who was positioned at Kruglanken opposite the XVII Army Corps.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>die Flanke des Gegners vorgedrungen war, der bei Kruglanken dem XVII.

Its attack front was spanned by the Russian positions in an arc. They had to be broken through. General v. Mackensen wanted to lead the decisive attack in a northerly direction to cooperate with the XX Army Corps, and in doing so, penetrate the enemy position west of the Goldapher Lake near Wiesental, where a weakness was believed to have been identified, and at P\u00f6tsf\u00dfen. The 35th Infantry Division assigned to Kruglanken was therefore instructed not to advance further east after taking the local Russian positions, but to let strong forces follow behind the 36th Infantry Division, which was leaning north. The attack was to break out early in the morning in an easterly as well as northerly direction after strong artillery preparation. However, the enemy showed unexpected ability and astonishing strength, even launching several counterattacks at Kruglanken. The troops of the German 35th Infantry Division under Lieutenant General Hennig had a difficult position here against concealed enemy batteries. In the afternoon, the arrival of the I Army Corps from the south gave them relief, and the enemy began to retreat eastward. It was only with the onset of darkness that the Russian positions at Kruglanken could be captured. \u2014 To the north, Lieutenant General v. Heineccius led his 36th Infantry Division into the attack. The 69th Infantry Brigade, assigned to Wiesental under Major General v. Engelbrechten, encountered stronger resistance there than expected. On the other hand, the commander of the 3rd West Prussian Infantry Regiment No. 129, Colonel Bre\u00dfler, believed he had identified a weakness in the enemy position east of P\u00f6tsf\u00dfen from the left flank of the brigade and therefore pressed his entire regiment against the eastern edge of this place on his own responsibility.

It had the order to attack the enemy east of the Rjesauser Lake with its strongest right wing. General of Artillery v. Scholtz had the 41st Infantry Division advance towards this enemy under enemy artillery fire, while holding back the 37th Infantry Division on the left to protect the flank against the northeast. The corps had the impression that although there were only a few, there were particularly well-hidden Russian batteries opposite. It was not possible to suppress their fire. Therefore, in the afternoon, when favorable news about the advance of the I and XVII Army Corps was received, the commanding general deemed it appropriate to continue fighting defensively. He also obtained the agreement of the army high command to this decision and halted the forward movement of his army corps. Thus, the previously intense artillery battle on this front gradually subsided, the infantry remained in the line Pristanien\u2014Rjesauser Lake, only the I Battalion of the 1st Posen Infantry Regiment No. 18 had already advanced beyond it. This battalion reached the road junction and the Fuchsberg north of Pristanien without significant combat. However, far ahead of the front and without artillery support, it soon suffered so much from enemy fire that it had to retreat in the evening.\nAt the XI Army Corps and the I Reserve Corps, early on the morning of September 9, reports of the evacuation of enemy positions, which had also surfaced the day before, prompted the sub-commanders to advance their infantry beyond the initially ordered line. However, this movement was soon halted from above, as the reports at the commanding general of the I Reserve Corps, General of Infantry v. Below, as well as at the army high command, were not believed. This cautioned for prudence. But the troops themselves had meanwhile gained the impression that the enemy was holding back, and so the forward movement was stopped. West of Nordenburg, the Russians even tried to create space through a strong advance. Parts of the 38th Infantry Division from the XI Army Corps under Major General v. Berjen repelled them. Otherwise, on this day in the area around Gerdauen, there was only artillery combat, which also here did not bring any German superiority and gradually subsided in the afternoon.\nThe Guard Reserve Corps also encountered strong artillery resistance. Its infantry worked its way north of the Alle, where the Guard Reserve Infantry Brigade under Major General Freiherr v.

Langermann and Erlencamp advanced, albeit with significant losses, up to the Russian positions. However, since the combat power of the opposing artillery remained completely unbroken and the Russian reserves at the Pregel continued to threaten the northern flank, the commanding General, General of Artillery v. Gallwitz, refrained from continuing the attack on this day.\nIn the evening, the overall impression at the Army High Command was that the attack of the I and XVII Army Corps east of the lakes was progressing well, while they faced a particularly strong artillery position at the front. So far, it had not been possible to suppress the Russian artillery fire anywhere. The German infantry faced a difficult task, which the High Command viewed with serious concern. On the other hand, the overall situation was becoming increasingly tense: The advance of the Narew Army against the East Prussian southern border and the pressure from the enemy from Schtschutschin and Lyck could still significantly disrupt the entire operation if victory was not achieved soon. The advance of the enemy from Lyck had already diverted the 3rd Reserve Division from the main decision. It seemed to face stronger Russian forces. How the battle with this division had progressed in the meantime was unknown to the Army High Command. On the other hand, strong reserves continued to be reported behind the Russian northern flank. A telegram from the K\u00f6nigsberg fortress on the morning of September 9th reported the following forces as a result of aerial reconnaissance: about one division halfway between Gerdauen and Insterburg on the railway, two corps at Insterburg, another corps 30 km northwest of Insterburg, then extensive deployments. Bivouacs west of this city along the Pregel and finally an infantry brigade marching over Nortitten to the front. Even if only half of these strengths were assumed to be correct, it still amounted to two corps. Additionally, there was a report that the enemy had advanced positions on the further Alle-Ufer in the evening at Wehlau. This again indicated Russian offensive intentions. \u2014 Since the Njemen Army, according to the division numbers known by September 9th, comprised at least 14 1/2 infantry and 5 1/2 cavalry divisions1), it was not considered likely that General v. Rennenkampf, with such a force, would readily concede the battle due to the German encirclement.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>scheinlich, da\u00df General v.

Rennenkampf, with such a force, would lose the battle due to the German encirclement without further ado. At the very least, he would deploy his strong reserves around Insterburg beforehand, if not for his own decisive attack over Wehlau, then at least for a counterattack to the south against the German encirclement.\nThese circumstances reinforced the Army High Command in its intention to only carry out the frontal attack against the enemy's fixed position and its immense artillery power once the encirclement had become fully effective. It seemed to be progressing well and was expected to bring the decision. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg insisted that the assault against the Russian front should only be carried out on September 11 and ordered only a continuation of the attack for the 10th. Meanwhile, the victorious XVII Army Corps was to advance closely along the lakes that day, with the right wing over Kutten, towards Buddern\u2014Angerburg, to open the Russian position west of Angerburg from the rear for the XX Army Corps. This corps, for its part, was to hold the Fuchsberg, the evacuation of which was still unknown to the Army High Command, under all circumstances. The attack movement of the XVII Army Corps was to be covered on the open flank by the advance of the I Army Corps. However, both corps were not to cross the Bentheim\u2014Klimken line (8 km north of Angerburg) for the time being, as a Russian counterattack from Insterburg was to be expected. The order for the cavalry corps Brecht, subordinated to General v. Fran\u00e7ois, remained unchanged: \"towards Goldap.\"\nThe morning of September 10 brought a complete change in the situation: When the infantry of the XI Army Corps and the I Reserve Corps advanced against the enemy in the early morning hours, they found the Russian positions on both sides of Gerdauen evacuated, the city in flames. The Army High Command received the following first report from the I Reserve Corps at 5:30 a.m.: \"36th Reserve Division is in the enemy's position on the Gerdauen\u2014Trausen road. According to prisoners, the position was evacuated 1\u00bd hours ago, and in considerable disarray.\" General v. Below had deployed his corps on both sides of the Insterburg railway for pursuit and informed the XI Army Corps.

At least the troops were spared the losses that a heavy frontal attack against the strong enemy position would have cost. However, the situation was not yet considered clear enough, even after the report from the 1st Reserve Corps, to decide to commit everything to a relentless pursuit. In view of the strong reserves of the enemy, it seemed as if the flanking maneuver set on Benheim was still in place. Thus, at 7 a.m., the Army High Command initially set only short-term goals for the frontal pursuit and urged the corps to be cautious: The XX Army Corps was to advance with the right wing north of Angerburg, with the left past the Nordwburger Lake \"step by step\" and by sending a detachment to Angerburg itself, open the narrow passage of Ognowen for the XVII Army Corps. The XI Army Corps was also to \"attack cautiously, not to run headlong into it.\" It was given the line Nordwburg\u2014Klonvfen (10 km east of Gerdauen) as a target. The 1st Reserve Corps was instructed to advance with the main forces north of the Insterburg railway, up to Klonvfen-Friedrichsdalwe (9 km north of Gerdauen), but not to go beyond this line initially. It was rather to \"dig in immediately in the gained position. Caution advised, as setbacks are to be expected from the area of Insterburg and west.\" Following the 1st Reserve Corps, the Guard Reserve Corps was to advance, but its left wing was to \"remain strongly held back in anticipation of the enemy attack.\" Before the Army High Command issued further orders, it wanted to await the results of the ongoing aerial reconnaissance.\nMeanwhile, serious concerns had arisen due to the situation of the 3rd Reserve Division west of Lye: At 6:18 a.m., General v. der Goltz, commander of the Landwehr Division, reported from Johannisburg: \"3rd Reserve Division has urgently requested assistance over Andreaswalde.\" Whether this will still be possible today is questionable due to the great distance and the reports about the enemy near Schtschutschin.

The General Command of the I Army Corps, to which Lieutenant General v. Morgen was subordinate, had not yet received any report on the outcome of his battle on September 9th. The 1st Cavalry Division, tasked with establishing contact with the 3rd Reserve Division, reported at 7 a.m. from the area 6 km north of Neujucha: \"Position and situation of the 3rd Reserve Division cannot be determined, despite radio inquiries to the 1st Cavalry Brigade and numerous liaison patrols and cars. 1st Cavalry Brigade back to Andreaswalde at night.\" The 1st Cavalry Division wanted to continue riding north at 9 a.m. into the rear of the Russian army. However, it was the only troop the Army High Command had at hand to bring the now urgently needed help to the 3rd Reserve Division. So it was decided to turn the 1st Cavalry Division from its successfully reached advance direction. At 9:15 a.m., it received the order to ride south immediately to help the 3rd Reserve Division, \"Urgency required.\" \u2014 1\u00bd hours after the departure of this order, the following message, sent at 8:30 a.m., from Lieutenant General v.

Morgen only wants to send cavalry after him, but continue the march with his division over Lyck to the north to engage in the decisive battle. This message relieved the Army High Command of concern for the 3rd Reserve Division as well as the threat from Lyck, but the 1st Cavalry Division was out of hand and could not be reached again by radio for the next few hours.\nMeanwhile, the Army High Command had been waiting with great tension for further news, especially on the results of aerial reconnaissance, since the report from the I Reserve Corps about the evacuation of the enemy position. They were sparse and initially brought no clarification: The K\u00f6nigsberg airship Z. 4 had detected wind of the same extent as before at night, particularly great appreciation. The aircraft assigned for morning reconnaissance by the Army High Command's aviation department had to return due to engine defects. No conclusions could be drawn from the enemy radio traffic; the Russians had been using almost exclusively ciphered radio messages for several days, also changing the call signs several times.

However, there was still about one corps there. 40 minutes after this report from K\u00f6nigsberg, the flyers of the XI Army Corps also reported the enemy's departure to the east.\nThere was no longer any doubt that General v. Rennenkampf was in full retreat. Thus, the battle was won. However, the major blow intended by the German leadership, which was supposed to bring about the downfall of the Russian army, did not succeed. Only vigorous pursuit could still harm the enemy and secure the freedom of movement that the German 8th Army urgently needed for an operation to support the Austrians and Hungarians.\n4. The Pursuit.\n(Map 14 and Sketch 10, p. 313.)\nThe pursuit had to focus primarily from the south against the Russian retreat routes. These ran via Goldap, Gumbinnen, and Lissit to the east. The main road and double-track railway from Insterburg via Gumbinnen to Kowno was the most important and efficient connection of the Russian Njemen Army. If it was blocked, the Russians would be pushed against the Njemen and over it to Schaulen. The goal for the next few days had to be to reach the Gumbinnen-Kowno road from the south. On September 10th at noon, this movement was initiated by individual orders: The Cavalry Corps Brecht, to which the 1st Cavalry Brigade previously assigned to the 3rd Reserve Division had to be directed, could not initially maintain an order to advance on Goldap. The 3rd Reserve Division was ordered to proceed to Marggrabowa. The I Army Corps was to turn instead of Bentheim, more to the east, against the line Goldap-Kleszowen, the XVII received the direction to Darteyhmen.\nHowever, these movements could only be initiated to a large extent on September 10th due to the already advanced time of day, but not yet carried out: Thus, the 3rd Reserve Division, although the enemy had already withdrawn in front of it on the night of September 10th, after the exertions and battles of the last few days, only reached 6 km north of Lyck, while the vanguard of the Landwehr Division Goltz approached this city from the south.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>gezogen war, nach den Anstrengungen und K\u00e4mpfen der letzten Tage nur noch bis 6 km n\u00f6rdlich Lyck, w\u00e4hrend sich die Anf\u00e4nge der Landwehr-Division Goltz dieser Stadt von S\u00fcden n\u00e4herten.</fragment_2>", "289": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Um\".

However, the bulk of the division, the 23rd (1st Royal Saxon) and the 40th (3rd Royal Saxon) Cavalry Brigade, under the division commander Major General Count v. d. Schulenburg, drove out the enemy holding south of the city of Goldap, took the city filled with Russian supplies, and captured 600 prisoners. Thus, the roads over Goldap to Suwalki and Wischtjyniez were blocked for the enemy.\nThe I Army Corps, whose advance towards Goldap was particularly important, had already exhausted its day's performance in a march purely northward when the new order arrived. Its 1st Infantry Division had reached the area of Benkheim and east by evening. The entire 2nd Infantry Division, however, had been deployed northeast against an enemy who, it seemed, was trying to resist the XVII Army Corps north of Rutten to Wischtjyniez. 500 prisoners from the Russian 72nd Infantry (Reserve) Division and 32 guns fell into the hands of the division of Lieutenant General v. Falk. In the evening, this division moved north of Kutten to rest. Overall, General v. Fran\u00e7ois reported a capture of 50-60 guns and several thousand prisoners on this day.\nThe XVII Army Corps had only set out after the heavy fighting of the previous day when the I Army Corps was at about the same level with it. It now pursued the retreating enemy northward alongside the 2nd Infantry Division and advanced by evening with the 35th Infantry Division at Bentheim, where the infantry shot down three Russian aircraft, far ahead of the front of this division of the I Corps. The 36th Infantry Division reached the area north of Buddern and thus connected with the XX Army Corps advancing north of the lakes.\nMeanwhile, since noon on September 10th, all forces north of the lakes had been deployed for further pursuit. In front of the XX Army Corps, the enemy had held out longer in the morning to cover its retreat than at Gerdauen. At 11 a.m., General v.

For the time being, 60-70 guns and several thousand prisoners had been brought in. \"The pursuit will continue very vigorously tomorrow, and we hope to significantly increase the spoils of victory.\" Accordingly, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg set far-reaching pursuit goals for September 11, to inflict as heavy losses as possible on the retreating enemy by deploying all forces. At 5 a.m., the corps were to set out and reach the line Filipow\u2014Gumbinnen\u2014area north of Insterburg during the day: The cavalry corps Brecht, now directly subordinated to the army high command, was deployed east of the Rominten Heath, in the direction of Mariampol\u2014Willowitschi, deep into the enemy's rear. The 3rd Reserve Division was to reach Filipow to protect the flank. In the center, Generaloberst v. Hindenburg wanted to lead five corps side by side against the 50 km wide line Mehlsakern (I. Army Corps)\u2014Tollmingkehmen (XVII. Army Corps)\u2014Walterkehmen (XX. Army Corps)\u2014Gumbinnen (XI. Army Corps)\u2014Dwarischken east of Insterburg (I. Reserve Corps). On the northern flank, the Guard Reserve Corps, to which the entire main reserve K\u00f6nigsberg was now subordinated, was to advance not south of the Usztrawischken Forest, but north of the Pregel.\nThese far-reaching pursuit orders of the army high command were only partially executed on September 11:\nFrom the cavalry corps Brecht, the 1st Cavalry Division, whose command Generalleutnant Brecht himself had retained, advanced 24 km forward without being significantly held up by the enemy and reached Filipow. The 8th Cavalry Division under Generalmajor Graf v. d. Schulenburg had already been attacked in Goldap at 2 a.m. by Russian troops, who advanced with great superiority from the northwest and north against the city. The Saxon Guard Cavalry Regiment repelled them at the Goldap River; its commander, Major Graf zur Lippe, died a hero's death. The cavalry managed to hold the important place until the Russians withdrew at 9 a.m. and the beginning of the German I. Army Corps (1st Infantry Division) entered the city from the south. After the night battle, the cavalry division could only resume its advance at noon. It reached Dubeningken in the evening, 12 km north of Filipow, only slightly held up by Russian rearguards. Thus, the cavalry corps was reunited, but for the time being still stood south, not east of the Rominten Heath.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>nicht \u00f6stlich der Rominterischen Heide.</fragment_2>", "292": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Da die rechte Flanke des XI.

By noon, the I Army Corps, marching in two columns, reached Goldap without a fight, where a march halt was made. From the XVII Army Corps, the western 36th Infantry Division encountered strong enemy forces north of the Stallup\u00f6nen Forest. General v. Mackensen attempted to at least advance his right, the 35th Infantry Division, eastwards in the direction of pursuit. However, as the enemy continued to extend in this direction south and southeast of Nossow and even went on the offensive, the 35th Infantry Division was gradually fully engaged against them. The XX Army Corps also soon encountered stronger resistance. In consideration of the overall situation, the commander of the right wing division (41st Infantry Division), Major General Sonntag, attempted to assist the XVII Army Corps at Szabienen with parts of his forces, thereby also clearing the way east for himself. Eventually, however, all forces of the XX Army Corps were drawn to the enemy tenaciously holding north of Dombrowen.\nThe XI Army Corps had already encountered resistance across its entire front when advancing, which was particularly strong in front of the northern 22nd Infantry Division of the corps. The General Command had received reports that the enemy was attacking here, and thus had the impression that it was no longer dealing with Russian rearguards, but with newly introduced forces. To relieve the 22nd Infantry Division, General v. Pl\u00fcskow had already at 6:30 a.m. ordered the right wing division of the I Reserve Corps advancing on Jodlauken to turn southeast from there. He reported to the Army High Command at 8:50 a.m. about the situation: \u201cXI Army Corps is engaged in combat at the Jume and Stallup\u00f6nen sector for four hours. I Reserve Corps is requested to engage in combat.

It is unlikely that more was said, so that the Army High Command took action. Since the right flank of the XI Army Corps was not defeated and significant parts of it had so far stood firm, a renewed standstill, perhaps even a counterattack in a southwesterly direction was still quite possible, especially in conjunction with an attack conducted behind this front to the south or southeast against the German encirclement.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>jetzt noch durchaus m\u00f6glich, zumal in Verbindung mit einem hinter dieser Front nach S\u00fcden oder S\u00fcdosten gegen die deutsche Umklammerung gef\u00fchrten Angriffe.</fragment_2>", "293": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Nach zweist\u00fcndiger Rast\".

This view prompted the army high command to decide to halt the overtaking pursuit and to turn with everything against the enemy assumed to be around Darkehmen. Thus, just 20 minutes after the telephone conversation with the XI Army Corps, new orders were issued to the corps: The I Army Corps was to turn towards Gawaiten (north of Goldap), the XVII towards Darkehmen, and the XX to engage in the battle of the XI Army Corps. But then, shortly thereafter, at 9:15 a.m., a radio message from the I Army Corps to the 1st Cavalry Brigade was overheard, stating that the enemy was retreating everywhere, and the 1st Cavalry Brigade was to occupy Stallup\u00f6nen today. This raised doubts again about abandoning the effective pursuit direction of the I Army Corps under all circumstances. Perhaps the battle directed northwards could be managed without the immediate involvement of this corps. Therefore, the order for the I Army Corps was amended: it was to be left to them to proceed from Goldap northeast to Tollmingkehmen or Gawaiten.\nWhen General v. Francois received the first order to turn towards Gawaiten at 1 p.m.\u00b9) during the rest in Goldap, he could not decide to follow it immediately. He waited and sent the 1st Infantry Division to continue towards Tollmingkehmen, while he, in view of the serious battle at the XVII Army Corps, deployed the 2nd Infantry Division towards Gawaiten. The 1st Division reached Tollmingkehmen with the foremost parts without a fight by midnight, while the 2nd encountered an enemy ready for defense south of Gawaiten. Their artillery opened fire against him in the evening. However, the division commander, Lieutenant General v. Falk, postponed the attack to the next morning due to the advanced hour of the day.\nAt the XVII Army Corps, all parts had already turned northward upon receiving the order to turn. The 35th Infantry Division advanced in the evening to Kleszowen, but the 36th faced such strong resistance from the enemy entrenched east and north of Szabienen until nightfall that both parts remained lying opposite each other with rifles in hand. General v. Mackensen planned to continue the attack here the following day.\nMeanwhile, after a two-hour rest, the XX Army Corps followed and reached the western bank of the Angerapp south of Darkehmen and at this town in the evening.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) v.

It was thus positioned behind the enemy, against whom the XVII Army Corps fought up to Nuntelwerden. General v. Scholtz urged the southern 41st Infantry Division to cross the river that evening. However, due to the depth of the water and the Russian occupation on the east bank, this was no longer possible.\nEven before the XI Army Corps, the enemy gradually gave up resistance throughout the morning. A Russian attack seems not to have taken place here at all. How the mutual understanding, particularly emphasized in the evening report of the XI Army Corps, came about could not be clarified. While the southern 38th Infantry Division of the corps under Lieutenant General Wagner slowly advanced west of Trempen against constant enemy resistance, the commanding general was able to lead the 22nd Infantry Division under Major General Dieffenbach further towards the Angerapp in the afternoon without significant delay. The division continued the pursuit tirelessly until midnight and reached up to 2 km west of the Angerapp crossing at Nemmersdorf, while the 8th Infantry Division, without connection to the general command, had gone to rest west of Trempen at 5 p.m. and thus remained over 15 km behind the front of the neighboring divisions.\nIn front of the I Reserve Corps, the enemy \u2014 unlike before the southern corps \u2014 offered virtually no resistance. After the first German cannon shots, their rear guards vacated the field. The penetration to support the XI Army Corps was also unnecessary. Thus, General v. Below could continue the pursuit towards Insterburg, his last peacetime location, almost without interruption. There, the Russian army leader was supposed to have set up his headquarters, and Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich was also expected to be present. The hope of capturing him spurred the steps of the reserve and militia men. By evening, the 1st Reserve Division reached the Angerapp near Judtschen, the 36th Reserve Division immediately behind the withdrawing Russians at Insterburg. Their vanguard advanced another 10 km beyond the city, while the active infantry regiment 54 belonging to the division broke through the Russian rear guards at Angerapp and Inster on the extreme left flank and captured 300 prisoners.\nThe Guard Reserve Corps was delayed for a long time by the bridge crossing over the Pregel, as its entire bridging equipment had previously been installed at Omet and Alle.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>den Pregel lange aufgehalten, da sein gesamtes Br\u00fcckenger\u00e4t bisher noch an Omet und Alle eingebaut gewesen war.</fragment_2>", "295": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \n\"Wenn der Feind dann wider Erwarten noch stand, mu\u00dfte ihn das I.

Further north, the main reserve Posen followed in echelon to the left rear, and the main reserve K\u00f6nigsberg had advanced over Labiau.\nAt the army headquarters, there was soon no doubt after the \nalarming report of the XI Army Corps that the enemy was only fighting for retreat. However, it was not \npossible to immediately reverse the ordered turning of the I and XVII Army Corps \nto the north. The commanding generals of both corps knew anyway that the pursuit \nin a northeasterly direction should be resumed as soon as the situation allowed. Since the XVII Army Corps was already pinned by the enemy on its \nflank, the army commander ultimately diverted only a single \nGerman division, the 2nd Infantry Division from the I Army Corps, significantly \nfrom its direction. The 1st was, instead of heading for Mehlsheim, marching 10 km \neast to Tollmingkehmen, the original target of the XVII Army Corps. As far as the overtaking pursuit on this day \nsuffered a delay and loss of strength, this was less due to \nthe German units than to those of the enemy, who \nhad advanced with strong forces over Narethemen to the south to \navert the impending danger.\nOn the evening of September 11, the German I, XVII, XX, \nand XI Army Corps stood from Tollmingkehmen over Gawaiten\u2014Szabienen\u2014 \nDarethemen to Nemmersdorf around the enemy mass concentrated south and east of Darethemen.

However, since this knowledge of the situation was lacking due to the difficulty of \ncommunication, the continuation of the pursuit the next day, but then in a northeasterly direction, was the given course. If the enemy \nstill stood unexpectedly, the I Army Corps had to overtake him. At the same time, sharp pressure on the front was all the more \nnecessary, as the pursuit could not be continued far.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "296": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Dem I.

The 3rd Reserve Division was to occupy Suwalki, \"a further advance of the division to the east is not intended.\" The five corps positioned at the front were to continue pursuing in a total width of 40 km, with the center (XX Army Corps) on Stallup\u00f6nen, while on the left flank the Guard Reserve Corps received the direction towards Lissit.\nEven on September 12, it was not possible, especially for the right wing, to achieve the goals set by the army command:\nFrom the cavalry corps, Lieutenant General Brecht led his 1st Cavalry Division (without the 1st Brigade), advancing only to Wischnay, east of the Rominten Heath, without encountering the enemy. The 8th Cavalry Division experienced multiple delays while crossing the heath due to the enemy and finally encountered renewed resistance northeast of Wischnyniez, which it could no longer break. Thus, on the evening of September 12, the cavalry corps was still a full day's march away from the main road near Wilkowischki. However, it had already exerted an effect. The Russians reported that the 8th Cavalry Division, \"despite the immediate proximity of three Russian cavalry divisions, broke out of the Rominten Heath\"; \"as if startled, it pressed against our columns, which were retreating in chaotic disorder, and spread panic\"2).\nThe 3rd Reserve Division took Suwalki after a brief skirmish.

General v. Fran\u00e7ois, who had only radio contact with the army headquarters, viewed the situation differently than the high command. He reported that his corps was not in a position to carry out the received order, as it could no longer advance on the poor roads. However, during the course of September 11, the general also gained the impression that it was necessary to first deal with the enemy, who was in front of his 2nd Infantry Division and the XVII Army Corps. He therefore wanted to deploy only the 1st Infantry Division against the Russian retreat route, and further west than ordered, to target Stallup\u00f6nen, while the 2nd Infantry Division was initially to throw the enemy at Gawaiten. The army high command could not agree with these intentions. They were incompatible with its understanding of the situation and the orders given to the other corps. Generaloberst v. Hindenburg insisted on carrying out the army order. Thus, on September 12, the I Army Corps set out in the assigned direction to the northeast, albeit significantly later than ordered, with the 2nd Infantry Division only at 9 a.m., after it had already initiated the attack against the enemy at Gawaiten. Meanwhile, the Russians pushed into the gap that had formed between the 1st and 2nd Infantry Divisions, occupied Tollmingkehmen, and held it until the evening. Some of them broke through to the east here, while others simultaneously escaped north of Pillup\u00f6nen, still under fire from the artillery of the 1st Division, across the border. In the evening, only half of the 1st Infantry Division of the I Army Corps was at Pillup\u00f6nen, while the other half of the division was still facing Tollmingkehmen with the opposite front.

Everything had to be attempted to incapacitate the Rennenkampf army for as long as possible, and to continue the pursuit on September 13 under extreme exertion of forces. At the same time, the future organization of the Eastern forces had to be considered, on the one hand to support the Austrians and Hungarians, and on the other to protect East Prussia, and therefore everything that was somehow dispensable at the front had to be withdrawn. Thus, the cavalry corps was again directed towards Mariampol\u2014Schipt, and was to halt the pursuit only at the Njemen River. The I Army Corps was to advance on Suwalki and Willkowischti and remain in this area later. The XVII and XX Army Corps were to continue the pursuit only with advance guards, the XI from Stallup\u00f6nen to Schirwindt, the I Reserve Corps to Schaki.\nBut even on September 13, the cavalry corps did not advance as desired: enemy, rain, and softened clay soil delayed movements. 12 km south of Willkowischti, both divisions finally stopped in the evening before new Russian resistance. \u2014 To the left of the cavalry, the I Army Corps reached the area south of Wirballen. Its northern, 1st Infantry Division was able to bring the Russians withdrawing here on the main road in two and three marching columns under effective fire, while the beginnings of the XI Army Corps pressed them from Stallup\u00f6nen. There, 2000 prisoners were taken in house-to-house fighting. In the evening, the foremost troops of the XI Army Corps stood before Wirballen and north. The I Reserve Corps had reached the area northeast of Pillkallen without a fight. For the XVII and XX Army Corps, there was no more room in the front line.\nEven on September 14, the pursuit continued for a short distance. The cavalry corps, now led by the Bavarian higher cavalry commander No. 3, General of Cavalry Ritter von Frommel, who had arrived from the western theater of war, reached the main road between Mariampol and Willkowischti in the fight against Russian rearguards. The 8th Cavalry Division captured 400 prisoners and seized 4 guns. The I Army Corps fought its way to Willkowischti and east, the XI to Schirwindt, the I Reserve Corps to Schaki and south of Jurburg. An attempt to intercept some Russian detachments left behind at Njemen was unsuccessful.

The Events Behind the Army<sup>1)</sup>.\n(Map 14.)\nWhile the bulk of the German 8th Army was pursuing eastward, further battles had also taken place at the southern border of East Prussia and near \u0141yk:\nOn September 9, half of the 35th Reserve Division was transferred to K\u00f6nigsberg. Thus, along the entire southern border, apart from individual Landsturm units, which could not be considered for serious combat, there were only 18 battalions, 6 squadrons, and 8 batteries: The main reserve Graudenz, which had extended eastward to Neidenburg, and the 5th Landwehr Brigade (from the 35th Reserve Division) were subordinated to the Governor of the Graudenz Fortress, Lieutenant General v. Zastrow. The 5th Landwehr Brigade moved northward from M\u0142awa to Janowo to confront the enemy reported from Przasnysz. Further east, the Deputy Commanding General of the XX Army Corps, General of Cavalry Count v. Schlieffen, fortified. Under him, the 70th Landwehr Brigade secured Myszyniec.\nThe enemy reached only as far as Myszyniec on September 9, within range of the German troops. It seemed to be a cavalry division, but at least 4 infantry battalions and 4 batteries were reported. Major General Breithaupt, who had only a little more than 3 battalions and 2 batteries of his 70th Landwehr Brigade at his disposal on site, evaded the Russian encirclement set against him after the first artillery shots and then marched back 33 km to Ortelsburg throughout the night.\nThe news of the retreat of the Breithaupt Brigade reached the Army High Command early on September 10. At that time, there was simultaneous concern for the 3rd Reserve Division, and it was not yet known that the army was retreating in a race. A further unfavorable development of the situation on the southern front, despite the low combat value of the Russian Narew Army, posed serious dangers. Therefore, there was great displeasure over the retreat of the 70th Landwehr Brigade. Colonel General v. Hindenburg arranged for it to be brought back to the border. But soon after, when there was no longer any doubt about the withdrawal of the Njemen Army, they could dispense with half of the 35th Reserve Division at K\u00f6nigsberg.\n</body>\n<footer>1) Connection to p. 285.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>njemen-Armee kein Zweifel mehr war, konnte man auf die halbe 35.

It was immediately sent back to the southern front at Soldau.\nMeanwhile, the situation had already cleared up there: The enemy did advance to the border on September 10, but only crossed it at Myschliniez, and even there only with small cavalry detachments. Otherwise, they remained in place and entrenched. However, the German Army High Command ordered, despite the weakness of their own troops, on September 12, the Governor of Graudenz and the Deputy Commanding General of the XX Army Corps to attack the enemy located north of the Narew, to deliver a decisive blow. \u2014 To this end, General v. Saffron and General Count Schlieffen had their weak Landwehr troops advance to attack across the border from the Soldau\u2014Willenberg line on September 14. The enemy offered resistance, especially at Chorzele, but retreated across the entire front on September 15. The German troops reached Biechanow and Prasnyisch by September 18. This success boosted the morale of the four German Landwehr brigades deployed here; they believed they had achieved it solely through their attack. They could not know that the Russians were retreating on higher orders.\nSimultaneously with the Russian operation against the southern Prussian southern front, the advancing parts of the III Russian Corps from the south and other Russian troops from the east made progress against Lyck. Here, Lieutenant General Baron v. der Goltz with his Landwehr Division withstood the Russian attack from three sides on September 12. On the 13th, supported by parts of the L\u00f6tzen garrison, he relieved pressure on the enemy's west flank with a thrust. On the same day, the enemy abandoned the attack here as well and retreated across the border. These were the last Russians who had stood on German soil. An advance by the 3rd Reserve Division from Suwalki prompted them to leave Augustow to the German pursuers on September 16.\n</body>\n<header>6.

This meant an immediate abandonment of the area around Warsaw. At the aforementioned meeting in Bjelostok) the Grand Duke rejected this. To protect the decisive operation in Galicia against an impact from East Prussia, sufficient forces had to be kept ready for defense at Warsaw and on the Narew. The advancing 10th Army (XXII Corps from Finland, III Siberian, I Turkestan and II Caucasian) was to be inserted into the gap between the 1st and 2nd Armies. On the other hand, a special Warsaw detachment (2 infantry and 1 3/4 cavalry divisions from the 2nd and 9th Armies) was formed on the western flank of the 2nd Army. Initially, they wanted to limit themselves to pure defense. Around mid-September, however, General Shilinski hoped, the 2nd Army would be operational again and the XXII and the III Siberian Corps would be ready. Then he wanted to resume the attack along the entire line. The Supreme Army Command had doubts whether the Germans would remain calm for so long.\nFor the defense, the Warsaw detachment, the 2nd and 10th Armies had the course of the Vistula with the fortresses of Warsaw and Nowogeorgiewsk and then the fortified Narew-Bobr line clearly outlined.\nRegarding how the Russian 1st Army should behave against the expected German attack, there had been an exchange of ideas between the army group and the army high command on August 31). General Mileant, the chief of staff of the 1st Army, had suggested retreating to the line Insterburg-Goldap to threaten the Germans from the north if they advanced through the lake area. The chief of staff of the army group, General Oranowski, had agreed with this plan. General v. Rennenkampf, however, had rejected it. He feared further retreats would have an unfavorable moral effect.

Thus, the 1st Army remained in its naturally strong position behind Deime, Alle, Omule, and leaning against the Masurian Lakes. With all means of field fortification available in the country, the position was reinforced. It was to be held \"as far as possible,\" as the army group command ordered on September 5 in view of the German advance. However, they did not expect a breakthrough by the Germans over L\u00f6tzen, nor the bold venture of outflanking around the southern shore of the lakes.\nAt the beginning of September, General v. Rennenkampf had a total of 16\u00bd infantry divisions, of which 8\u00bd were active, the rest reserve divisions, and 5\u00bd cavalry divisions under his command. This strength did not increase until the decisive days of battle. However, they did not dare to bring all field troops from the fortresses, although \"Reichswehr\" troops should have been available by then. Therefore, only parts, mainly artillery, from the 68th Reserve Division from Riga, the 73rd from Kowno, and the 76th from Grodno were brought to the front. The army group prohibited the deployment of heavy fortress artillery from Kowno on September 4; such artillery was not brought from other fortresses either, as far as we know.\nThus, at the beginning of the battles at the front, General v. Rennenkampf had only 14 infantry divisions, of which he deployed 8\u00bd north of the lakes in the front, starting from the right: the newly formed XXVI (Reserve) Corps with the 53rd and 56th Reserve Divisions, the 1st independent cavalry brigade and artillery of the 73rd Reserve Division at the Deime front, \u2014 the III Corps with the 25th and 27th Infantry Divisions at Allenburg, \u2014 the IV Corps with the 40th and 50th Infantry Divisions, the 5th Rifle Brigade and the 57th Reserve Division at Gerdauen, \u2014 the II Corps with the 26th Infantry Division at Angerburg.

The XXII Corps was to advance a vanguard \nagainst Johannisburg, while the III Siberian had to initially detach its \nforemost division, the 8th Siberian Rifle Division, to occupy the Narew \npositions Ossowjez and Lomsha.\nOn September 7, the Northwest Front army group received the first \nsurprising news that a German infantry division and a cavalry brigade \nwere advancing eastward along the East Prussian southern border.

A serious threat on the southern flank became apparent. The 10th Army had not yet provided the hoped-for relief. The Germans shifted north over Arzys and L\u00f6beln. The weak southern flank of the 1st Army found itself pressured by superior forces. The Russian front north of the lakes had not yet been seriously attacked, and the reserves as well as the numerous cavalry remained untouched. Thus, General v. Rennenkampf believed he could hold out even without the help of the 10th Army.\nOn September 8, he ordered that from the right wing, the 29th Infantry Division of the XX Corps and the 54th Reserve Division should move south to defend against the impending encirclement at Darkehmen and the 72nd Reserve Division stationed there. On September 9, he had the rest of the XX Corps (28th Infantry Division) follow and positioned the Cavalry Corps of the Chans and the 2nd Guard Cavalry Division at Goldap. These measures came too late to prevent the collapse of the 43rd Infantry Division at Pr\u00f6ssisch Eylau on the evening of September 9. However, for September 10, 4 infantry and 3 cavalry divisions were newly available for deployment at a location where previously only 1\u00bc infantry and 1 cavalry division had faced the German superiority. The situation was still by no means hopeless. But General v. Rennenkampf was unwilling to continue the fight. On the afternoon of September 9, he issued the order to retreat for the front north of the lakes. This order came as a surprise to the troops at the front. Nevertheless, the movement was undertaken in good order during the night of September 10. The northern wing, which had received the order as early as 5 p.m., and the center soon marched off, while the southern wing had to hold along Nordenburg and Angerburg. Here, the commanding general of the Russian IV Corps, General Aliew, created space through vigorous counterattacks on his own initiative.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) See p. 304.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "307": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Mit den Leistungen des Generalleutnants Khan Hussein mu\u00df man aber nicht zufrieden gewesen sein, denn er w\u00fcrde seines\".

Rennenkampf assumed the XXII Corps at this time in the advance against the rear of the German encirclement. He even considered advancing again with this corps on the southern flank. The consternation was all the greater at the headquarters of the 1st Army in Insterburg, as well as at the army group in Bjelostok, when on the night of September 11, the capture of Goldap by the Germans was reported. The experiences of Tannenberg were alarming. The withdrawal of the recently reinforced southern flank of the army was extremely endangered. Over Darkehmen, 2\u00bd divisions of the IV Corps had to retreat on September 11. South of them were still the II and XX Corps with a total of 6 divisions. The II was to make room to the south through counterattacks, the XX to retake Goldap. This did not succeed, but the defensive measures halted the overtaking pursuit of the Germans. In the evening, they reached as far as Gawaiten and Tollmingkehmen. The route to the east was blocked for the Russian masses still standing in and south of the Darkehmen\u2014Tollmingkehmen line. Any hope for help from the XXII Corps had vanished. Thus, the six divisions of the Russian southern flank escaped the impending capture by marching north-east at night. Parts of the XX Corps also seem to have escaped through Tollmingkehmen between the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the German I Army Corps on September 12.\nThe Russian army cavalry, numbering a total of four divisions on the southern flank, did not support the army's retreat as expected. The 1st Cavalry Division fought at Lake Widminner on September 9, but then General Gurko, following an earlier order, moved south to the 10th Army. The 2nd Guards Cavalry Division under Lieutenant General Rauch engaged the German XVII Army Corps north of Possessern early on September 10, and by the evening of the same day, its forward parts were driven out of Goldap by the German 8th Cavalry Division. Meanwhile, the Khan's cavalry corps, without fighting, reached the area south of the Rominten Heath. Only from September 11 did the three remaining cavalry divisions effectively take over the protection of the army flank in the Rominten Heath and halt the advance of the German cavalry corps. However, one must not have been satisfied with the performance of Lieutenant General Khan Hussein, as he was relieved of his command.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>mandos enthoben.</fragment_2>", "308": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Diese aber ging darauf nicht\".

Nevertheless, it was possible, under the protection of the army cavalry, to lead the mass of Russian troops in numerous, closely marching columns to Wirballen and north of the border.\nHeavily shaken and severely weakened in their combat strength, the 1st Army finally escaped with the bulk of its forces, albeit with considerable loss of guns and other equipment. However, it needed so much rest for reorganization that it retreated behind the Njemen without being pressured.\nDuring these events, the army group command had changed its intentions twice1). The attack order for the 10th and 2nd Army was revoked on September 9, when the 10th Army reported it was not yet in a position to attack. Since the 1st Army was also retreating, the 10th was now to retreat to Augustowo and Grajewo, while the 2nd Army was to remain standing. When General v. Rennenkampf temporarily considered attacking again with the southern flank, the order to attack was given again to the 10th and 2nd Army on the night of September 11, but by the 12th it was finally converted back into a retreat order, as the 1st Army was no longer expected to attack. These rapidly following counter-orders led to nothing unified happening. The XXII Corps withdrew the southern 3rd Reserve Division on the night of September 10, then the III Siberian Corps advanced against Lyck, but retreated again on the 13th; the 2nd Army remained inactive at the border for two days. The German pursuit was only disturbed insofar as the 1st Cavalry Division was temporarily withdrawn from the decisive pursuit direction. If the Russian army group of the Northwest Front had ruthlessly deployed all its subordinate forces to cooperate with General v. Rennenkampf, it could have posed far greater difficulties for the German pursuit.\nRegarding the blame for the new defeat, there were sharp disagreements among the higher Russian command authorities: General v. Rennenkampf relieved his chief of staff, General Mileant, of his position on September 11. This general was then ordered to the headquarters of the army group, which then requested the dismissal of General v. Rennenkampf from the Supreme Army Command on September 12. However, this did not happen, but instead, the commander of the army group, General Ghinski, was finally relieved of his position and replaced by General Russki, the previous victorious leader of the 3rd Army.</body>\n<footer>1) Sichowitsch, pp. 112, 113, 115, and 119.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>ein, sondern enthob schlie\u00dflich den Oberbefehlshaber der Heeresgruppe, General Ghinski, selbst seiner Stellung und ersetzte ihn durch General Russki, den bisherigen siegreichen F\u00fchrer der 3.

Reflections on the Battle.\nThe enormous numbers of prisoners and booty from the Battle of Tannenberg have led to the subsequent victory over the Russian Njemen Army often not receiving the attention it deserves, both for the audacity of the battle plan and the magnitude of the success.\nAs at Tannenberg, the speed and strength of the German movements shattered the Russian operational plan at the Masurian Lakes. Just as then, victory was achieved against superior forces, against superior forces on the East Prussian theater of war as a whole, as well as on the battlefield itself.\nOn both the German and Russian sides, part of the troops were weakened by previous losses. Therefore, the respective troop strengths cannot be compared; only the number of available units and guns can be set against each other.\nThe Russians had at their disposal up to the decisive days of fighting in East Prussia and along the East Prussian border at least 389 battalions, 288 squadrons, 1492 guns, while the Germans, including replacement and reserve troops, had only 232 battalions, 124 squadrons, 1212 guns.\nAgain, everything that could be reached was brought up on the German side for the battle itself. On the long and extremely threatened southern flank, against the Russian Narew Army, which itself counted only about 83 battalions, 97 squadrons, and 372 guns without fortress garrisons, only 24 reserve and replacement battalions, 10 squadrons, 78 guns remained. In the days when the decision was made, these numbers on the German side even decreased by a quarter. To defend against the Russian 10th Army, which by September 10th had grown to a strength of 72 battalions, 38 squadrons, and 252 guns, no more than 24 reserve and Landwehr battalions, 15 squadrons, and 60 guns were deployed in total.</body>\n<footer>1) Suchomlinow, p. 62.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>10.

Only in this way was it possible for the German command to attack the Njemen Army itself with somewhat adequate forces.\nIt was different on the Russian side: Of the divisions of the field army, a total of about 83 battalions, 18 squadrons, 176 guns remained in fortresses far behind the front. Without unity and without strength, parts of the 10th and 2nd Army were deployed to bring relief to the 1st.\nGeneral v. Rennenkampf had 228 battalions, 173 squadrons, 924 guns at his disposal for the battle. He was therefore much better equipped with artillery than General Samsonow at Tannenberg. His army was in a naturally strong position, which it could have expanded undisturbed for 8 days. \u2014 Generaloberst v. Hindenburg could lead 184 battalions, 99 squadrons, 1074 guns to attack this position, thus only superior in artillery. Experience for the attack against a position like the one faced here, especially regarding the need for guns and ammunition, was lacking. A determined advance seemed a risky venture under the circumstances. Step by step, always prepared to repel an advance by the superior defender, the troops were led against the position. Before the infantry assault, artillery superiority had to be achieved, but this was extremely difficult given the numerical ratio and was nowhere successful in view of the skillful Russian artillery use, and at that time still without aerial observation. Nevertheless, victory was achieved.\nThis victory is primarily due to the German leadership. After the victory at Tannenberg, they could count on the superiority of the German troops as a reliable factor. Thus, they decided on the bold, unexpected maneuver for the Russians east of the lakes. Radio messages indicating the strength and movements of the enemy did not help in these days. The Russians had become cautious. Their numerical superiority was estimated to be even greater than it actually was. And yet the German leader carried out the wide-ranging encirclement despite all dangers to success, managing to keep the enemy reserves away from the decision on the southern flank until the breakthrough there was successful.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "311": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die Russen\u00b9) geben\".

Rennenkampf had held his ground. After all, 1 1/4 Russian infantry divisions and 1 cavalry division had caused considerable difficulties for the German I and XVII Army Corps for days. However, reserves were completely lacking on the German side. The Russian leadership could not overlook all this. It would have required an outstanding personality to fight the battle to the last against the victors of Tannenberg, even though the Germans directly threatened the retreat routes.\nThe outcome of the battle did not quite meet the hopes placed on the encirclement. This could not be otherwise if the opponent retreated prematurely. The German leader had no means at his disposal to force him to fight through the battle. Even earlier and sharper attacks at the front could not have prevented the Russians from breaking off the fight by night march as soon as they wanted. It is assumed that such attacks would have at least partially tied up the Russian reserves in the north permanently and thereby increased the prospects of the overtaking pursuit. The hesitation with the frontal attack was not due to a misunderstanding of this effect, but to the weakness of the German attack front and its combat means. Russian countermeasures and a series of unfortunate incidents further impaired the outcome of the pursuit, such as on September 10 the dispatch of the 1st Cavalry Division to the south and the turning of the entire 2nd Infantry Division to the west, then on September 11 the alarming news from the XI Army Corps, for the 12th the differing view of the I Army Corps \u2014 and finally the weakness and overexertion of the German army cavalry, in which the 1st Cavalry Brigade also failed in the decisive days.

The XVII Army Corps bore the brunt with about 1,500 men; the XI Army Corps also suffered significant losses in the pursuit battles.\nThe magnitude of the previous successes in East Prussia is most clearly shown by the mutual loss figures. A loss of about 37,000 men for the German 8th Army is opposed by a total Russian loss of about 250,000 men (over 1/3 of the fighting troops), of which about 145,000 were prisoners; over 500 guns (more than 1/4 of the stock) were taken from them. The Russian army group of the Northwest Front had been decisively defeated in all its parts since the Battle of the Masurian Lakes: The 1st Army was no longer combat-ready for the next few weeks, the assembly of the 10th Army was thrown into confusion, the remnants of the 2nd had suffered another blow. All armies of this front had experienced the superior leadership and combat capability of German troops from their own experience. Confidence and assurance of victory were severely shaken.

The situation of the province \nmeant that it was more exposed to enemy incursions than other parts of the country.\nEven the peacetime expansion of the country's fortifications in the east showed \nthat the responsible authorities of the Reich anticipated the possibility of a \nRussian advance up to the Vistula. The line of this river had been increasingly \nstrengthened, especially in the years leading up to the war; the facilities in East \nPrussia itself had to take a back seat. This was particularly discussed in 1913 \nwhen the use of the \"defense contribution\" funds was addressed and had led to \nconcern in East Prussia at that time. General von Heeringen, as Minister of War, \nhad tried to counteract this with a decree of July 1, 1913. After that, \"no thought \nwas given to abandoning German territory either in East Prussia or any other \npart of the fatherland.\" The Minister of War spoke not only for reasons of \nsecrecy. The intentions he announced corresponded entirely to the instructions \nlaid down by the General Staff for the forces in the east. Whether such intentions \ncould be implemented in a war against two fronts in every case, that remained \nto be seen.\nWhat should happen if the enemy nevertheless invaded the country was \nessentially only discussed from purely military perspectives before the war. \nA repatriation of economic assets, insofar as it did not concern military, \nimmediately necessary for warfare, or state property, was not considered. \nThe question of whether and how it would be possible to secure the extensive \nand, in the event of a long war, also vital surplus stocks of the country's \nlivestock and harvests, therefore, did not come up for discussion. Such \nimportant peacetime measures belonged to the area of general war preparations, \non which, however, due to the stance of our policy and the difficulties of a collaboration among the involved independent higher Reich authorities, did not progress beyond preliminary discussions by the time of the war.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>sammenarbeitens der beteiligten selbst\u00e4ndigen h\u00f6heren Reichsbeh\u00f6rden bis zum Kriege \u00fcber Vorberatungen nicht hinausgekommen war.</fragment_2>", "314": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Ferner sollten die Regierung, sowie die Eisenbahn-, Post- und Vollverwaltung dem etwaigen Vordringen des Feindes entsprechend\"\n<fragment_1>Ferner sollten die Regierung, sowie die Eisenbahn-, Post- und Vollverwaltung dem etwaigen Vordringen des Feindes entsprechend</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"zur\u00fcckgezogen, die staatlichen Kassen und alle wichtigen Akten geborgen werden.\"\n<fragment_2>zur\u00fcckgezogen, die staatlichen Kassen und alle wichtigen Akten geborgen werden.</fragment_2>\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` ends without proper punctuation, suggesting it is incomplete.\n- `fragment_2` begins with \"zur\u00fcckgezogen,\" which logically continues the action described in `fragment_1`.\n- Combining them forms a coherent sentence: \"Ferner sollten die Regierung, sowie die Eisenbahn-, Post- und Vollverwaltung dem etwaigen Vordringen des Feindes entsprechend zur\u00fcckgezogen, die staatlichen Kassen und alle wichtigen Akten geborgen werden.\"\n<decision>The fragments align and form a coherent sentence.</decision>\n</thinking>\n\n<english_page_1_new>Furthermore, the government, as well as the railway, postal, and full administration, were to be withdrawn in accordance with the possible advance of the enemy, and the state treasuries and all important documents were to be secured.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>zur\u00fcckgezogen, die staatlichen Kassen und alle wichtigen Akten geborgen werden.</fragment_2>", "315": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"So hatte schon seit den ersten Augusttagen eine Flucht der Bev\u00f6lkerung, vor allem aus den zun\u00e4chst betroffenen \u00f6stlichen Grenzstrichen begonnen.\"\n\n<fragment_1>So hatte schon seit den ersten Augusttagen eine Flucht der Bev\u00f6lkerung, vor allem aus den zun\u00e4chst betroffenen \u00f6stlichen Grenzstrichen begonnen.</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"Diese Fluchtbewegung nahm sehr bald einen immer gr\u00f6\u00dferen Umfang an.\"\n\n<fragment_2>Diese Fluchtbewegung nahm sehr bald einen immer gr\u00f6\u00dferen Umfang an.</fragment_2>\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` ends with a period, indicating it is a complete sentence.\n- `fragment_2` begins a new thought and does not grammatically or logically continue `fragment_1`.\n- The fragments are independent and do not logically or grammatically connect into a single sentence.\n\n<decision>The fragments do not align and do not form a single coherent sentence.</decision>\n</thinking>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>320</pageno>\n<header>The Sufferings of East Prussia.</header>\n<body>withdrawn, the state coffers and all important documents secured. However, the district administrators and local leaders had to remain at their posts even in the event of an enemy incursion and ensure that the burdens of war were alleviated for the residents as much as possible.\nThe outbreak of war coincided with the harvest season. Thus, the mobilization, which required the immediate conscription of the militia for all threatened border areas, deprived agriculture of the bulk of its most capable workers just at the moment when they were most urgently needed. In the province of East Prussia, this loss is estimated at 130,000 harvest workers. However, it was still valuable that at least the present farm workers from Russia felt no urge to leave. Help was brought in from everywhere. In addition to women and children, about 10,000 urban workers and students from higher schools actively participated. Thus, it was possible, favored by the weather, to bring in the grain harvest largely successfully. However, threshing could initially only be done to a barely significant extent.\nThe Chamber of Agriculture had already issued a call to dispose of surplus livestock at the end of July\u00b9), and in the first days after the outbreak of war, the desire arose from the population to bring valuable horse and livestock, especially breeding animals, to safety in the interior of the Reich. It was not until August 15 that it was possible to free up individual train cars for this purpose. Meanwhile, the start of military operations had already made itself felt significantly.\nThe overwhelming Russian cavalry masses had indeed missed the time when they could have significantly disrupted mobilization or harvest; their operations had been limited to the outermost border areas. But the appearance of the first Russian troops on German soil was enough to create the impression among the population and authorities that something terrible was to be expected from this enemy. Peaceful citizens were shot, district administrators, local leaders, and other respected persons were arrested, mistreated, and in some cases taken away as hostages, buildings were set on fire. Thus, since the early days of August, a flight of the population, especially from the initially affected eastern border areas, had begun.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) East Prussian War Journals 3, p. 57.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "316": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"So war es Pflicht, die reichen Viehbest\u00e4nde und Erntevorr\u00e4te m\u00f6glichst vollst\u00e4ndig und fr\u00fchzeitig\".

Initially, it affected the administrative district of Gumbinnen, corresponding to the course of military events, the entry area of the Russian Njemen Army. North and south of it, the population remained, as they were not immediately pressured; later, however, their path was already blocked. On August 20, during the Battle of Gumbinnen, the refugee crowds waited behind the fighting German front for victory to return to their homes. But when the German troops unexpectedly began their retreat on the night of August 21, the sad procession of refugees also set in motion. Military necessities forced it to be kept in flow, as it threatened to clog all paths and endanger the operations themselves. Now, however, the movement swept everything it touched like an avalanche and swelled to an ever larger mass. This mass eventually rolled forward and slowly wiped the marching columns of the troops further and soon flooded the southern part of the K\u00f6nigsberg administrative district.\nThe retreat from Gumbinnen had already caused a desperate mood among the entire population of East Prussia, which was heightened to complete panic by two military orders necessarily associated with the decision to retreat:\nThe Army High Command believed that the flooding of the Angerapp lowlands, planned for the first days of mobilization, could no longer be postponed and issued corresponding instructions. Although they did not come to execution, as the situation was soon seen as more favorable and the stage inspector, Lieutenant General v. Heuduck, again pointed out the severe consequences, they nevertheless caused enormous unrest, especially in the affected area.\nAnother measure, however, could no longer be postponed: Given the extent and forms the war against the Central Powers had taken, the Army High Command was clear that what could still be saved for the nourishment of the army and homeland had to be saved. So it was a duty to secure the rich livestock and harvest supplies as completely and early as possible.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>in Sicherheit zu bringen.</fragment_2>", "317": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Jetzt bildeten ihre Nachkommen wiederum einen Teil der auf etwa eine halbe Million angewachsenen ostpreu\u00dfischen Fl\u00fcchtlingsscharen, die aber diesmal mitten im Kriege einem v\u00f6llig ungewissen Schicksal entgegengingen.\"\nThis sentence appears complete as it ends with a period and expresses a complete thought.\n\n<fragment_1>Jetzt bildeten ihre Nachkommen wiederum einen Teil der auf etwa eine halbe Million angewachsenen ostpreu\u00dfischen Fl\u00fcchtlingsscharen, die aber diesmal mitten im Kriege einem v\u00f6llig ungewissen Schicksal entgegengingen.</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is: \"Die Fluchtbewegung bildete f\u00fcr die Beh\u00f6rden eine schwere Sorge.\"\nThis sentence is also complete as it starts with a capital letter and ends with a period, indicating it is a separate thought.\n\n<fragment_2>Die Fluchtbewegung bildete f\u00fcr die Beh\u00f6rden eine schwere Sorge.</fragment_2>\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` is a complete sentence and ends with a period.\n- `fragment_2` is a new sentence and does not logically or grammatically continue `fragment_1`.\n- The fragments are independent and do not logically or grammatically connect into a single sentence.\n\n<decision>The fragments do not align and do not form a single coherent sentence.</decision>\n</thinking>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>322</pageno>\n<header>The Sufferings of East Prussia.</header>\n<body>to secure. Everything left behind fell into the enemy's hands and was thus lost anyway; the Russians would either use it themselves or, if they had to retreat, take it with them or destroy it. Thus, on August 22, the supply inspection ordered, based on a directive from the army high command, the withdrawal of livestock and harvest supplies behind the Vistula. However, the railways were fully occupied at this time. A comprehensive removal via the otherwise suitable and then also used waterway, both inland via the Lagoon and Nogat, as well as across the Bay of Gda\u0144sk, could not be arranged quickly. Despite all opposing considerations and the expected losses, the land route was essentially chosen. For this, the livestock present in the districts east of the Vistula was first to be gathered at collection points and then immediately moved to the western riverbank from the Vistula lowlands.\nSuch measures were not foreseen by the authorities and the population and therefore came as a complete surprise. They caused the already ongoing flight of the population to grow immeasurably. Only a few could escape in the trains available for refugees; the majority, especially the rural population, had to use the roads.\nEveryone abandoned house and home. The entire setup, the harvest, the mass of livestock was left unattended. Only the essentials could be taken on the wagons; some of the livestock was driven along. Thus, endless lines of wagons, people, and animals moved westward on all roads. Mostly older men \u2014 the others were at the front \u2014, women and children, all shared the same fate, subsisting on what they had taken with them and camping at night in already abandoned places or in the open. Without much complaint, the brave East Prussians accepted their hard fate. Fortunately, warm and dry August weather made the weeks-long life on the road somewhat bearable! Similar refugee misery had not been seen in German lands for over 180 years. Back then, about 20,000 Salzburgers, driven from house and home by religious intolerance, sought the new homeland offered to them, especially in East Prussia. Now their descendants again formed part of the approximately half a million East Prussian refugees, who this time, in the midst of war, faced a completely uncertain fate.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "318": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Neben den unerfreulichen Erscheinungen der panikartigen Massenflucht darf aber nicht vergessen werden, da\u00df auch sehr viele Einwohner zur\u00fcckkehrten, die sich schlie\u00dflich der allgemeinen Bewegung doch\".

Although there was a certain order in the refugee trains, respect for authority was in no way shaken. Most of the members of a community stayed together and followed the instructions of their local leaders. Many district administrators also accompanied their wards and tried to help by ensuring food and shelter. The Prussian government, as soon as the movement began, was concerned with providing the displaced East Prussians with accommodation in the interior of the Reich for a longer period. Everywhere, people were ready to take in these unfortunate ones, and since the movement eventually only affected part of East Prussia and half of the refugees did not even leave the province's borders, it was possible without difficulty to accommodate the refugees in the nearest provinces. What would have happened if the refugee movement had actually extended to the Vistula or even beyond, is hard to imagine.\nThe more the stream of refugees swelled, the more it became an obstacle to military operations. The urgent rail transports of the I Army Corps from the Insterburg area to the Battle of Tannenberg suffered delays because the lines were so clogged due to the refugee and evacuation movements that they could only be slowly and gradually advanced. The marches of the troops were hindered by the stream of fleeing inhabitants. Although these behaved quite sensibly when encountering the troops, the effect of a military upbringing cultivated over many generations was unmistakable. The instructions of the military police, who had to clear the way, were willingly followed, even when they demanded harsh measures. Despite their own hardship, the fleeing people gladly gave the passing soldiers some of the little they had. Yet, frictions were unavoidable: The 1st Cavalry Division found Allenburg on August 25 so hopelessly clogged with refugee columns that it had to make a long detour through enemy territory to reach its destination. Above all, the departure of the XVII Army Corps and the I Reserve Corps to the south in the days before August 26, when they crossed the westward-moving refugee movement, was severely disrupted and delayed.\nBesides the unpleasant phenomena of the panic-like mass exodus, it should not be forgotten that many inhabitants also returned, who eventually could not escape the general movement \u2014 supporting the defenders of their homeland to the best of their ability and with full commitment.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>nicht entziehen konnten \u2014 die Verteidiger ihrer Heimat nach bestem K\u00f6nnen und unter vollem Einsatz ihrer Person unterst\u00fctzt haben.</fragment_2>", "319": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die allgemeine Bekanntmachung gab wenigstens nur die Auffassung und die Absichten des Oberbefehlshabers der Njemen-Armee wieder, fanden ...\".

Among other things, the neighboring localities were held responsible for damage to railways and telegraphs and threatened with burning down, and the male population with shooting. The use of motor vehicles and bicycles as well as any traffic at night was prohibited. A particularly sharp decree was directed against foresters, who were seen as secret supporters of the German army. According to an order issued by the Russian VI Corps, they were even to be shot without further ado.\nThe Russians have in numerous cases assumed the involvement of the population with weapons in hand or through scouting services and treason, where thorough investigation would have shown that this was not the case. The statements of the suspects and any German witnesses were not believed, and often the ignorance of the foreign language made the defense of the accused more difficult. However, the punishments were ruthlessly carried out.

While the Russian is generally rightly considered good-natured and has shown himself to be simple, in surprisingly many cases the beast in man also emerged. Numerous are the cases where people were deliberately burned in the ignited houses; the bodies of those shot were left unburied; during the removal and treatment of prisoners, brutal cruelty was often used, or Asian customs were transferred to German cultural land, as a captain of the 16th Hussar Regiment, who publicly flogged 31 residents in Heinrichswalde (Niederung district, east of K\u00f6nigsberg).\nApart from the previously described courts-martial, the population also suffered severely from looting, robbery, and acts of violence of all kinds, especially against women and girls, less so in times of stronger movement, as the invading troops, less from the fighting troops than from Tainas, columns, and staging formations. The behavior of the Russian Guard Cavalry is generally given an extremely favorable testimony. There have been fewer complaints about the line troops from the western governments than about those from the interior of the empire, against whom even Russian officers occasionally warned the German population. According to all reports, the Cossacks fare particularly poorly, of whom there were at most two regiments in each Russian corps and one in each cavalry division. Perhaps the whip (Nagaika) belonging to the official equipment of the Cossacks has made these poorly disciplined and inherently harmless, steppe-dwelling children appear in such an unfavorable light, or other mounted troops have been regarded as \"Cossacks\" due to the uniformity of the Russian uniforms.\nTo prevent excesses, a strict alcohol ban was already enacted in Russia with the mobilization, which was later enforced with the utmost ruthlessness. The Russian officers, with various exceptions, have been keen to prevent acts of violence and have done so emphatically, and with weapons in hand, intervened against their own soldiers, having looting punished with knout lashes.</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>mit der Waffe in der Hand, gegen die eigenen Soldaten eingegriffen, Pl\u00fcnderungen mit Knuttenhieben bestrafen lassen.</fragment_2>", "322": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Beim Vormarsch waren durch\".

But even for the officers themselves, it was sometimes difficult to assert themselves against unruly troops, and they could not be everywhere. Thus, in villages and on individual farms, there were more riots, including not a few of truly malicious work, than in the cities, where the present command posts generally ensured stricter discipline. They were also committed to maintaining order by cooperating with any remaining German officials. Where these were absent, they appointed deputies.\nComplaints about looting in more or less large scale have been made almost everywhere. They were particularly severe where the residents had fled and left their belongings unguarded. In the uninhabited buildings, passing groups of refugees or troops might have already sought shelter, perhaps not leaving everything as they found it; shady characters from the local population had begun to loot. Then the Russians came, who systematically cleared entire buildings. According to numerous consistent reports from various circles, Polish Jews, who supplied the troops with provisions, played a major role, often being instigators. \"They arrange\" \u2014 as the reports say \u2014 \"for the soldiers to break into the homes and loot. For little money, the Jews then bought the goods.\" Long convoys with stolen household goods, valuables of all kinds, agricultural machinery, and livestock were thus taken across the border.\nHowever, a description of the behavior of the Russian troops would be incomplete if it were not mentioned that they often showed a very human side, striving to live in harmony with the remaining population and occasionally actually helping them. For example, they are said to have provided for the supply of the remaining German population in Wehlau, Johannisburg, and Neidenburg and supported the German refugees at the Alle crossing near Friedland.\nThe immediate damage from the combat operations naturally cannot be attributed to the Russians alone. These damages were also significant. Part of the first Russian incursions specifically targeted railway disruptions. During the advance, the foremost Russian reconnaissance units frequently set fire to barns and haystacks to indicate how far they had come.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>die vordersten russischen Aufkl\u00e4rungsabteilungen vielfach Scheunen und Strohmieten angez\u00fcndet, um anzuzeigen, wie weit sie gekommen seien.</fragment_2>", "323": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Das Niederbrennen von\".

Neidenburg, where allegedly residents participated in the fighting, \nwas set on fire by the Russians. Soldau, Ortelsburg, \nand many other towns suffered more or less severely from the fighting. Since in rural areas all rooms and storages were immediately \nfilled with hay and straw after the harvest, almost every \nartillery bombardment resulted in major fire damage. Numerous villages, \nespecially the village of M\u00fchlen on the battlefield of Tannenberg, and such \nin front of the eastern front of L\u00f6tzen were almost completely incinerated, a large number \nof estates and farms were destroyed. Nevertheless, the combat \ndamage of these first weeks of war does not compare to what \u2014 with more \nnumerous and effective artillery and with longer duration of \nbattles in the same area \u2014 was destroyed later in the war. \nNew sufferings and new damages were brought by the Russian retreat: \nAs long as the Russians hoped to keep the occupied land as a prize of victory, \nthey took some considerations that later fell away. As \nexpected, they deported the entire able-bodied population, \nincluding all men from 16 to 45 years of age, to Russia, while other residents were taken as hostages. In \nsome cases, even the residents of entire villages, regardless of \nage and gender, including elderly women and infants, \nwere ruthlessly and senselessly deported. Many deportees, \nwho could no longer be taken along in the hasty flight, \nwere simply shot. Moreover, the Russians aimed to \ndestroy everything that could be of use to the German war effort in the future, \nespecially all bridges, railway, telegraph, and telephone \ninstallations, as well as household institutions, factories, and supplies of all kinds. \nNaturally, overzealousness and joy in destruction also caused \ndamage that cannot be explained by reasons of warfare. \nIn some areas, such as the districts of Lyck and Marggrabowa, it is said that \nthere was even a general order to burn down all dwellings \nduring the retreat. These measures had no impact on the German \npursuit, as the destructions were nowhere so lasting due to the shortness \nof time and lack of preparation \nthat they could have stopped the pursuers.

Only now could one somewhat overlook the damage that had been done. It was hardly behind the first stories and reports. However, if one considers the destruction and suffering that are infinitely inseparably connected with the warfare of today's armies, it also becomes apparent that, beyond that, the excesses of the Russians may not have been quite as numerous, at least not as widespread, as was initially reported. For example, of the four district administrators reported as abducted, only the one from Lyck was actually taken to Russia.\nBut even so, the country and its unfortunate population had suffered severely enough under the horrors of the war. As far as can be determined, the following losses occurred in the four weeks of the Russian invasion in August/September 1914:\n1620 civilians were killed,\n433 wounded,\nover 10000 abducted.\nOf a total of 2500000 inhabitants east of the Vistula, more than 800000 suddenly left home and farm; of these, about 400000 fled across the Vistula and found temporary shelter there. More than 100000 families lost all their belongings. In terms of animals, the total loss, including the later Russian invasions, where the loss can only have been minor, was:\n135000 horses (total stock east of the Vistula about 600000),\n250000 cattle (total stock east of the Vistula about 1400000),\n200000 pigs.</body>\n<footer>1) For a clear distinction of the damages and losses from the first Russian invasion described here and those from later invasions, the documents are often lacking.

There is no question that with systematic peace preparations, the orderly evacuation of essential assets, especially the mass of the population by rail, ship, and road, would have been possible. Timely evacuation of the male population of conscription age or close to it could have been carried out even without peace preparations. However, every effort should have been made to restrict the flight of the local population as much as possible.

This army and the 2nd were now supposed to attack the enemy, who\u2014correctly recognized\u2014was pursuing parts northward. This attack was ordered on the evening of September 7 and began on the 8th. However, the troops of the 2nd and 3rd Armies were worn out from the previous unfortunate battles. Therefore, in the following days, only the extreme right wing, where the commander of the 2nd Army, General v. B\u00f6hm-Ermolli, still had new forces to deploy from the Serbian front, gained some ground.\nMeanwhile, in Poland, the resistance of the Russians at Cholm\u2014Lublin had increasingly strengthened1). The Austro-Hungarian front was also forced into defense here from pursuit and attack over time. The enemy, besides the reserve troops that had since arrived, deployed three completely fresh active corps in his 4th Army into battle, the III Caucasian Corps originally intended for the 3rd Army, as well as the Guard Corps and the XVIII from the 9th Army2). The mass, which had grown to 15 infantry divisions, was divided, and the command of the 9th Army was inserted on the western wing of the 4th Army. The Russians pressed sharply against the army group of the Archduke as well as against the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army and penetrated with strong forces into the gap that had arisen between them by the withdrawal of the 4th Army. The Austro-Hungarian front in the north began to waver. As their last reserve, the German Landwehr Corps was deployed.\nThe German Landwehr Corps under General of Infantry v.

Since the 18th Landwehr Brigade and some other units of the corps had been held at the Vistula by the army commander, General Dankl, General v. Woyrsch initially had only 25 battalions, 12 squadrons, and 9 batteries at his disposal. \u2014 The brave soldiers had marched almost 400 km from the German border in 24 days when they were integrated into the already wavering front on September 7 under the Austro-Hungarian X Corps (from Central Galicia) and the V (from Western Hungary). In broad daylight, the 4th Landwehr Division under Lieutenant General v. Wegerer relieved the exhausted Hungarian 37th Infantry Division and the Austrian 36th Landsturm Brigade in battle, broke through the previous line in the first impetuous assault, and captured more than 1000 prisoners. They encountered parts of the Russian Grenadier Corps and the 82nd Reserve Division. The Austrian 36th Landsturm Brigade was subordinated to General v. Woyrsch, but the German 3rd Landwehr Division was held by the Hungarian command of the 1st Army for other use.\nAfter strong preparation by far superior artillery, the evening of September 8 brought heavy Russian counterattacks.

The enemy broke into the artillery line of the 4th Landwehr Division standing on a height east of Tarnawat. During its defense, the commander of the German 21st Reserve Brigade, Lieutenant General v. Busse, fell. On the morning of September 9, a German counterattack, in which parts of the 3rd Landwehr Division, which had meanwhile been released, also participated, brought the fiercely contested height and the guns back into the hands of the Landwehr. The danger seemed to be overcome. Then, on the left of the Landwehr Corps \u2014 apparently due to a misunderstanding \u2014 the Hungarian V Corps began to withdraw. The enemy followed them, and thus the front of the German Landwehr Corps became untenable. Although not attacked at this time, the western flank had to be withdrawn. When it was discovered around noon that the Austrian X Corps was almost 10 km behind the German Landwehr on the right of the Landwehr Corps, General v. Woyrsch was forced to withdraw his troops despite the success just achieved. The retreat was difficult and costly in broad daylight, given the enemy flanking on both sides and soon pressing in the front. Of the 40 guns of the open artillery line of the 4th Landwehr Division, the crew could bring back eight, all others, which had already become largely unusable from previous varied fighting, had to remain because the limbers were not reachable. In addition, the three-day battle within the framework of the allied army cost the German Landwehr Corps 8000 men, including 100 officers alone; almost 7000 men were lost only to the 4th Landwehr Division. Due to the lack of medical formations, numerous wounded had to remain unattended. \u2014 Deployed under particularly unfavorable combat conditions, the German Landwehr had fought well against the Russian troops and halted the enemy's advance according to their own statements 1) from September 7 to 9.\nEven now, the Russians were only slightly superior in numbers to the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, 16 against 15 1/2 infantry divisions. However, in these numbers, there was a significant portion of fresh forces on the Russian side, while on the Austro-Hungarian side, after more than two weeks of fighting, the unfavorable composition of the divisions, especially their inferiority in artillery, became increasingly noticeable.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>ung\u00fcnstigere Zusammensetzung der Divisionen, vor allem ihre Unterlegenheit an Artillerie, immer mehr f\u00fchlbar machte.</fragment_2>", "330": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die Heeresgruppe der S\u00fcdwestfront hielt ihre Kr\u00e4fte im konzentrischen Vorgehen eng zusammen und wollte noch am 9.

But the Russians had also suffered so severely that they were just about to abandon further attacks against the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army. General Dankl found himself compelled to order the retreat at noon on September 9 due to the situation at his front. This marked a complete turnaround on the northern flank of the Austro-Hungarian army.\nHowever, this setback did not deter General v. Conrad from his stubbornly pursued plan to continue fighting for victory at Lemberg. The previous successes of the 2nd Army still gave him hope until the situation also became increasingly precarious for the Archduke's army group. This army group had been moved further west to support the 1st Army, and this had already deprived the northern flank of the 4th Army of its protection. The enemy pressed harder here. He finally seriously threatened the flank and rear of the three armies fighting with their front to the east, while they themselves, despite capturing 10,000 prisoners and 50 guns, made no significant progress. Thus, General v. Conrad reached the difficult decision at noon on September 11 to also abandon the fight on the right wing of the army. He ordered a general retreat to Przemy\u015bl and behind the San. After 17 days of heavy and costly fighting, the attack was finally abandoned. General v. Conrad had tried to turn the battle to victory to the utmost, but in vain. The combat strength and maneuverability of the subordinate troops were not up to the extremely difficult tasks set for them. Thus, the Austro-Hungarian army fell into defense at the Russian front in mid-September.\nThe Russian Supreme Command had considered the situation so favorable after the capture of Lemberg that they were already thinking of withdrawing parts from the left wing of the southwestern front and deploying them against Germany to Warsaw. The new attack by General v. Conrad put an end to such thoughts; they no longer felt secure in their success. The army group of the southwestern front kept its forces closely concentrated and still wanted to completely halt the attack of the western flank on September 9, when the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army brought them an unexpected victory.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>des Westfl\u00fcgels ganz einstellen1), als ihr der Zusammenbruch der \u00f6sterreichisch-ungarischen 1.

Without German assistance, it was considered incapable of even pure defense.\nGiven such an outcome of the initial offensive, the retrospective observer is prompted to question whether this offensive was justified at all, or whether greater restraint, perhaps defense in the Carpathians and at the San, would have been more advantageous.\nThe decision to attack between the Bug and Vistula was made in accordance with the unanimous opinion of the German and Austro-Hungarian general staff chiefs and was carefully considered in peacetime. Given the situation at the start of the war, it was entirely justified from both the German and Austro-Hungarian perspectives to disrupt the assembly of Russian masses and preempt their attack, even if, as was intended by the Germans, the initial strategy in the East was to remain largely defensive. The numerical ratio, according to the deployment plans of both sides, was initially not unfavorable for Austria-Hungary and thus supported the offensive.\nHowever, the war situation had developed differently by the start of operations than had been anticipated. The claim, made during the events and repeatedly since, that the Russians were ready earlier and stronger than calculated in peacetime is incorrect. But the Russian armies, urged by France, commenced their attack before completing their assembly, while on the Austro-Hungarian side, perhaps due to the delay in deployment, but certainly due to the preceding deployment of the 2nd Army against Serbia, valuable time was lost. There was also an inability to fully commit the planned number of divisions against Russia, and the reduced number was still held at the Serbian front until the end of August. Under these circumstances, switching to defense at the last moment was difficult. Neither the training of the army nor the education of its leaders was prepared for defending the vast spaces of the Galician theater of war, which had not been prepared for in peacetime.\nSuch a change in decision would have been disastrous in its impact on the overall situation: Defense would have helped only temporarily, not in the long run. The Russian pressure on the Austrian front would have steadily increased, the victory at the Battle of the Marne might have been possible, and the German Eastern Front, despite Tannenberg, would have been pushed into defense. In the East, it would likely have resulted in an overall situation from which one could have only freed oneself with strong assistance from the Western Front, given the meanwhile further grown Russian masses. Everything depended on this assistance.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>sichts der inzwischen weiter angewachsenen russischen Massen nur durch kr\u00e4ftige Hilfe von der Westfront wieder h\u00e4tte freimachen k\u00f6nnen.</fragment_2>", "333": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Anders lagen die Dinge bei dem Entschlu\u00df, auch \u00f6stlich Lemberg zum\".

Everything depended on this help. If it failed, as was the case after the Battle of the Marne, then there was hardly any prospect in the East of a rescue against the now fully assembled, overwhelming Russian superiority. Only if the Russian armies were attacked and defeated individually, as soon as they could be grasped, could it be prevented that they eventually grew into the \"steamroller\" that was expected by the Western powers to be unleashed on us from the East.\nThe numerical ratio on the Galician front, despite the failure of some Austro-Hungarian divisions, was still much more favorable than General v. Conrad had expected before the war. He had calculated at the time that by the Russian 30th mobilization day (= August 29) 60 enemy infantry divisions would be standing against him; in fact, by September 11, there were at most 51 divisions, including Landsturm and German Landwehr (but excluding the march brigades), at least 47\u00bd divisions stood against them on the Austro-Hungarian side. But even so, the Russian side had a considerable superiority in cavalry and, which weighed particularly heavily, also in artillery. In total, the following stood against each other:\nBattalions Squadrons Guns\nAustrians and Hungarians and German Landwehr Corps 804\u00bd 398 2140\nRussians 823\u00bd 690 3060\nBut this numerical superiority of the Russians only gradually emerged\u00b9). Thus, the decision to attack between the Bug and Vistula did not necessarily have to lead to the severe setback that actually occurred. If the Austro-Hungarian leadership had succeeded in concentrating the mass of their forces early at one point for a decisive blow, the prospects of success would probably have been significantly greater. But even as the deployment actually took place, it was not foreseeable that the Austro-Hungarian western wing, despite its initial superiority (in numbers\u00b2), would be denied a decisive success, and that it would not be able to hold the initial success achieved.

They were filled with the clear awareness that it was necessary to defend German freedom and the German way against Russian ambitions and violence. The thought, especially to protect their own closer homeland directly against the horrors of war, strengthened their will to give their all to fulfill their great but difficult task. It was a small, unified force that stood against the Russian superiority.\nAn all-encompassing enthusiasm and confidence in victory like in the West, where strong forces were preparing for decisive blows, could not easily arise among the small group of Eastern fighters. The disparity in numbers was too great. They faced an extremely difficult task, but it was also particularly honorable.\nThe sense of honor and duty, instilled over generations and reinforced in each individual through military service, was what kept even the faint-hearted upright in such a situation and led thousands willingly to death for the common great cause. Individual concerns receded into the background. Anyone who was filled with anxious thoughts on the way to battle \u2014 less about themselves than about their loved ones at home, about house and home \u2014 suppressed such thoughts. They had no place alongside the fighting spirit of the masses and had to step back before the great task to be fulfilled. The greatest mental anguish in this regard was endured by the East Prussians themselves, who had to witness the misery of their immediate compatriots, perhaps even their own relatives, daily and hear of the atrocities of the Russian invaders. And they could not help, perhaps even had to drive the unfortunate refugees from the road into the fields or onto poor side paths, as the harsh necessity of war dictated.

Many members of the furlough status, matured by their own responsibility in their profession, became a model of selfless dedication to the greater whole for their younger comrades. The troops of the 8th Army, officers as well as soldiers, were filled with the best spirit. Their resolute seriousness was perhaps the surest guarantee that they would achieve the almost superhuman, which had to be demanded of them, \u2014 that they would also overcome setbacks, should they occur, through their healthy inner strength. It was a magnificent troop that took over the watch in the East in those August days of 1914; strong faith in God, true loyalty to the warlord, and passionate love for the homeland inspired them.\nThe efficiency of German troops and leaders, not superiority in numbers, gave us victory at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes!\nThe venture of confronting the vastly superior enemy in the East with only minorities has proven justified. The view laid down by the Great General Staff before the war regarding the higher combat value of German troops has been fully confirmed. That it also applied to German reserve troops with their limited artillery in the fight against Russian active troops was not easy to foresee.\nThe awareness of their own inner superiority could not be shaken even by individual setbacks. They occurred in the first battles with almost all units. However, where a strong leadership intervened and the conditions were not particularly unfavorable, they could be immediately compensated, as with parts of the I Army Corps on August 20 and 27, and with those of the I Reserve Corps on August 20. Even the XVII Army Corps, despite the very severe shock and heavy losses on these days, was already back in the hands of its leaders and soon fully combat-ready. Only in a single Landwehr brigade did the repercussions of a setback last longer.\nReserve and Landwehr units and fortress troops, despite their less favorable composition1), competed with the active army corps in the fight against the same enemy. Even in the Landwehr, the result of thorough peacetime training was still firmly established, and they performed repeatedly better than expected. The battles of the 5th Landwehr Brigade on August 26 and 27, the attack of the 6th Landwehr Brigade on August 26, the Landwehr Division Golz on August 28, and the Landwehr Corps at Tarnawka are glorious chapters for the German Landwehr.\n</body>\n<footer>1) See the overview in Appendix 2.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>5.

Parts of them, who fought against Usdau and Soldau from August 27 to 30 under General v. Schmettau, then reached Willenberg as the first German troops on the 31st after a forced march of 60 km during the pursuit. \u2014 The I Army Corps was in motion almost continuously from the beginning of the border battles on August 10 until the conclusion of the pursuit on September 14. In these 36 days, it had no fewer than 23 days of combat, including Stallup\u00f6nen, Gumbinnen, Usdau, and Neidenburg, as well as a rail transport, from which it partly entered the battle directly from the railway cars. Nevertheless, it carried out the overtaking pursuit relentlessly at Tannenberg and at the Masurian Lakes, swinging widely on the outer flank.\nThe Russians could repeatedly send new troops into battle; on the German side, the same divisions had to be led against the enemy again even after heavy losses. They marched and fought alternately against the east and the south, sometimes against this, sometimes against that enemy. This was only possible with formations that were so agile and in the hands of their leaders as the German troops of 1914, and even with these only because everyone, from the highest leader to the last man, had the great cause exclusively in mind.\nThe losses were heavy, yet small compared to those of the enemy. They amounted, as already mentioned\u00b9), in East Prussia up to September 15, to a total of about 37,000 men. In the first encounters with the enemy and in battles without full victory, the losses were naturally particularly large. In the victorious battle of Tannenberg, in which 11\u00bd divisions fought for six days, only about 12,000 men were lost in total, thus fewer than in the battle of Gumbinnen, where 7 divisions fought for only one day but lost about 14,000 men. Relatively even higher losses are shown by the battles of the Landwehr Corps ending with a retreat: 2 divisions lost over 8,000 men in two days of combat in total.\nAll branches of the armed forces contributed to the great successes.</body>\n<footer>\u00b9) p. 317.</footer>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2></fragment_2>", "340": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"So stiegen ihre Ver-\".

As long as they were dealing with the enemy infantry alone, they did not feel dependent on support from their own artillery. It sufficed if their sister arm kept the enemy artillery fire at bay. They managed the opposing infantry on their own. They worked with rifles and machine guns, as they had learned in long, arduous peacetime training. With rifle headshots, the Russian defenders lay in their trenches. If they wanted to avoid this, they had to duck, but then fell into the hands of the advancing German infantry as prisoners. Certainly, these attacks by our brave foot troops against the well-armed, tenacious, and bravely fighting enemy demanded heavy sacrifices. Perhaps the losses were occasionally greater than necessary. And yet, one would not want to miss the momentum of attack of our infantry at that time. Their bold and relentless advance made a deep impression on the enemy, and a large part of the successes is owed to it alone: When the infantry of the 41st Infantry Division was unleashed against the enemy south of M\u00fchlen for the first time on August 26, the Russian commander did not even have time to bring his artillery into position. And we see the same eagerness to attack when, two days later, the 3rd Reserve Division and the Landwehr Division Golds advanced to attack. The first had only six light batteries, the other on the battlefield only a single battery. In the reserve and Landwehr men, but especially in their officers, there was still the spirit of attack instilled in thorough peacetime training. Their advance brought the decision at Hohenstein on August 28, before the Russian XIII Corps could intervene. The 3rd Reserve Division continued their successful attacks with six light batteries, as on September 7 at Bialla and on the 9th east of Klaussen. As in almost all times, the foot troops bore the brunt of the battle. But they also appear in the casualty lists of the East Prussian August and September battles with a large margin ahead of all other arms. About 32% of the losses fell on the officers, who thus lost about 2\u00bd times as much of their total number as the non-commissioned officers and men. They were primarily the bearers of the will to attack and accordingly had to expose themselves the most, more so in the less cohesive reserve and Landwehr troops than in the active units. Thus, their losses increased, for example, during the attack of the 6th Landwehr Brigade on August 26 to about 10% of the total losses of this brigade.</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>luste z.

This also brought the German artillery into full effect. Conditions were more favorable for them than for the infantry. Although the shooting skills of the Russian artillery, trained according to the French model, were quite good and certainly equal to the German ones. On the German side, the indispensable equipment for firing from concealed positions, such as observation and telephone equipment, was not particularly abundant, especially in the reserve and Landwehr batteries, but they had superiority in the total number of guns and especially in heavy guns: Of the 612 guns of the Russian units involved in the Battle of Tannenberg, only 48 were 12 cm and 16 were 15 cm howitzers, \u2014 of the 728 German ones, however, 120 were heavy (15 cm) howitzers, and among the German light guns, there were another 120 light (10.5 cm) howitzers. At Gumbinnen, the artillery superiority of the German side was even greater, but at the Masurian Lakes, it was less. In this latter battle, it was also balanced to a significant extent by the skillful integration of the enemy standing in fortified positions; only on the decisive wing east of L\u00f6tzen could the German command bring their artillery superiority to bear. \u2014 The well-aimed shooting of individual German batteries, as well as the uniformly directed fire of larger artillery units, contributed significantly to the decision everywhere, sometimes even almost alone. On August 19, the mounted detachment of the 1st Cavalry Division drove off the entire Russian cavalry corps. On August 30, near Neidenburg, German artillery fire alone prevented the development of the Russians and thus their attack. At the XVII Army Corps on August 26 near Gro\u00df-B\u00f6ssau and at the I on August 27 before Usdau, the tenacity of the infantry paved the way so that they could finally penetrate the enemy positions without great losses. But such a procedure took time, which also benefited the enemy: at Gro\u00df-B\u00f6ssau as at Usdau, he could withdraw his main forces without waiting for the storm of our infantry.\nIn cavalry, the Russians were far superior.

Thus, the 1st Cavalry Division\u2014initially the only higher German cavalry unit in the East\u2014was faced with an extremely difficult task. The division did everything to meet it. But their forces had already been extremely strained by smaller skirmishes, reconnaissance, and security tasks in the border area before the Battle of Gumbinnen. Moreover, the division itself was missing an entire regiment (Cuirassier Regiment 5, in border protection with the XX Army Corps). The multitude of tasks had therefore been distributed among only 20 squadrons. In view of the vastly superior enemy and under the command of a commanding general who, himself ruthlessly active, also demanded the utmost from the cavalry, the three weeks of border protection had taken their toll on horse and rider, especially the best of them, almost to exhaustion. And then came the days from August 19 to 21, during which the division, apart from smaller skirmishes and the attack at Pillkallen, covered 190 km as a closed unit. However, this exhausted their strength. They could only be partially regained by the end of the battle at the Masurian Lakes. The 8th Cavalry Division, which arrived late, was not much better off after the previous efforts in the West. This was one reason why both divisions were unable to fully realize the hopes tied to their pursuit after the battle at the Masurian Lakes.\nOn the Tannenberg battlefield, the German 8th Army relied on the individual cavalry regiments of the infantry divisions. The way was clear for the enemy riders. However, the Russians did not understand how to take advantage of this favorable situation. Thus, their cavalry neither intervened in the battle of the other arms nor accomplished anything significant in solving independent tasks or in reconnaissance of their strength. They failed everywhere to prevent the reconnaissance of the German divisional cavalry. Even German reserve and landwehr riders were able to significantly support the command with timely and reliable reports. Above all, it was granted to the two cavalry regiments of the I Army Corps to brilliantly solve a task corresponding to the nature of the weapon in the overtaking pursuit on August 29 and 30.\nAirships and aircraft, the latter still in the early stages of their development, were already more significant for reconnaissance at that time than the cavalry, for they could see into the depth of the enemy's force grouping.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>die Kavallerie, denn sie konnten in die Tiefe der feindlichen Kr\u00e4ftegruppierung sehen.</fragment_2>", "343": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Die damalige Ausstattung der Kommando-Beh\u00f6rden mit Nachrichtenmitteln war zu gering, um,\" which translates to \"The then equipment of the command authorities with communication means was too limited to,\".

Their reports therefore became increasingly decisive for assessing the overall operational situation as well as for reconnaissance on the battlefield itself. The German air forces were probably superior to the Russians in number, but certainly in skill. The enemy's counteraction was minimal. Only the Posen airship Z. 5 and one aircraft fell victim to enemy fire. Nevertheless, due to their relatively small number compared to the expanse of the theater of war and the then still significant dependence on weather, the air forces could not provide such a seamless spatial and temporal picture of the enemy as became standard in later years of the war. Erroneous reports were also made, while others did not receive the attention they deserved, reaching the troops late or not at all. Despite such difficulties inherently associated with the emergence of a new means of warfare, the German command was decisively supported, especially by the aviators, and kept accurately informed about the overall situation almost without interruption. We know little about Russian aerial reconnaissance; it seems to have failed. At Tannenberg, a Russian aircraft was shot down from the ground, which was supposed to establish the connection between the Russian VI and XIII Corps on August 27; from the battle at the Masurian Lakes, the shooting down of three Russian aircraft by German infantry (on September 10 south of Darkehmen) is reported.\nThe pioneers could not always receive a task corresponding to their nature during the days of the mobile war. As far as they were given one, they solved it. Moreover, they attacked alongside the infantry and took full part in their successes and merits.\nCommand and communication transmission on the German side often encountered difficulties that were not expected in their own country. There was no reliable dependence on the existing wire lines, as officials and equipment, out of concern for the Russians, had been withdrawn early in many cases according to existing instructions.

It was added that traffic with motor vehicles was also hindered. The stream of refugees often held them up for hours and forced them to take long detours. Nevertheless, the connection on the German side, thanks to the tireless efforts of all involved, was rarely interrupted for more than half a day. \u2014 The situation was probably worse for the Russians, who were fighting in enemy territory. They have therefore often tried to help themselves with radio messages, but often omitted encryption, especially with the XIII Corps during the Battle of Tannenberg, because the correct cipher key was missing. As a result, German radio stations were able to intercept and bring important Russian radio messages to the attention of the German leadership in some cases.\nThe supply and evacuation of the wounded as well as the supply of ammunition and provisions were carried out smoothly on the German side, a good performance during the army's two-time front change from east to south and then back to east. As far as is known, only one division, the 41st, temporarily complained about the absence of provisions, especially about a multi-day shortage of bread. Other units, such as the XVII Army Corps, had to manage for almost 14 days without their own supply train. \u2014 The Russian supply worked poorly. They see this as a significant reason for their defeats. Parts of the Narew Army, according to Russian prisoner letters, have not received bread or warm provisions since the 18th, others since August 21st, and have only lived on hardtack and field crops.\nThe achievements of the German troops, their successes even in fighting against superior enemy forces, formed the solid foundation on which the leadership could build their victories. Despite occasional disagreements and frictions, the high command was supported by its subordinates in such an exemplary manner, as was only possible with a unified understanding of the principles of warfare. This was common to all higher leaders and their general staff officers.\nThe commanding generals and independently commanding leaders have fully demonstrated their skills and influence for the benefit of the great cause. Without their understanding and self-initiated cooperation, without their willing readiness to help where it was needed, a Tannenberg would have been impossible.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>zusammenwirken, ohne ihre freudige Bereitwilligkeit, zu helfen, wo es n\u00f6tig war, w\u00e4re ein Tannenberg unm\u00f6glich gewesen.</fragment_2>", "345": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is:\n\"Dieser Wille brachte sich zur Geltung auf Grund zutreffenden Urteils \u00fcber das M\u00f6gliche und entsprechender Vorsicht, wo Gefahr drohte; er\"\nThis sentence ends with \"er\", which suggests it is incomplete and likely continues onto the next page.\n\n<fragment_1>Dieser Wille brachte sich zur Geltung auf Grund zutreffenden Urteils \u00fcber das M\u00f6gliche und entsprechender Vorsicht, wo Gefahr drohte; er</fragment_1>\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe first sentence at the top of `<german_page_2>` is:\n\"wirkte sich aus in dem Zusammenfassen auch der letzten Kr\u00e4fte auf dem entscheidenden Punkt und in einem unerm\u00fcdlichen Tatendrang, der auch die Lauen und Widerstrebenden in seinen Bann zwang.\"\nThis sentence appears to logically and grammatically continue `fragment_1`, completing the thought.\n\n<fragment_2>wirkte sich aus in dem Zusammenfassen auch der letzten Kr\u00e4fte auf dem entscheidenden Punkt und in einem unerm\u00fcdlichen Tatendrang, der auch die Lauen und Widerstrebenden in seinen Bann zwang.</fragment_2>\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` ends with \"er\", indicating it is incomplete.\n- `fragment_2` begins with \"wirkte sich aus\", which continues the action described in `fragment_1`.\n- Combining them forms a coherent sentence: \"Dieser Wille brachte sich zur Geltung auf Grund zutreffenden Urteils \u00fcber das M\u00f6gliche und entsprechender Vorsicht, wo Gefahr drohte; er wirkte sich aus in dem Zusammenfassen auch der letzten Kr\u00e4fte auf dem entscheidenden Punkt und in einem unerm\u00fcdlichen Tatendrang, der auch die Lauen und Widerstrebenden in seinen Bann zwang.\"\n\n<decision>The fragments align and form a coherent sentence.</decision>\n</thinking>\n\n<english_page_1_new>\n<pageno>352</pageno>\n<header>The Achievements of the Troops and Their Leaders.</header>\n<body>\nto cooperate, without their willing readiness to help where necessary, a Tannenberg would have been impossible.\nThat the victory of Tannenberg took on such immense proportions is primarily the merit of the German Army High Command. The commander-in-chief, who gladly took on the responsibility, and his chief of staff, who made the proposals, share in this.\nCertainly, the deficiencies in the opponent's leadership, especially in the Battle of Tannenberg, made the task easier for the German High Command. The immense success would hardly have been possible without the mistakes and failures of the Russians. It could not be achieved again at the Masurian Lakes, where the enemy awaited the attack in fortified positions and behaved cautiously.\nThe interception of Russian radio messages benefited the German leadership, although in some cases it led to misdirection and concerns that were unfounded. It should also not be overlooked that the precise knowledge of the enemy's far superior strength on August 24, just before the start of the German attack at Tannenberg, could become a danger and, with less determined leadership, could easily shake the decision to battle. On the whole, however, the German leadership regarded the intercepted radio messages as highly welcome intelligence. The Army High Command was thereby temporarily, and especially at the beginning of the Battle of Tannenberg, informed of the enemy's intentions in a way that is rare in war. However, the decisive decisions and orders for the battle were made, according to the unanimous recollection of all involved, independently of the radio messages that became known on the morning of August 25. It is not to be assumed that the course of the battle would have been different without these radio messages. At the Masurian Lakes, the radio messages were missing, and yet the German leadership did not relent here, perhaps even went to work more vigorously.\nThe High Command of the 8th Army was a unified whole, especially since General v. Hindenburg took command with General Ludendorff as chief of staff. In this high staff, each individual worked in an exemplary manner at the place assigned to him for success. All subordinate leaders, however, felt a strong and determined will above them.\nThis will manifested itself based on accurate judgment of what was possible and appropriate caution where danger threatened; it manifested itself in the consolidation of even the last forces at the decisive point and in an unremitting drive for action that also captivated the indifferent and resistant.\n</body>\n</english_page_1_new>\n<fragment_2>wirkte sich aus in dem Zusammenfassen auch der letzten Kr\u00e4fte auf dem entscheidenden Punkt und in einem unerm\u00fcdlichen Tatendrang, der auch die Lauen und Widerstrebenden in seinen Bann zwang.</fragment_2>", "346": "<thinking>\nStep 1: Identify `fragment_1` from the bottom of `german_page_1`.\nThe last sentence at the bottom of `<german_page_1>` is: \"Ostpreu\u00dfen war befreit!\" This is a complete sentence, ending with an exclamation mark, indicating it is not a fragment.\n\nStep 2: Identify `fragment_2` from the top of `german_page_2`.\nThe top of `<german_page_2>` contains only the header \"Anlagen.\" There is no continuation of a sentence from `<german_page_1>`.\n\nStep 3: Validate whether the fragments align:\n- `fragment_1` is a complete sentence and does not require any continuation.\n- There is no `fragment_2` that continues `fragment_1` from `<german_page_2>`.\n- Therefore, there is no fragmentation issue between `<german_page_1>` and `<german_page_2>`.\n\n<decision>The fragments do not align and do not form a single coherent sentence.

Otherwise, this leadership knew no fixed rules: whether breakthrough or encirclement, it was indifferent to it, \u2014 as long as the goal was achieved. Every recognized opportunity was immediately seized and exploited with all means. Only in this way was it possible to turn things for the better in East Prussia despite the overwhelming enemy superiority.\nOn the eastern theater of war, despite the victory of the Russians in Galicia, the success was on the side of the Central Powers. However, it was only a defensive success. More than that had never been expected before the intervention of significant parts of the German Western Army. The Russians had not succeeded in crushing the Eastern Front of the Central Powers under the pressure of their masses. The northern wing of the Russian attack front was shattered, and thus the possibility arose, despite the lack of support from the West, to bring aid to the allies. The hope of the Russians for an easy and quick victory was destroyed; they had suffered heavier losses not only in East Prussia but also in Galicia. Instead of 1.7 million, by mid-September they had only 1.1 million fighters at the extreme front. So they had to prepare for another tough struggle. However, this meant a significant advantage for the Central Powers, as German leadership and German troops had shown themselves superior in a way that astonished both friend and foe alike. The high esteem in which Generaloberst v. Hindenburg and his soldiers were held had to replace the missing battalions in the East in the future.\nThe weak German forces had achieved tremendous feats: they had not only drawn the overwhelming enemy upon themselves and thereby relieved the front of the allies beyond expectations, but also cleansed German land of the Russian invaders through unparalleled successes:\nEast Prussia was liberated!\n</body>\n<footer>World War.
