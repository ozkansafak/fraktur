Then a longer pause in fighting occurred on the right flank of the 7th Army.

      "From mid-March to mid-May, nine infantry divisions and two cavalry divisions from the Western Army had been transferred to the German Eastern Front. Whether additional forces could be withdrawn from the western theater of war in favor of the East was something General von Falkenhayn wanted to decide only during the course of defending against the expected enemy attack. His decisive consideration was that a return of forces from the East to restore the situation on the Western front had to be avoided if at all possible, as long as operations against Russia continued to show promising progress.\n",
      "Additionally, the development of the political situation in Italy, Turkey, and the Balkans could have a significant influence on decisions at the Western Front and in Galicia. Therefore, in May 1915, it demanded particular attention from the military leadership of the Central Powers.\n",
      "The great tension of those days was vividly expressed in the exchange of opinions between both Chiefs of General Staff. In two letters in quick succession to General von Conrad on April 30 and May 2, General von Falkenhayn urged new and urgent concessions to the demands of the Italian government⁵). On May 4, Kaiser Wilhelm supported this approach by taking a similar step with his imperial ally.\n",

It simultaneously protected the route to Petersburg. When the German advance began at the end of April, cavalry was added to the Riga-Schaullen Group as reinforcement, then infantry, and finally, as the forces grew, a special army command was established north of the Njemen, similar to the German side.\n",

      "By mid-June, about 5½ German divisions faced more than 13 Russian divisions, and five against eight cavalry divisions. The German leadership succeeded in diverting far superior enemy forces from the main theater of war with minimal own effort and capturing about 40,000 prisoners in total⁴). The battles were conducted by both sides over a wide area and without a pronounced focus. On the Russian side, General Alexeyev, the commander-in-chief of the Northwestern Front, sharply criticized this type of warfare and attributed the lack of success to it. On the German side, the commander-in-chief of the East expressed a similar opinion on June 7th⁵).

On the other hand, a decisive blow is only possible from the Kowno area, although unfortunately a lot of time has been lost for this. I therefore urgently request again a reinforcement of my left flank, in order to either become offensive depending on the outcome or at least to hold the territory gained so far. I emphasize once again that I have seen the only possibility of destroying the enemy in the offensive of my left flank against the connections and rear of the enemy.

An early attack was all the more urgent as the most important preparation for a deep thrust over Wilna into the rear of the Russian army fighting in Poland.\n",
      "In June, the 10th Army<sup>4</sup> had already moved its positions closer to the fortress by pushing forward below and above against the Njemen. On June 20, the Commander-in-Chief East had expected to have the necessary troops and combat resources ready for the attack by early July, when the decision made in Poland on July 2 temporarily led to the suspension of these preparations<sup>5</sup>. At that time, the 10th Army was under Colonel General von Eichhorn<sup>6</sup>, after regrouping the often mixed units from the previous battles, with seven infantry and three cavalry divisions<sup>6</sup> extending 60 kilometers with the right wing southwest of Augustów, with the left on the Njemen below Kowno, where the Njemen Army joined west of the Dubissa estuary.</body>\n",

He had already left the fortress on August 17 and was sentenced to severe punishment by a military court for his failure. Moreover, according to General Danilow, the fall of the fortress was \"one of the most severe blows of the last war period, both in moral terms and regarding its influence on the further situation of our armies.\"\n",

Based on intelligence about measures during the Balkan Wars of 1912/13, the memorandum further explained that this \"war preparation period\" allowed, in times of political tension, \"to assign supplementary personnel and horses to the troops before the start of actual mobilization\" and to prepare these units to such an extent that they could ultimately be ready to march on the 1st or 2nd day of mobilization. The possibility had to be considered that the Russians might try to compensate for the Central Powers' head start in deployment in this way and thereby call into question an initial success for them. In 1914, the German General Staff expected that Russia — without the 7½ Siberian and Turkestan corps, which might be tied down in the East but would in any case arrive late on the European theater of war — would initially deploy its army in the following strength¹): Field forces: 30 Corps with 59 active Infantry Divisions and 12 active Rifle Brigades, further 35 Reserve Divisions, total of 100 Infantry Divisions²) and 35½ Cavalry and Cossack Divisions with a total strength of . . . . . . . . . . . 2,712,000 men, further 40 Territorial (Landwehr) Divisions as well as garrison troops and replacement troops of the active army with a total strength of . . . . . . . 929,000 \" All in all (without Siberian and Turkestan troops) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,641,000 men.

The army high command now expected a total of five Russian corps: the II south of Marggrabowa, — then an unknown one that had advanced over Filipowo, — the IV near the Rominten Heath, — the III at Stallupönen, — the XX at and north of Schirwindt. In front of these corps, the Russian cavalry corps was assumed to be west of Pillkallen. Their outposts blocked the Gynmenis section. On August 19, the German troops in the Angerapp position also expected the enemy attack and continued the fortification work. The commander-in-chief himself discussed the defense in the field with the commanding generals of the I Reserve Corps and the XVII Army Corps. At the I Army Corps, the planned movements proceeded in the morning without disturbance by the enemy. Against the northern flank of the 1st Infantry Division, however, a comprehensive Russian attack seemed to be preparing from Mallwischken. As long as the 2nd Infantry Division had not yet arrived behind this flank, the 1st Cavalry Division formed the only reserve there. Therefore, by order of the army high command, the 2nd Landwehr Brigade was initially to advance from Kraupischken to Mallwischken in the flank and rear of the encircling enemy. — In front of the entire front of the I Army Corps, the enemy slowly advanced. The high command was informed that he had occupied Augustównen (southeast of Gumbinnen); this meant a threat to the I Army Corps also from the south! However, General von Francois still assumed that the enemy wanted to encircle from the north. He suspected at least 1½ Russian corps (III and ½ XX), as well as 3 cavalry divisions, in front of his front, — perhaps the Guard Rifle Brigade was also still opposite. So far, only artillery had engaged on the German side. The next morning, General v. Francois intended to launch the 2nd Infantry Division against the enemy's northern flank over Mallwischken to Kattenau. He personally reported this intention and the situation to the commander-in-chief of the border protection and informed the intelligence officers of the high command in the same sense. He requested that the I Reserve Corps and the XVII Army Corps be deployed for the attack.</body></b>"

       "The lake again, while he remained inactive further west. — When cannon thunder was heard again from 3:30 in the morning at the General Command, General v. Scholtz began to doubt whether the withdrawal had succeeded. However, he now had the 3rd Reserve Division advance on his own responsibility towards Hohenstein to have it ready for an attack. Meanwhile, the 37th Infantry Division could be withdrawn from the enemy undisturbed. The Russians only encountered parts of the 75th Infantry Brigade at Frankenau, which could escape them under the protection of their artillery. By 8 a.m., the withdrawing German security forces were in front. He also could no longer endanger the withdrawal of the 37th Infantry Division, but the threatening encirclement became increasingly noticeable. By 10 a.m., it was known that a Russian regiment was advancing against Persing, an infantry brigade against Kurken. West of the Kownaten Lake, the enemy also advanced late on the morning of August 24. Strong Russian cavalry, which wanted to ride north over Usbau around 9 a.m., was dispersed by German artillery fire. Flyers reported about a cavalry division marching on Usdau, another equally strong column marching on Groß-Schläfken. An attack did not yet seem imminent here. Meanwhile, the 37th Infantry Division continued its movements. Large parts marched due to a misunderstanding beyond the position intended by the General Command and reached close to Hohenstein. Thus, the left wing of the division was still not firmly established on the afternoon of August 24. On the other hand, the enemy had barely advanced beyond the previous German position. On the same day, intercepted Russian radio messages confirmed the serious danger that had threatened the 37th Infantry Division. They revealed that the entire Russian XIII Corps on August 24 had already wanted to reach the area behind the 37th Infantry Division by 9 a.m. from Persing. Caught by the Russian XV Corps in the south, by the XIII from the east, the German division would have been in a dire situation in its old position early on August 24. Thanks to timely evasion, it was able to escape the threatening encirclement with tolerable own losses, in total about 1500 men, after having given the enemy a strong lesson: The Russian 1st Brigade of the 8th Infantry Division had left 100 prisoners and 1 flag in the hands of the Vorcfschen Jäger at Orlau and had retreated five kilometers to Grünfließ during the night; we do not know their bloody losses.\n",

Their Grenadier Regiment I had, after an advance it had made from the north towards this place, returned to Wansen. The enemy was not facing the troops of the German I Army Corps with advanced detachments, but its main forces seemed to be entrenched in the line Groß-Tauersee—Usdau. At the General Command of the XX Army Corps, it was already clear on the night of August 26, after the telephone conversation with the I Army Corps, that the attack there would not begin as early as ordered by the Army High Command. Therefore, an order to advance the right wing on Groß-Grieben—Jankowitz was initially not given. They waited. Thus, the Army High Command had to come to terms with the delay that had occurred at the I Army Corps. The Russians remained quiet throughout the morning. However, it became increasingly clear that between the enemy, who was facing the German I Army Corps at Usdau, and the western flank of the enemy reported in front of the XX Army Corps at Jankowitz to Groß-Gardeinen, there was a large gap. This offered the possibility to launch the attack of the XX Army Corps without waiting for the I Army Corps, thereby facilitating its task. Therefore, General v. Hindenburg ordered, as soon as he received the report at 10 a.m. of the capture of Groß-Koschlaus and Seebens by the I Army Corps, that the XX Army Corps should now \"advance to attack between the Great Damerau Lake and Mühlen Lake over the approximate line Ganshorn²)—Thymaul with a strong right wing.\" An immediate support of the I Army Corps by a partial advance of the XX Army Corps on Usdau seemed no longer necessary to the High Command. If it became necessary later, it could be conducted more effectively from the area west of Ganshorn. While the right flank of the XX Army Corps attacked, the left north of the Mühlen Lake was initially to be held back, to follow later as a reserve. When this army order reached the XX Army Corps, reports were already present here, according to which on both sides of the Mühlen Lake, the advance of strong Russian forces against the positions of the 37th Infantry Division became noticeable.\n",

       "<body>at least three Russian divisions in front of his line. Further south, it suspected the enemy identified at Bujaken to be the Russian XXIII Corps. However, this corps was considered so heavily beaten that it was not expected to have significant offensive power. To align with the intentions of the Army High Command, the 41st Infantry Division had received orders to advance around Lake Mühlen towards Paulsgut, to get behind the Russians, reaching the line Lutten—Ganshorn (east of Mühlen) by 4 a.m. The division was to “avoid the threat from Bujaken by marching in the darkness” and “deploy a strong rearguard with artillery.” As soon as its attack became noticeable at Paulsgut, the troops deployed at the Drewenz front were to launch an attack. They were all subordinated to the commander of the 3rd Reserve Division for August 28. The 37th Infantry Division was to be ready by 4 a.m. west of Reichenau in the line Kittnau—Glanden and attack Colony Plattienen (on the Höhensteiner road). No time was set for this attack; it depended, like everything, on the progress of the attack by the 41st Infantry Division. The 41st Infantry Division had received the corps order issued on August 27 at 10:45 p.m. by 11:20 p.m. The mission assigned to it was a daring undertaking, but with thorough reconnaissance and preparation with fresh troops under determined leadership, it could achieve a brilliant success and decide the day. However, almost all these prerequisites were missing: The troops were overstrained and tired, they had no time for preparation, the situation with the enemy was quite unclear, and contact with them no longer existed. Adamsheide, at the eastern end of Lake Mühlen, was reported to be firmly occupied, and resistance was also expected at the Maranse near Waplitz. Thus, Major General Sonntag had serious concerns about this order from the General High Command. However, there had already been disagreements with the superior command during the day. The division had finally declared the previously mentioned order at 6 p.m., “to advance over Waplitz today with all forces,” as impracticable. After General Sonntag repeatedly expressed his concerns about the advance on Waplitz, but considered further objections to the current order hopeless, he wanted to try to make the best of it and hoped for good luck. He arranged for the morning of August 28 to command a total of 9 battalions, 2 squadrons, and 13 batteries.</body></b>"

Military history has no example of a similar achievement to show — at Cannae, the threat from the rear was missing. The magnitude of the success is best characterized by a comparison of the mutual losses and the extent of the booty. The total losses amounted, including the battle at Gumbinnen and Orlau on August 23, as far as they have been determined so far: on the German side, a total of about 12,000 men, on the Russian side, one must reckon with more than ten times that number. While on the German side only about 7% of the strength of the fighting troops were lost, the losses on the Russian side rose to about 75%. In addition, about 350 guns fell as booty, as well as an abundant, but no longer ascertainable number of horses, machine guns, field kitchens, and other vehicles of all kinds into the hands of the victors. This booty made it possible to significantly improve the field equipment, especially of the German Landwehr and reserve troops, and thereby increase their combat value. Also, the relatively very low German losses of officers and men could be replenished to a large extent quickly. — Thus, the 8th Army stood after the Battle of Tannenberg in proud awareness of the incomparable victory achieved and in the secure feeling of its superiority over the enemy, ready in full strength for new deeds. Different on the Russian side: The army leader dead, his staff fled on foot across the border, two commanding generals captured, the other three relieved of their positions, of five corps only 2½ escaped the encirclement, but they too were defeated and severely weakened in their combat strength by heavy losses. However, these losses could not be replaced as quickly given their extent and the then still unfavorable Russian supply conditions as on the German side. The Russian Narew Army was eliminated for a long time; what weighed even more heavily: under the overwhelming impression of the immense defeat, the not too great confidence in victory, which was already not very high, dwindled.</body>\n",

       "Reconnaissance found the terrain up to the Narew free from the enemy. According to agent reports, troops were supposed to have been transported from Warsaw by rail to the east. However, the Russian Guard Corps, previously suspected near Warsaw, had to be assumed to be in front of the German Landwehr Corps in southern Poland according to a report. Thus, no disturbance was expected from the Narew for the time being. A threat to the German encircling wing from the south and east, however, became increasingly apparent: reports of the assembly of Russian troops at Schtschutschin and Grajewo were available from aviators. There, it initially seemed to involve only weaker forces, individual brigades or regiments. While the parts of the 1st and 3rd Finnish Rifle Brigade defeated at Bialla had retreated to the northeast, aviators now observed new opponents from Lyk marching northwest towards Neu-Jucha. At least the Russian XXII Corps from Finland (consisting of 4 rifle brigades of 8 battalions each) had to be assumed in the southeastern corner of East Prussia, but probably also other new Russian forces. In front of the encircling group's front, however, only the Russian 43rd Infantry Division (from the II Corps) was detected on September 8, now with both brigades. North of the lakes, the enemy remained calm in their fortified position as before. The strong reserves at Insterburg (a corps) and along the roads from there to the front were again detected by aviators on September 8. Agents had observed the approach of two more reserve divisions (54th and 55th) near Tilsit in recent days. Therefore, the possibility was still strongly considered that the enemy, perhaps after the arrival of these reinforcements, might transition to an attack with their northern wing. The most effective countermeasure was the rapid execution of the German attack on the southern wing. For this, the army command wanted to utilize everything at hand. The defense against the threat from Schtschutschin and Lyk had to take a back seat and was to be left to the Landwehr Division Goltz. Thus, for September 9, the 3rd Reserve Division, which was assumed not at Drygallen but already at Klaussen, was set on Neu-Jucha, where it was to meet the enemy reported advancing from Lyk. The I Army Corps was to visibly continue the attack movement north of the Goldap Geg-Sea. General v. François was now given command of the army cavalry (2/3 1st and 8th Cavalry Division). It was to be under the command of the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, Lieutenant General Brecht, to be united into a cavalry corps at Widminnen on September 9 and advance on Goldap.\n",

The XXII Corps was to advance a vanguard against Johannisburg, while the III Siberian had to initially detach its foremost division, the 8th Siberian Rifle Division, to occupy the Narew positions Ossowjez and Lomsha. On September 7, the Northwest Front army group received the first surprising news that a German infantry division and a cavalry brigade were advancing eastward along the East Prussian southern border. They recognized the strong and wide German encircling movement and thereupon ordered the advance of the available parts of the 10th Army from Lyck and Lomsha towards Arzys and Johannisburg, and the 2nd Army against Myszyniec-Hortkiele. Meanwhile, on the evening of the same September 7, the vanguard of the XXII Corps (parts of the 1st and 3rd Finnish Rifle Brigade) had already arrived at Bialla and was partly thrown back towards Grajewo, partly northward³). On the same day, the German radio message about the unloading of the Guard Corps and V Army Corps at Königsberg was intercepted, and increased German activity was noticed at the Deime. Thus, the Northwest Front army group was uncertain on September 8: General v. Rennenkampf, who himself considered his position secure until then, was to retreat to Gumbinnen if necessary, and the corps of the 10th Army \"in case of advance of significant enemy forces\" to Augustow and Grajewo.</body>\n",
