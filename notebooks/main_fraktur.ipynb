      "To keep the scope of the complete work \"The World War 1914—1918\" within reasonable limits, a strict focus on the essentials was an unavoidable necessity. The presentation has aimed to highlight, by excluding less important events, the major lines of development of the war events, both in terms of operational warfare and the events at the battlefronts. While the depiction of the events of the first five months of the war, with the extremely varied course of the war of movement in the West and East, comprised no less than six volumes, the military operations of the entire war year 1915, which only show movement in the East and pure trench warfare in the West, are to be presented in three volumes. The events of the war years 1916 and 1917 are expected to be described much more briefly, while the year 1918, so significant for the outcome of the war, will again be given more space.\n",
      "The decisions of the Supreme Army Command in the winter and spring of 1915 were significantly influenced by the development of political events, particularly by the negotiations of the Central Powers with Italy. To make the motives of the warfare understandable, it was therefore necessary to address these negotiations, but only insofar as the Supreme Army Command was involved in them. The presentation does not claim to provide a complete account of the political events of that time; it is only a partial excerpt from the overall action, which naturally cannot always fully account for the thoughts and motives of the political leadership. This approach will also have to be adhered to in the later publications of the Reichsarchiv.</body>\n",

      "<body>The present Volume VII describes the military operations of the winter and spring of 1915. To keep the scope of the complete work \"The World War 1914—1918\" within appropriate limits, strict limitation to the essential was an unavoidable necessity. The presentation has endeavored, by excluding less important events, to illustrate above all the major lines of development of the war events, both of the operational warfare and of the events at the battlefronts. While the depiction of the events of the first five months of the war, with the extremely changeable course of the war of movement in the West and East, comprised no fewer than six volumes, the military operations of the entire war year 1915, which show movement only in the East, but pure trench warfare in the West, are to be presented in three volumes. The events of the war years 1916 and 1917 are expected to be described even more briefly, while the year 1918, so significant for the outcome of the war, is to be given broader coverage again.\n",
      "The decisions of the Supreme Army Command in the winter and spring of 1915 were significantly influenced by the development of political events, particularly by the negotiations of the Central Powers with Italy. To make the motives of the warfare understandable, it was therefore necessary to address these negotiations, insofar as the Supreme Army Command was involved in them. The presentation does not claim to provide a complete depiction of the political events of that time; it is only a partial section of the overall action, which naturally cannot always fully account for the thoughts and motives of the political leadership. This procedure will also have to be adhered to in the later publications of the Reichsarchiv.</body>\n",

      "<body>On none of the theaters of war, neither in the West nor in the East, had a decision been made during the summer and autumn campaigns of 1914. The initial war plans of both the Central Powers and their opponents had failed. On all fronts, a balance of forces had been reached, and operations had come to a standstill. Although the German armies had succeeded in freeing German soil from the enemy, except for small areas in southern Alsace and East Prussia, carrying the war far into enemy territory and taking economically valuable lands, this advantage was countered by the increasingly tight blockade ring closing around the Central Powers, posing a very serious threat. Although Turkey had entered the war on the side of the Central Powers, the question of establishing secure connections with the new ally still awaited resolution; Serbia had not yet been overthrown, Bulgaria had not been won over to the Central Powers, and Romania was not inclined to allow munitions transports destined for Turkey to pass through.\n",
      "In view of this situation, the behavior of the neutrals could become of decisive importance. The German General assigned to the Sultan of the Ottomans, Field Marshal Baron von der Goltz, had already emphasized in a letter dated December 14, 1914, to the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army that the decision would now \"largely rest with the small Balkan powers.\" They could tip the balance to one side or the other with the deployment of their not insignificant forces. This was clearly recognized not only by the statesmen of the Central Powers but also by the Entente. Thus, the courting of the Balkan states by all warring powers was understandable. A success for the Entente threatened the collapse of Austria-Hungary. The decisions of the Balkan powers were influenced not only by the military situation but also by Italy's increasingly dubious stance. This country was increasingly pressing its claims for significant territorial expansion against Austria-Hungary.</body>\n",

      "Meanwhile, on January 1, 1915, the meeting took place in Berlin, initially attended only by the two chiefs of staff of the allied armies with their closest associates. General v. Falkenhayn noted at the outset that it was impossible to further weaken the Western Front in favor of the East, as there was a double superiority there. The new formations would not be ready for use until February, and he planned to deploy them in the West. Subsequently, a lively discussion ensued between the two chiefs of staff about the future focus of warfare, without achieving a reconciliation of the existing differences. During a break around noon, General v. Falkenhayn had a brief conversation with the Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief East, General Ludendorff, who was also summoned to Berlin. Here, on behalf of Field Marshal v. Hindenburg, he advocated for a decisive war effort in the East, specifically through an offensive from the East Prussian front, and requested the deployment not only of the new formations but also of all forces in the West that could be spared. General v. Falkenhayn replied that it was out of the question to transfer any forces from the Western Front to the East. The conversation between the two chiefs of staff continued in the presence of General Ludendorff. General v. Conrad brought up the question of the deployment of the German new formations, whether in the West or East. General v. Falkenhayn now stated that he could not yet commit to this question; it would only be ripe for decision in about three weeks. Depending on the demands of the situation at that time, the new formations would be deployed \"in either direction\" as needed. Regarding the course of the discussion, General Ludendorff stated in a letter to the Reichsarchiv dated June 12, 1930, that during the discussion, General v. Falkenhayn could not make a decision on the deployment of reinforcements in the West or East. Particularly unempathetic, I received no clear answer, and even later, Falkenhayn handled everything dilatorily in Conrad's presence. The whole thing was unpleasant and meaningless. It was a struggle against preconceived opinions. If Conrad misunderstood Falkenhayn, it is possible, as clarity was lacking.”</body>\n",

We would then lose all freedom of action and be at the mercy of others.\"\n",
      "The next day, on January 4, General v. Conrad received a report from the Austro-Hungarian military attaché in Rome, indicating that Italy was making all preparations to enter the war against Austria-Hungary and Germany; Italy's military readiness would reach its peak at the end of March; however, the army was already ready by the end of January. Almost simultaneously, General v. Conrad also received a telegram from the Austro-Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Berchtold, confirming the attaché's information and pointing out the great importance that military successes might have in this situation. These serious reports about Italy's stance were what led General v. Conrad to decide to launch a major offensive from the lower Carpathians. After a detailed explanation of the circumstances, he requested on January 6 from the German supreme army command and the commander-in-chief of the East the transport of four to five divisions to the Carpathians. General v. Falkenhayn, however, was initially unable to agree with General v. Conrad's view. When the inquiry, which he also directed to Teschen on the same day, again highlighted the great contrast between the two general staffs in their views on overall warfare. \"Romania's stance,\" General v. Falkenhayn telegraphed — \"Defeating Bulgaria and the extremely important establishment of a connection with Turkey is exclusively dependent on the situation in Serbia. Would it not be advisable, therefore, if one were to decide to divert forces from the 9th Army, to deploy them against Serbia rather than in the Carpathians?\" But this inquiry also contained another significant hint: According to German diplomacy, Italy could only be kept calm by quickly satisfying its demands by pushing back the Russians from the Carpathians to Galicia...\"</body>\n",

      "<body>v. Falkenhayn once again gave cause for security measures. As early as January 2, he requested reports from the army high commands of the West on what orders had been made or were intended for the construction of rear positions. The result did not seem satisfactory to him. On January 7, he therefore issued an order to the armies of the Western Army, emphasizing that the goal, \"to fortify the positions so that they can be held for a long time, even by small minorities, against attacks by superior forces,\" had only been achieved at a few points. \"Only if this succeeds will it be possible to grant real rest to the withdrawn parts, and on the other hand, to provide strong parts for special use in army command, which is absolutely necessary for obvious reasons.\" He was still primarily concerned with holding the front line and expanding the positions facing the enemy. In addition, he demanded \"installations that ensure interception of the enemy if he should succeed at one point or another in taking over the first line of defense.\"</body>\n",
      "<body>General v. Falkenhayn supplemented these orders with a directive¹) on January 25 to all army high commands of the Western Front, in which he demanded that the troops stubbornly defend the front line in the event of an enemy attack. \"Even the slightest success\" should be immediately wrested back from the enemy. Nevertheless, it must be expected that the enemy will succeed in breaking through in places. Therefore, rear positions should be expanded. \"Under no circumstances is it intended to occupy the expanded rear position to a large extent, but only at the purely local point where a breakthrough by the enemy succeeded.

By December 20, they had stalled; their aftereffects smoldered for weeks; focal points remained the area of Neuve Chapelle, La Bassée, Carency, and Ecurie. The 6th Army Command had instructed the XIV Army Corps on January 1 to initially gain enough ground at the Loretto Chapel to establish a stronghold and make enemy artillery observation on the heights impossible. Then, the VII and XIV Army Corps were to jointly conduct an attack against Givenchy les la Bassée–Cuinchy on both sides of the La Bassée Canal. On the Loretto Heights, the efforts of the Baden regiments had to be initially limited to a rather changeable and costly artillery and hand grenade battle due to a lack of sufficient offensive means. This led to no visible successes by early February, similar to the advances by parts of the VII and XIV Army Corps west of La Bassée on January 25.\n",

Conrad: It was the task of the German Eastern Army \"to push the Russians back to the Vistula or into their bridgeheads, and otherwise to clear up the Russian parts opposite West Prussia and in East Prussia as quickly as possible, then to limit itself to a more delaying warfare.\" At the same time, he expressed his opinion that a similar task as that of the German Eastern Army must fall to the Austro-Hungarian military leadership \"in Galicia and Serbia, with whose solution they would have enough to do for the winter months.\"\n",
      "In stark contrast to this was the position that the Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff continued to hold. He considered the current deployment of allied forces on the eastern theater of war insufficient to achieve any greater success at any point. In particular, he considered any attempt to drive the Russians out of Galicia with the available forces to be hopeless. The only effective preventive measure against the intervention of neutral powers, expected with certainty by early March at the latest, he saw in the \"quickest deployment of new German forces from the west or newly formed ones\" in the east. With their help, he considered a \"decisive success\" on the eastern theater of war achievable. He suggested their deployment \"in the gap between Pilica and Nida, especially the northern wing of the 2nd Army Woyrsch, to break through the gap in the Russian front towards Radom and force the Russians to retreat behind the Vistula-San line.\"</body>\n",

      "In his response received on the evening of January 9, General v. Conrad outlined the tasks of the Southern Army as follows: \"In connection with the main attack of the Austrian 3rd Army against the area Sanok—Lisko—Stary-Sambor, the Southern Army will advance as an encircling group from the area northeast of Munkacz and north of Huszt, using the main lines over Bereczke—Lucholka, over Bolovec—Tuchla, and over Toronya—Wyszkow. After reaching the area Dolina—Stryj—Synnówka, the further task of the Southern Army will depend on the outcome of the battles of the 3rd Army in the area south of Przemyśl on one hand and the intervention of Russian reinforcements on the other. Depending on the situation, the Southern Army will either engage comprehensively and decisively in the battle of the 3rd Army over Drohobycz—Boryslaw or, if the 3rd Army has already reached the area Sambor—Przemyśl by then, advance against the flank and rear of the enemy over Schydaczow—Zurawno—Martiniow. However, if strong Russian forces are brought into the area Stanislau—Nadworna—Kolomea, the further task of the Southern Army could also be to attack these enemy forces, for which the army group advancing with the left wing over Körösmezö under General of Cavalry v. Pflanzer would be subordinated to it. Depending on these tasks, which can only be assessed during the course of operations, A. O. K. will also regulate the command relationships according to the situation and arrange for the consolidation of higher formations for joint tasks.\"\n",
      "General v. Falkenhayn had serious reservations about the intentions laid down here, which he expressed in a telegram to General Conrad on January 10: According to all the information available to him, the Carpathian Mountains east of the Uzsoker Pass are impassable for German artillery and supply vehicles at this time of year. He was also not aware that the agreements made by the Austro-Hungarian military leadership with the Commander-in-Chief East envisaged an operation over Stryj, rather he assumed that the deployment of the Southern Army was intended at and west of the Uzsoker Pass.</body>\n",

Due to the events on the left wing of the Pflanzer Army Group, the defense of the Uzsok Pass had been assigned to it; to support this front, the only available reserves, the 56th Landsturm and 8th Cavalry Division, were marched there. Fortunately, the Russians did not exploit their success here. General v. Boroevic postponed the recapture of the important pass in agreement with the military leadership until the time of the joint attack of the entire Carpathian Front. He received the instructions for this operation on January 8, simultaneously with the notification that his army was to be reinforced by five divisions: from the 1st Army north of the Vistula, the V Corps (33rd and 37th Infantry Division) was assigned to him, from the 5th Army from the Balkan Front the XIX Corps (7th, 29th Infantry Division) and the 40th Infantry Division were supplied. On the previous right wing and in the middle of this army front, some position improvements were made in preparation for their own offensive, leading to the occupation of the area at Kalnica, Komancza, and Hafel. Also on the inner wing of the front, in the section of the Pflanzer Army between the road saddle 604, northwest (Glabizow and Konieczna) the Cavalry Corps Bortv) secured, relatively small battles were fought, Russian attacks, which were undertaken against the southern wing of the 4th Army, aimed to bring the important communication line Gorlice—Neu-Sandez, which was threatened, to a halt.\n",

For the newly deployed German units, there was the added challenge that they lacked important prerequisites for a winter campaign in the mountains: the troops were not accustomed to staying in the mountains and the increased physical exertion associated with it, and despite all efforts to procure winter clothing and equipment, the deployment of German troops in the mountains was largely an undertaking without sufficient preparation.\n",
      "The extraordinarily unfavorable weather this year brought further difficulties. Very soon after the start of the offensive, extensive snowfall with strong winds set in after clear, calm frost weather, often escalating into massive snowstorms. Snow flurries and then dense fog again left the artillery with only temporary effectiveness. Only loaded on hand sleds and pack animals, mountain artillery was able to follow the troops off the passable road, while mobile artillery became irretrievably stuck in the deep snow as soon as it left the solid roads; even individual pedestrians fared the same. Thus, the main burden of the battle rested solely on the infantry. The demands placed on them by the terrain were unheard of: almost every path had to be shoveled and trodden first; often the infantrymen sank up to their chests in snowdrifts and had to work their way out again with all their strength. Bitter wind whipped the frostbitten face, covered it with painful ice crust, and left the body steaming from exertion frozen. Constantly, the troops had to step in for the failing draft animals to move the sleds loaded with machine guns, mountain guns, ammunition, and baggage forward. When the troops engaged in combat, the stiff-frozen hands had to be thawed before handling the weapons, and when battle and march were over, accommodation and necessary care, often even warm meals, were lacking. Often, the troops had to spend nights in a row in the open at 15 to 20° cold. The number of sick grew to a threatening level, and the physical and mental resilience of the troops was put to a severe test. This harsh mountain deployment lasted well into April, and when thaw and rain set in, floods and the swampy conditions of the valleys and roads impaired the combat and marching capability of the troops.</body>\n",

      "<body>With the regiment of the 1st Infantry Division reinforced, fierce battles erupted in the area of Sjenowoya. Now the right wing group — Corps Gerok — could also advance: General v. Gerok, having detached strong reserves, had the Austro-Hungarian 19th Infantry Division encircle eastwards against the pass road Repneye—Toronya, the 48th Reserve Division with the main force under Lieutenant General v. Hahn against Repneye, and a small side column under Major General Stehr over Csufka. Serious fighting did not occur on January 24. The 19th Infantry Division approached, without encountering the enemy, to within 2 km of the pass road south of Felszöbes, thus standing deep in the rear of the Russians still holding before the 48th Reserve Division; from this, Group Hahn prepared to attack the strong Russian positions north of Divimez, while Group Stehr, delayed by extraordinary terrain difficulties, only came within 3 km of the enemy positions south of Csufka.\n",
      "On January 25, the Austro-Hungarian 19th Division did not succeed in reaching the pass road, nor could the center and left wing drive the Russians from their positions south of Repneye. On the left army wing, the enemy also yielded under the pressure of the western encirclement and withdrew to the heights south and east of Bezierszallas.\n",
      "Despite the previously small territorial gains, the prospects for the Southern Army did not seem unfavorable. The extreme right army wing was already southeast of Toronya in the enemy's rear, only on the left army wing had it managed to escape the encirclement from the west. Moreover, since the right wing of the 3rd Army had seized the Uzsoker Pass, General v. Linsingen believed, based on the enemy's previous behavior and the received reports, that the Russians would not withstand a powerful attack, but were fighting for time and seeking to delay the army's advance. The army order for January 26 therefore emphasized that each corps had to open its own advance route through energetic action, regardless of the neighbors. The intervention of the 3rd Guard Infantry Division from the west was not expected for the next day, as it was only expected to reach the area south of Uzsok at that time.\n",
      "But even on January 26, the Austro-Hungarian 19th Infantry Division did not succeed in reaching the pass road near Toronya.

In pursuit of the retreating enemy, the Austro-Hungarian 19th Infantry Division reached the Galician border by evening with the main forces, about halfway to Wyszkow, and advanced with a right flank column up to the Beskid Pass; the 48th Reserve Division gathered in the area of Felsövereze-Majdanka. B^1) of the Hofmann Corps, the enemy still offered stubborn resistance; it was only in the evening, after heavy fighting in the deep snow-covered, pathless forest terrain, that the fiercely contested steep high positions at Bezerzallas were wrested from the enemy, with regiments of the 1st Infantry Division involved on the flanks. As the reports arriving in Munkacs on the evening of January 27 from the right wing of the army were very favorable, the 19th Infantry Division, in pursuit of a severely beaten enemy, was already assumed to have taken possession of the area resistance at the Beskid Pass and near Wyszkow, General v. Liningen ordered the dispatch of a mixed brigade in the direction of Wolfsjanka for the next day, to also assist the left wing of the army in advancing.\n",
      "However, the course of January 28 showed that the high command's hopes for rapid progress were premature. Attempts to relocate the Russians' retreat route to Dolina by encircling them via Beskid Pass-Leopoldsdorf failed due to insurmountable terrain and weather difficulties. The Austro-Hungarian 19th Infantry Division was stuck in front of the Beskid Pass and Saddle 941 south of Wyszkow, the 48th Reserve Division advanced into the Toronya-Repenye area and thus was out of action for the day's battle; the brigade Stehr^1) deployed by it towards Wolfsjanka only reached the area southeast of this place; it thus effectively became part of the Hofmann Corps but remained subordinate to the 48th Reserve Division. For the Austro-Hungarian 10th Cavalry Division arriving that day, no use was yet in sight, and it was initially placed as an army reserve in the Kiralyhaza-Beregisza area. In front of the left wing of the army, the Russians vacated their position, allowing the Hofmann Corps to take possession of Bolovec, Felsövereze, and Al. Berecke. The 3rd Guard Infantry Division had arrived in the area around Uszok and was to reach Libochora from there the next day.</body>\n",

      "Through these successes achieved under extraordinary efforts, the possibility seemed finally within reach to force an exit from the mountains, at least with the left wing of the army. General von Linsingen was determined to exploit the situation with all means. However, the fighting strength of his army had sunk so much under the impact of the heavy fighting and the weather that the final success seemed doubtful without new reinforcements. Significant reserves were no longer available: the artillery and the machine gun unit, as well as the assigned infantry battalion of the German 5th Cavalry Division, had already been set in motion to the 3rd Guard Infantry Division, cavalry not usable in the mountainous terrain. Since the offensive of the Pflanzer army group, which began only on January 31, had not yet had an effect, General von Linsingen requested the Austro-Hungarian military command to assign him further forces on both army wings, the Austro-Hungarian 6th Infantry Division of the Pflanzer army group, as well as parts of the 3rd Army. However, to give the enemy no time for new resistance and to bring up further reinforcements, the continuation of the attack was ordered for the next day, with Brigade Stehr subordinated to the Hofmann group for this purpose.\n",

Across the entire army front, the enemy responded to new encirclement attempts by extending their lines, repeatedly repelling the flanking columns. Thus, only the Hofmann group could come closer to Slawków. The right wing remained south of Wyszkow, the 1st Infantry Division lying before the elevated positions of Ostrog and Zwinin. The 3rd Guard Infantry Division reached Zawadka without a fight, and beyond that, the advanced units already encountered the enemy 3 km northwest of Zawadka.\n",
      "The request by General von Linsingen for reinforcements was rejected on February 5 by the Austro-Hungarian military command.

The Western Group (6th Infantry Division) advanced with the main forces over the Pantyr Pass towards Zielona on January 30; a left side column had already reached Osmaloda on January 28. The spatially distant Eastern Group (36th Infantry Division and Border Guard Units) advanced with the main forces over Izwor-Brezaz northwards on January 31, with a right side column towards Rimpolung. On February 1, the Central Group (42nd Infantry Division) finally caught up; it advanced with the main forces over the Tartar Pass towards Worochtza and reached Zabie with a right side column on the same day. Only in the Pruth Valley did enemy rearguards offer stronger resistance. By February 5, the western column of the 6th Infantry Division was at Porohy and west of it in the Lomnica Valley, with the main forces still held up before Zielona. The 42nd Division was close to Tatarow, its right column in the Bornarsch from Zabie eastwards towards Uście Putilla. The Eastern Group had reached Schipoth with the parts that had advanced northwards and had come halfway to Rimpolung-Fundul Moldova with the eastern column.

Fortunately, the Russians, following the railway line south, proceeded only very hesitantly and cautiously here. Since the 4th Army, in a report on February 5, pointed to the extraordinary difficulties of the planned attack and declared itself unable to begin it before February 9, General v. Conrad decided to abandon this operation and to march the XVII Corps (11th and 45th Divisions) designated for this purpose to the 3rd Army. He intended to deploy it in the gap secured only by the 4th Cavalry Division and a Landsturm Brigade between the III and VII Corps over Felsővízköz to attack the Dufla Pass. The VII Corps was to join the advance, the III to cover the left flank. General v. Conrad hoped to begin the new attack on February 9 or 10. The VIII Corps, rolling in from the Serbian theater of war, was designated after some negotiations for deployment west of the Szurmay group to also create space at the Uzsok Pass. Given the decisive importance General v. Conrad attached to the operation of the 3rd Army's eastern wing, he decided to detach it from the rest of the army and form a new 2nd Army from it, under the General of Cavalry v. Boehm-Ermolli2).\n",
      "Meanwhile, the situation at the front of the 3rd Army, especially at the Dufla Pass, had become increasingly threatening, and General v. Boroevic had just been prompted, contrary to the intentions of the army command, to move a division of the VIII Corps (21st) there, when on February 7 a new heavy blow struck his army: Aufvo was lost, and the Russians thus gained possession of the double-track railway south to Mezőlaborcz. Also southwest of this, new terrain had to be abandoned. The impact of this mishap on the commander-in-chief of the 3rd Army was so strong that he wanted to completely abandon the offensive and only clear the area around Mezőlaborcz of the enemy. General v. Conrad, however, remained firm. The 3rd Army was informed on February 8 that further dismantling was out of the question; the VIII Corps would only be made available to it with the restriction that its 9th Infantry Division would have to be assembled in the Tácsány—Szontos area. At the same time, the deployment of the 2nd Army command was ordered.\n",

Conrad noted that the goal of bringing about a significant turnaround there \"seemed temporarily unattainable, although it was still hoped for later, relying on the capabilities of the Austro-Hungarian army.\" However, General v. Conrad viewed the situation more favorably at this point.

In a telegram to General v. Falkenhayn on February 11, it stated: \"We are continuously transporting all forces that can be spared elsewhere to the Carpathians.\" At the same time, he urgently requested consideration of whether a German division could be freed up somewhere and quickly brought to the Southern Army.

Thus, on February 15, only the VII Corps launched an attack. However, it did not lead to a decision on that day. The operations on the rest of the army front had also not taken the hoped-for course. In the center, with the V, XVIII, and XIX Corps, there were even new setbacks and considerable territorial losses. Against the V Corps, still standing north of the San, the Russians had advanced comprehensively on both sides and forced it to abandon the northern bank. The situation here became so threatening that General v. Boroevic saw himself forced on February 13 to deploy the 9th Infantry Division of the VIII Corps, originally intended to support the front of the XIX Corps, at the V Corps. Earlier attempts on the right army wing, with the Szurmay Group, to wrest the area around Borynia from the Russians had also failed.

On February 21, the XIII Corps, whose leader was ill, joined these formations. Everything seemed to be developing most favorably: with the almost certain capture of Dolina, the retreat lines of the Russian forces positioned before the center and right wing of the Southern Army were breached. On February 21, strong enemy forces advanced from three sides to counterattack Stanislau. Forces had to be withdrawn from the group facing Czeczawa and from the eastern group at Horodentka, and the first parts of the 5th Infantry Division arriving in Delatyn had to be brought in; only with the help of these reinforcements could Stanislau initially be held.\n",

Under these conditions, the 3rd Army also assured vigorous support. General v. Boehm-Ermolli believed that, considering the Przemysl fortress, he could no longer resist.

The course of the first days already indicated that the attack would fail. Neither the left wing of the 2nd Army against Lupkow nor the right wing of the 3rd Army set against Bidran could make significant progress. The attack starting on February 28 by the center of the 3rd Army and the group Schmidt (27th, 32nd, 43rd Division) advancing against Baligrod of the 2nd Army had only minor success. On the other hand, the XVIII Corps attacking towards Tworylne on the San could wrest some positions from the enemy, visibly then the V Corps in the Chmiel area began bridging the San. To continue the attack with the main focus on Baligrod, General v. Boehm-Ermolli made the 13th and 31st Division available to the Terstánszky Group.\n",

Conrad on March 3 to urgently call on all armies to expel the enemy from West and Central Galicia and thereby bring about the relief of Przemysl. \"This relief,\" as stated in the telegram to the armies, \"must be carried out with regard to the fortress's supplies by mid-March at the latest and is of utmost importance for the overall situation. The main thrust towards the besieged fortress is to be led by the 2nd Army. Of the remaining armies, the 3rd should join this attack with its right wing, the 4th should gather as strong forces as possible on its right wing and advance towards Zmigrod. The Southern Army should try to remove the enemy from its front itself, and as soon as it attempted to withdraw forces, also proceed to attack. The Southern Army should reach the Dolina area as quickly as possible.\"</body>\n",

      "However, reality fell significantly short of these wishes of the Austro-Hungarian military leadership. Despite all efforts, the 2nd Army did not make significant progress in the following days. When a new attack attempt on the right wing of the 3rd Army failed with heavy losses on March 5, General v. Boroevic felt compelled to order the cessation of his army's offensive. However, the Austro-Hungarian military leadership ordered on the evening of March 6, based on the advances of the 2nd Army, that the offensive should continue by all means, and the 3rd Army was to attack not only with its right wing but also to bind the enemy to unyielding attacks along the entire remaining front. On March 10, the offensive reached its peak. On the right wing of the 2nd Army, the Russians had been pushed back over the San, and the attack spearhead Terjstianitz had been able to gain ground on Baligrod and Lupkow, but they were still about 50 km away from the outer forts of the fortress Przemysl. However, the enemy seemed to be preparing a large-scale counterattack. Already on March 11, this began east of Lupkow and threw the left wing of the 2nd Army back to its starting position. Nevertheless, the attack on the rest of the army front continued — the fate of Przemysl depended on it! But it still could not break through. All further plans were ended by a new Russian counterattack on March 13. The left army wing was breached; the own attack thus failed, and now everything depended on supporting the front. The 3rd Army helped by extending its section to the area of Lupkow. On March 14, General v. Boehm-Ermolli was forced to order the cessation of the attack.\n",
      "The 4th Army was also supposed to participate in the general attack. On March 7, Field Marshal Lieutenant v. Arz advanced with three and a half divisions (12th, 1/226th, 8th, 10th) against Gorlice, with two divisions (39th, 15th) against Staszkowka.

On March 10, the 1st Infantry Division managed to establish a firm foothold on the saddle between the two heights of Swinin. To expand this success, General v. Linsingen intended to deploy the 4th Infantry Division here. However, Field Marshal Lieutenant Hofmann reported that due to the general exhaustion of his troops, he could not spare the entire division, so only one brigade was sent. This was not sufficient to bring about a decisive change. On March 13, the Russians launched strong counterattacks, which were generally repelled.\n",
      "On the same day, General v. Linsingen received an inquiry from the German Chief of Staff about whether there was still a prospect of breaking through the mountains in March, which he affirmed, provided that the attack on the entire Carpathian front continued and milder weather ensued. However, on March 17, the directive from the Austro-Hungarian High Command arrived, stating that the attack should essentially only be continued by the Southern Army and the Pflanzer Army until reinforcements arrived. General v. Linsingen therefore presented his assessment of the overall situation on the Carpathian front to the German Emperor in an immediate report on March 18: Based on previous experiences, a frontal breakthrough through the mountains offered no prospect of success, but an attack conducted with strong forces north of the Carpathians did. He believed that the success of this operation could be secured if a strong army under German leadership was assembled here. For this, the three German divisions of the Southern Army, which were to remain defensive, would have to be detached and, due to unfavorable railway conditions, marched on foot to the left flank of the Pflanzer Army. Their reinforcement by another German division and an Austro-Hungarian corps would be desirable. The deployment would take two to three weeks.\n",

I cannot make reliable predictions regarding further developments of the events, naturally, both in view of the difficulties still to be overcome in the attack and the condition of the fortress garrison holding out under the greatest deprivations. However, nothing is left untried to break through with the attack and, in conjunction with mobile forces, to relieve the fortress.\"\n",

Should — which I cannot judge — the German Supreme Army Command have ready-to-use forces, possibly two to three divisions, which could be quickly brought into the area of the 2nd Army by rail, I would ask Your Excellency to consider whether it would not be possible and appropriate to immediately set these forces in motion to support the relief of Przemysl, which is of great importance as the foundation of our joint position, and to temporarily make them available to the Imperial and Royal Army Command, but also for the case that relief of Przemysl is no longer possible in time, to definitely consider continuing the offensive from the Carpathians and from Eastern Galicia, and for this too, any increase in strength would be very desirable, which would either directly or via the Army Group Pflanzer be provided to the Southern Army, whose reinforcement in this case is also intended from here.\"</body>\n",

      "<body>The release of the Russian siege army, however, brought the danger of increased force deployment at the battlefront alarmingly close. General v. Conrad had been determined to continue the offensive, even if the fortress could no longer be relieved. In this sense, he had already issued instructions for future operations on March 17: After the completion of the reinforcement units, the attack on the entire Carpathian front was to be resumed. \"...This attack, however,\" it continued, \"is no longer under the pressure of time, which had previously been dictated by the unsuccessful relief of Przemysl, and is therefore to be conducted with tenacity and in a systematic manner.\" However, it was initially limited to the eastern wing of the army front: the task of the Pflanzer army group, which was to be reinforced as much as possible, was to open the way through the mountains for the neighboring armies from the east. For the time being, however, they were only to continue attacking with strong offensive spirit, securing against the east and holding Czernowitz, and to behave defensively on the western wing. The southern army was to continue the attack, the 2nd to involve its right wing, to strengthen its positions on the left; the 3rd army was to prepare its eastern wing for the resumption of the offensive, otherwise it, like the 4th army, was to connect enemy troop movements. In addition, two infantry divisions, two infantry brigades, and a cavalry division were to be held in reserve behind the front by the 2nd and 3rd armies. General v. Conrad sought to adhere to these intentions even now after the fall of Przemysl.\n",
      "Meanwhile, on the night of March 20, a massive Russian attack broke out against the 3rd army from the direction of the Dukla Pass. In four days of bitter fighting, the front was pushed in up to 6 km deep on the right wing. The reserves designated for the Pflanzer army group had to be held back, and the 2nd army was instructed to support General v. Bojevovic. But this army too had already become the target of Russian attacks; in fierce battles, the Russians succeeded in significantly pushing back the front. There was no longer any doubt that the enemy had launched a decisive offensive. It was no longer about continuing the own attack, but only about holding the already wavering front. Once again, the 4th army had to hold out and give another division (26th) to the 3rd army. The Russian attacks continued unabated; on March 23, the attack group of the 2nd army had to return to its starting positions before the beginning of the offensive.</body>\n",

      "When the Russians began to advance again from the east against Bukovina in mid-March, probably also for political reasons, to persuade Romania to join the Entente, General v. Pflanzer was forced to strengthen the forces stationed here. On March 23, the Marschall Group (German 5th and Austro-Hungarian 10th Cavalry Division) was moved to the northeast, followed by additional forces, the 8th Cavalry and 42nd Infantry Division. On March 26, General v. Pflanzer transferred command of the front from Czernowitz to the Dniester to General Freiherr Marschall; under his command now were: Group Ljubicic (combined 30th Division) in front of Zaleszczyki; 42nd Division (84th and 83rd Brigade), 19th Cavalry Brigade (former 5th Cavalry Division), 6th, 8th, and 10th as well as German 5th Cavalry Division. On the western front of the army group, the situation remained relatively unchanged. There were no major battles until mid-April. Russian advances from the east over the national border and from the north over the Dniester could be repelled, although own attempts to capture the bridgehead of Zaleszczyki failed. By mid-April, the army group generally held the national border between Pruth and Dniester, then the southern bank of this river to Niezviska. From here, the front ran in a southwesterly direction over Ottynia to Porohy. Parts blocked the upper Lomnica Valley.</body>\n",

Then the left wing of the Southern Army extended to the area south of Uzszyki grn. To ensure possession of the Uszok Pass, General v. Linsingen ordered the Szurmay Group once again to hold their current positions at all costs and further reduced their sector by placing the right wing division, the Austro-Hungarian 38th Infantry Division, under the Bothmer Corps, which then extended to the Hnyla-Bach.

On April 8, they succeeded in pushing the center of the Szurmay Group south to the pass entrance.\n",

Linsingen hoped to exploit the success and ordered General Count Bothmer to \"immediately provide strong reserves for an offensive in a northwesterly direction\" that same evening. However, the attempt to expand the success towards Stole failed the next day, as the Russians had immediately entrenched themselves behind the lost positions in new strong positions.

On April 6, the Russians appeared with strong forces also in front of the left wing of the Southern Army, before the Szurmay Group. Their inner wing had to be withdrawn to the Ceremcha¹, and there were also minor breaches in the middle of the 2nd Army. The 3rd Army could not assist, but the 4th Army again provided a division². This left it stripped of forces to the limit of possibility. Significant battles had not taken place on their front. The Russians did not exploit their favorable position in West Galicia in the future either and focused all efforts on gaining the Ung Valley at the junction between the 2nd and Southern Army. On the advice of the Southern Army's high command, stronger forces of the 2nd Army had been assembled behind the inner wing. On April 7 and 8, heavy attacks began here, through which the Kiczera was suddenly wrested from the middle of the Szurmay Group. Three days later, the Russians also managed to gain a foothold on the important Ceremcha, the apex of the front. Only after the intervention of reserves from the 2nd Army (65th Brigade, 33rd Division) could the enemy be driven back here in two days of fighting. To ensure unified leadership in this important front section, the Ceremcha was incorporated into the command area of the 2nd Army.\n",

He was provided with the German 35th Reserve Division, but without the battalions and heavy artillery. The section was divided between the Landwehr Corps and the Kövess group. The previously still held idea of an offensive by the Landwehr Corps had to be finally abandoned.\n",

Since the army, according to the Commander-in-Chief (General Sievers), does not possess sufficient flexibility and means for maneuvering, he sees the only way of active engagement in a slow advance supported by the work of sappers. In the direction of Mlawa, the troops of the fortified area of the fortress Nowogeorgiewsk (four infantry divisions) are in relatively successful combat with comparatively weak German forces (two divisions). It appears that the enemy can be pushed back here through vigorous pressure on his territory.\n",

Against these armies, about 25 German divisions are operating, which have worn down their forces so much in continuous attacks that, if the German High Command does not succeed in bringing reinforcements from the west, we can expect that the 1st, 2nd, and 5th Armies will be able to maintain their current position for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "In the south from the Pilica to the overflow of the Vistula, the enemy facing our 4th and 9th Armies (17½ infantry divisions) (17 divisions) apparently does not have the opportunity for a broad offensive, but relies on strong rearward positions established in time (Czestochowa—Krakow) and has also strongly fortified its current position. The 4th Army secures the left flank of the northwest front by its deployment and simultaneously covers the shortest roads to Ivangorod; the position of the 4th Army, advanced compared to the general front of the northwest armies, also offers it a favorable starting position for transitioning to the offensive, but its forces are not sufficient for this (8½ infantry divisions), moreover, the opposing enemy has made use of the defensive line of the Pilica and fortified it strongly.</body>\n",

      "In total, the armies listed above have 99 infantry divisions, opposed by about 83 divisions (41 German and 42 Austrian). Additionally, two army corps, the Guard Corps and the IV Siberian (4½1) Infantry Divisions, are available behind the front to the supreme commander and can be moved as reinforcements to any section of the northern half of our front at any time.\n",

The army's manpower shortage was about half a million, and the artillery lacked more than 200,000 rounds. \"A partial satisfaction of the most essential needs could only be expected in the course of the second half of February; however, a noticeable improvement in this regard only in April.\" Thus, one was initially forced to adopt a waiting stance.\n",
      "Nevertheless, General Danilow had already set the goals for future operations in his memorandum, \"in case, of course, the enemy gave us time to organize our armies.\" There was every reason to indulge in \"a certain optimism in this regard: the Austrian armies were defeated; as for the Germans, we had to determine the character of their future operations depending on the events in the West (where our allies had gone on the offensive (Somme and the first Bornachst in Champagne), which led us to assume that this offensive would be carried out with increasing energy and determination.\"</body>\n",

The way to Vienna is shorter, and one would only have to deal with the Austrians weakened by previous defeats. The offensive on Vienna would also incline Romania and Italy to side with Russia, which could then \"even cause the complete internal collapse of the entire Austro-Hungarian monarchy.\" On the other hand, the advance on Vienna (Budapest) would only strike the \"second-rate opponent\" and appears \"from the standpoint of common alliance interests, which require a concentric blow against our main opponent, the Germans, disadvantageous.\"\n",
      "In this regard – as General Danilow explained after the war – the conditions had fundamentally changed since the beginning of the war. At that time, the army of the Danube monarchy had been the strongest opponent for Russia. In January 1915, however, it could no longer be assumed that it was still capable of independent offensive. The Germans, however, had meanwhile brought their forces on the Eastern Front from five to fifteen army corps (not counting the individual brigades and divisions) and had since then, \"in terms of their strength, stood first among all our opponents.\" If one pushed with full force initially into Austria-Hungary, one would no longer have been able to simultaneously fend off a major German attack, which was still considered quite possible despite the battles in the West. Therefore, the advance on Vienna was only considered if the Danube monarchy could be dealt a \"deadly blow in a short time.\" However, this was very uncertain. Finally, even the successful execution of this operation would not have meant the end of the war for a long time.\n",
      "In his memorandum, General Danilow concluded that only one possibility remained: a decisive blow against the Germans. However, this appeared difficult, as the German border areas had an extremely well-developed railway network. The opponent thus had the possibility of rapid troop movements, through which he could halt the Russian attack at any time or strike from the flank.</body>\n",

Such a decision could have put us in an extremely dangerous position.\" But otherwise, the conquest of East Prussia was of great importance: \"The war will be carried into Germany, the inevitable flight of the population must cause unrest throughout the German Reich, while the conquest of one of the most important territories of the Prussian crown would have meant compensation for the loss of part of our Vistula territory to the Germans.\" Finally, the area of East Prussia was the only section of the entire northwest front where actual successes could still be hoped for.\n",
      "For all these reasons, General Danilow was in favor of attacking Germany, specifically East Prussia, as soon as circumstances allowed. All available reserves — the Guard Corps, the IV Siberian Corps just arrived from the Far East, and the reconstituted XV Corps — were to be used. The Grand Duke and the Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest Front agreed.

General Ivanov, however, did not want to encircle the enemy's entire front from the east anymore, but — according to his earlier plan — to break through the Carpathians south of Przemysl, taking advantage of the current increase in strength. This was a completely different operation than what the Supreme Army Command intended; however, it accepted General Ivanov's decision, as it increasingly became dependent on the army group commanders equipped with great powers. Apart from the combat situation at the front, the difficulties in this case may have contributed to the inability to reinforce the extreme left army wings in Eastern Galicia in time, as the task originally assigned to them would have required.\n",

      "<body>Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann appeared confident based on previous experiences. How the operation would develop further, he could not predict to the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army. However, he believed that even with a devastating defeat of the Russians, the German Eastern Army would probably not be strong enough to carry the operation against the fortress line Grodno—Kowno further; however, it was hoped that it would be possible to cross the Bobr south of Augustów and take the important barrier Osowiec from behind. A prerequisite for the success of the operation would be the successful defense of the southern border of East Prussia.\n",
      "A General Staff officer, whom Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann informed immediately after his discussion with General v. Falkenhayn about its course, noted in his records shortly thereafter that Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann also described it as \"very desirable\" \"if there were the possibility of bringing in about two more corps from the west to advance them right backwards (along the attack front) on Ostrolenka.\" Then \"a decisive success of the planned operation would be guaranteed.\" General v. Falkenhayn did not comment on Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann's statements, nor did he express himself on the intended use of the newly formed corps on this occasion, as he had not during the previous discussion with Field Marshal v. Hindenburg. The Chief of the General Staff sent his own instructions immediately after General v.

This is also supported by a letter from Generaloberst v. Moltke to the Kaiser dated January 17. Generaloberst v. Moltke, who, with the approval of the Field Marshal, had been instructed by the Chief of the General Staff to draft the letters of January 12, subsequently wrote to the Supreme War Lord on January 17 that a prospect of \"decisively defeating the Russians and coming to peace with them only existed if all dispensable forces were also brought in from the west to force the superior enemy mass, which according to previous experiences repels all our attacks, even at the risk of coming into a difficult situation, into the encirclement of our line.\"</footer>\n",

      "Through the intention of deploying the new corps in the east expressed for the first time in this presentation, General v. Conrad was pleasantly surprised. It is not known why General v. Falkenhayn did not simultaneously inform Field Marshal v. Hindenburg of this decision. He was only relieved of his uncertainty by the Emperor's decision on January 20th. The question of the upcoming operation was thus initially decided in the sense of the leaders in the east.\n",
      "In the directive of the Supreme Army Command of January 20th, which made the newly formed 10th Army from four corps available to the Commander-in-Chief East, it was stated: \"Information requested by the 26th, where the deployment is mentioned. He could easily deploy with three corps in the first line, with one corps in the second line in the area of Lötzen—Insterburg within six days from February 3rd. The second line corps or a corps of the 9th Army can also be transported simultaneously to the area of Gumbinnen—Ortelsburg.\" Thus, the question of the direction of attack was also decided; an offensive over Mlawa was no longer under discussion.\n",
      "In his response, the Commander-in-Chief East requested on January 25th the deployment of the 10th Army with three army corps, including the XXI., in the area of Insterburg—Lötzen—Stallupönen, with one corps, the XXXIX. or XXXX., in the area of Ortelsburg. Additionally, the Commander-in-Chief East considered the transport of an army corps from the 9th Army to the southern border of East Prussia; because securing the right flank of the 8th Army advancing along the southern border of East Prussia had to gain more and more importance as the offensive progressed.\n",
      "General v. Falkenhayn agreed with the proposed deployment on the same day and gave the detailed orders for the railway transports. All other measures were left to the Commander-in-Chief East.</body>\n",

      "At the turn of the year, the 9th Army stood with 23½ infantry and six cavalry divisions¹), front facing east, between Pilica and Vistula in combat. The position generally ran along the Rawka and lower Bzura. The right wing was bent back at the Pilica up to and including Inowlodz, the left stretched along the Vistula to Wloclawek. On the north bank of the river, only weaker troops of the Thorn fortress secured the line Wloclawek—Lipno. The long flank of the 9th Army from Wyszogrod to Wloclawek was therefore all the more endangered, as the freezing of the Vistula was to be expected.\n",
      "In front of the 9th Army, the Russians held a position with numerous strongpoints and several rear lines. They were estimated at 38 infantry and seven cavalry divisions, thus being superior to the 9th Army by 14½ infantry and one cavalry division.\n",
      "The Army High Command 9 had formed the two attack groups Scholz and Linsingen²) at the end of December 1914, to advance the stalled attack by combining forces. At this time, there was hope to break the resistance of the enemy at the Rawka and lower Bzura despite its tenacity and to push it back to Warsaw. Given the extraordinary strength of the enemy positions, the persistent adverse weather, and the shortness of the days, this frontal attack operation was bound to cost a lot of time and ammunition. The Commander-in-Chief, Generaloberst v. Mackensen, hoped, after a pause deemed urgently necessary, to soon proceed with the continuation of the attack on Warsaw, provided that the southern flank of the army was protected at the Pilica and the army remained at its previous strength. General v. Falkenhayn, to whom this view was presented in a report by the Chief of Staff of the 9th Army, Major General Grünert, on December 31, agreed not to impose any restrictions on the army regarding time and strength, and to ensure better supply of ammunition in quantity and quality.</body>\n",

      "<body>considerably greater prospects than the attacker. General v. Linsingen therefore suggested holding the gained front with the weakest possible forces and relocating the freed parts \"to a more operationally effective area.\" The Scholz group essentially faced the same conditions. General v. Linsingen's view on the situation at the 9th Army coincided with that of the Supreme Commander East1). As it was now a matter of transferring forces to the allies in the Carpathians2), they were taken from the 9th Army. Thus, the continuation of a decisive offensive by the 9th Army was deliberately abandoned, but it was to prevent the enemy facing it from moving troops to Galicia through attacks. On January 6, 2½ infantry and one cavalry division had to be transferred to the Austro-Hungarian front: General commands of the II Army Corps and the XXIV Reserve Corps, 1st Infantry Division, ½ 3rd Guard Infantry Division3), 48th Reserve and 5th Cavalry Division. A report requested by the Army High Command on the losses of the infantry of all subordinate corps in the days from January 1 to 10 showed a total of over 7000 men. The I Reserve Corps suffered the most in the attack battles at Mogilydi — a total of 2238 —, followed by the Fabeck Corps with 1869 men. This corps suffered the most losses at the bridgehead at Kozlow Biskup, which was therefore abandoned on the order of the Beseler group on the night of January 15 to 16. From January 10, combat activity was generally limited to the sections at Rawa and Bolimow—Borzymow. The assault of the 4th Infantry Division on the Russian position south of Borzymow on January 16 failed with considerable losses. The main reason for this failure was seen in the too narrow attack front, which allowed the enemy to flank the attack from both sides. In view of the other unsuccessful individual operations, the Supreme Commander East requested on January 19 that the Army High Command \"not leave the course of operations too much to the agreements between the army corps, but rather regulate it more through orders and, if necessary, through personal intervention\"4).</body>\n",

Operationally, the vigorous German advance at the Rawka and the binding of strong Russian reserves at the attack front achieved a gain that had to benefit the upcoming battles in East Prussia.\n",
      "Apart from the combat situation at the Rawka itself, it was also the withdrawal of troops that forced Army Command 9 to halt the attacks. In total, there were six infantry and two cavalry divisions that the 9th Army had released for use on other battlefields from January 1 to early February. In return, it was only reinforced with the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Cavalry Division from the Bugnyik Army, which was used to strengthen the Vistula defense.\n",
      "After this weakening and the protracted, costly battles that led to the complete exhaustion of the deployed troops, the 9th Army could initially not be expected to undertake any far-reaching offensive operations. Therefore, on February 5, the Commander-in-Chief East ordered it to hold the Russian forces standing before the army front and to reinforce the captured positions as sustainably as possible, since \"the possibility of withdrawing even more forces from the 9th Army had to be reckoned with\" and \"the positions once gained must not be given up under any circumstances.\" Furthermore, the army was to prevent any enemy crossing of the Vistula on the Wyszogrod—Mloclawek stretch and to bind the attention of the enemy troops north of the river through active operations on the southern bank.\n",

      "In view of the continuous weakening of the enemy on this front, the Commander-in-Chief East was able to withdraw another 2½ infantry divisions and one cavalry division from the 9th Army unnoticed from mid to late February. The calm at the front was only interrupted on February 22 by stronger Russian attacks in the sector of the XXV Reserve Corps on the right bank of the Rawka. While weaker attacks south of Wola-Szydlowo were unsuccessful, the Russians managed a breakthrough at Mogily on the 24th in greater breadth. However, a breakthrough was thwarted in heavy, nocturnal fighting with the use of reserves; the involvement of their own artillery was limited due to a shortage of ammunition.\n",

In the middle, the Corps Zastrow formed the core on both sides of the road Mława—Giechanow, while the left wing behind the Drzyc was formed by the Leib Hussar Brigade of the 2nd Cavalry Division. The Russians stood with combat contact directly opposite. Their operations were mainly directed against the weak western wing at Sierpc, Biezun, and Radzanowo.

Thus, for the time being, the security of the connections from East Prussia across the Vistula and the flank protection of the 8th Army seemed to be ensured.\n",
      "Another concern of the Commander-in-Chief East was the reorganization of the 8th Army. The previous organization might have sufficed for the positional battles, where active and reserve troops, Landwehr, Landsturm, and replacements, were only occasionally grouped from the smallest units and equipped with auxiliary formations, fighting side by side. However, for the impending attack and subsequent mobile warfare, a strict organization had to be established. Troops hastily withdrawn from positions, barely mobile, had to be equipped for use in the open field, numerous detached small units had to be reintegrated into their higher formations according to military organization, and makeshift new formations had to be dissolved again.\n",
      "It was a serious decision to place the fate of the impending operation primarily on the shoulders of the new corps, which had been welded together under the most difficult conditions in a few weeks. At the beginning of December, the young recruits had been enlisted, and by the end of the month, the general commands had convened. At the beginning of January, the divisions were in full training at the troop training grounds; this was carried out under considerable friction, mainly due to the limited available time and the scarcity of war materials. Not all gaps could be closed in the short training period. A compensation for deficiencies, which always adhere to young new formations, was created by using the experiences made with the new formations of the past autumn, by assigning a strong core of seasoned men, 300 men per battalion, to the troops. Thus, the young corps consisted at least one-third of war-experienced replacements. The intended number of eleven active officers for each battalion was not reached everywhere, but in both lower and higher leadership positions, only men who were already familiar with the war were present.</body>\n",

The short winter day was coming to an end. Carrying out the attack was no longer feasible. In full combat readiness, the divisions rested close to the enemy.\n",
      "The conditions were even more difficult for the XXXIX Reserve Corps. Here lay a large swampy forest area in front of the front, which had to be bypassed. The commanding general, General v. Lauenstein, ordered the 77th Reserve Division to initiate the attack from Löbegallen against the forest section of the Schoreller Forest protruding to the west, but to first obtain instructions from the general command in case of strong resistance. The 78th Reserve Division was to bypass the forest area northwards via Lasdehnen and gain space as quickly as possible in the direction of Schillehnen. By 10 a.m., it was already apparent that the set goals would not be reached anywhere near. The vanguard of the 77th Reserve Division, after barely a two-hour march, having covered only five kilometers, had to take a two-hour rest to close up the completely dispersed marching column. Only from 11 a.m. did Major General Broitzus deploy his division against the forest corner south of Löbegallen, but initially only sent patrols against the forest edges to make the encirclement of the 78th Reserve Division effective. This division faced even greater difficulties. As it had to swing far to the north, it was unavoidable that its advance led through the accommodation area of the left neighboring corps via Lasdehnen. However, the columns had not yet cleared the paths, which were therefore blocked. When the head of the column approached Lasdehnen at 2 p.m., a rest was necessary until 4 p.m. due to complete exhaustion and disintegration of the marching column, and an effective encirclement of the enemy held by the 77th Reserve Division at Löbegallen was no longer to be expected from the 78th Reserve Division for that day. General v. Lauenstein therefore sent Major General Broitzus the order to attack at Löbegallen. However, this came on February 8 due to the advanced time of day, which made an attack feasible. The 78th Reserve Division resumed at 5 p.m. and, after a short march along the marching road, with the foremost parts four kilometers south of Lasdehnen, went to rest.</body>\n",

      "The Army High Command 10 had been able to keep informed of all events until the afternoon, as the troops had hardly crossed the previous security line of the 1st Cavalry Division and the telephone connections to the staffs were working flawlessly. One thing seemed certain: the enemy was not yet aware of the danger he was in. Reconnaissance had detected no retreating movements by the enemy until 4 p.m.; only a Russian radio message at 3 p.m., which became known in Insterburg at 5 p.m., indicated that the enemy was beginning to sense the start of a major battle. Under the given circumstances, withdrawing the 1st Cavalry Division was not yet conceivable, nor was concentrating the 5th Guards Infantry Brigade. It was foreseeable that only weak parts of both formations would be available on February 9.\n",
      "The Army High Command did not need to issue new orders for February 9. The marching routes were distributed over days, and nowhere had the initial situation changed so decisively that intervention would have been necessary. The guiding thought remained: holding the enemy on the southern flank, gaining as much ground as possible on the northern flank.\n",
      "The XXXVIII Reserve Corps used the night hours to work its way up to the enemy positions. At dawn, Russian positions were stormed; by 11 a.m., the enemy had been thrown back with a total loss of 1900 prisoners and four machine guns. Even laterally from the breach points, he only cleared his front line and tried to reposition further back, with Russians and about 5 km northwest of Pillkallen. On the instructions of the Army High Command, the commanding general, General of the Cavalry v. der Marwitz, who was originally inclined to clear the right division, ordered the general pursuit of Pillkallen in the afternoon. Russians, that the enemy cleared there, was occupied by the 75th Reserve Division. The 76th Reserve Division, advancing on both sides of the railway to Pillkallen under Lieutenant General Elstert, encountered only slight resistance.

Müller had moved south along the railway towards Willuhnen after a light skirmish. The General Command urged faster progress; if the XXI Army Corps did not join, the march would have to be directed eastward. The division stayed on the heels of the enemy, repeatedly shelled by its rear artillery.\n",
      "The two divisions of the XXI Army Corps were to advance on both sides of the Sejstuppe to reach Wladyslawow. The 42nd Infantry Division approached Schillehnen at 3:30 p.m. Weak enemy cavalry had retreated eastward. The advance of the 31st Infantry Division experienced significant delays at the Jothja section. The 30 m deep cut banks were so frozen that guns and vehicles had to be lowered individually on ropes. They could not keep pace with the infantry. Only by 11:00 a.m. had the vanguard overcome the Jothja section. Resistance from strong enemy cavalry with artillery was quickly broken at several points by an infantry regiment marching as a left flank cover. The division's lead reached Slowitzi around 3 p.m. Russian cavalry with weaker infantry and artillery withdrew southwest on both sides of the Sejstuppe. The blocking detachment at the Niemen was brought up by the division after driving off the enemy at Swargi and initially took over the rear cover of the division at the Jothja, to follow later.\n",
      "The General Command had learned of the successes of the two adjacent corps on the right during the morning battles shortly before noon and passed the reports on to the divisions to encourage them in their particularly difficult fight against roads and weather; since the enemy had still installed heavy artillery in front of the 16th Landwehr Division, the advance of the army corps could show even more brilliant results. Both divisions absolutely had to reach Wladyslawow, all enemy detachments appearing west of their march route had to be dealt with, without the advance suffering. This order took four hours to reach the 31st Infantry Division, and the reports from the divisions to the General Command at Lasdehnen even took nine hours.</body>\n",

      "The 42nd Infantry Division continued its march from Schillehnen just west of the border towards Schirwindt at dusk. Several weaker enemy columns with artillery were sighted marching east. At 5:30 p.m., Lieutenant General v. Bredow ordered the main body north of Schillehnen to rest, and the vanguard to occupy Schirwindt and Waldylankowo. However, the troops' strength was no longer sufficient to meet this demand. The vanguard reached Losz zahlen, eleven kilometers north of Schirwindt, at 11 p.m. There it became known that enemy troops of all arms had been passing through towards Schirwindt all day until 7 p.m. After a 1½-hour rest, a detachment was set in motion towards Schirwindt, which it reached on February 10 at 3 a.m. The Russians had destroyed the place from the ground up, but Waldylankowo was almost intact. There was lively activity under bright lighting, and the Sejzuppe Bridge was occupied. Despite the enormous efforts behind them, the troops engaged in battle. Gunfire also echoed from the other riverbank; the 31st Infantry Division was also on site.\n",
      "It had received the last corps order just as the order to transition to rest was being prepared. Now, despite the troops' fatigue, the march continued; a large part of the guns and vehicles was still far behind. An enemy attempt to destroy the Sejzuppe Bridge was thwarted. With concern, each of the new stream sections that crossed the march road was anticipated. The bridge over the Alupka was, however, undamaged. At 7 p.m., the vanguard entered the northern section, which the enemy vacated after a brief firefight. From here, the available cavalry was advanced to Waldylankowo, followed by the division fighting in deep snow and against the icy wind.

The infantry of the Russian northern wing, parts of the 27th Infantry, the 56th and 73rd Reserve Divisions, had been engaged. After heavy losses, they hurried as remnants to the Niemen. Pursuing them could not be the task of the assault wing. Rather, it was about trying to capture what was withdrawing from the center of their front to the east.\n",

General Litzmann set the advance for February 9 at 6 a.m. The 79th Reserve Division was to bypass Bialla to the east towards Mysken, the 80th Reserve Division was to advance over Drygallen to Reuschendorf, 7 km west of Lyck, and the 2nd Infantry Division was to reach the road Drygallen—Arys by circling east of Lake Roß. However, serious difficulties arose in executing this order. The troops of the 79th and 80th Reserve Divisions were so exhausted by the great efforts, almost without night rest and with the failure of supply that further advance before noon was not possible.\n",
      "Only the 2nd Infantry Division, as ordered, advanced at 6 a.m. over the counter-move east of Johannesburg and reached the pivot section at Rubken by noon, from where it was to march further north. Instead, they were redirected east by General Litzmann to cover the advance of the XXXX Reserve Corps, which was swinging in against the Lyck—Reuschendorf line at Drygallen. Here stood the enemy. The division attacked them during the afternoon but could no longer break their resistance. A mixed detachment left north of Johannesburg to block the road to Arys was also engaged in combat there.\n",
      "By midday, the two divisions of the XXXX Reserve Corps had also set out. The 79th Reserve Division again faced great difficulties on the field paths south of Bialla. The horses soon reached the limits of their performance in the deep snow. Most of the men had not received warm food the previous day, and on this day the field kitchens could not follow on the snow-covered paths. Major General Boësz therefore intended to advance with his division up to the height of Bialla.

On his own responsibility, he therefore ordered at 2:30 PM in Bialla: \"Reinforced XXXX Reserve Corps continues the advance in an easterly direction with all forces.\" The following were to march: the 79th Reserve Division from Bialla along the border towards Prostkern, the 80th Reserve Division with the vanguard over the crossing of the Lyk River at Lipinsken (north of Prostkern), their vanguard and the 2nd Infantry Division against the lake positions south and southwest of Lyk. Every resistance was to be broken, the destruction of the Russian 10th Army being the guiding thought of all actions. The 3rd Cavalry Brigade, which had been held up by strong enemy resistance south of Drygallen, was ordered to penetrate between the large lakes south of Lyk, advancing against the roads leading from Lyk to Augustowo and thus blocking them.\n",
      "The 79th Reserve Division only advanced on Prostkern at 4:00 PM. After a strenuous night march with frequent and long pauses on open roads, during which the stranded vehicles and guns were shoveled out of the snow, the division rested in the early morning hours of the new day with the beginning about 8 km before Prostkern on the march road. The 80th Reserve Division was halted between Drygallen and Lyk by enemies, who offered stubborn resistance a few kilometers northeast of Monethen, and wanted to continue the attack the next morning. It was only through the intervention of the general command at night that they were prompted to set their troops in motion in the new direction in an overtaking pursuit; the previous vanguard, a reinforced infantry regiment, remained in front of the previous enemy.\n",
      "The 2nd Infantry Division only received the corps order to continue the march when it wanted to rest in the afternoon after a laborious march on bad roads with the beginning at Steden. It was only a few kilometers forward in the direction of Lyk. In their foremost lines, the enemy withdrew by evening. North of Johannisburg, the opponent had withdrawn. The 3rd Cavalry Brigade reached the same level as the infantry tips between the 79th and 80th Reserve Divisions with heavily fatigued horses on this day. The demolition of the Lyk–Opowice railway was successful at three points north of Prostkern.\n",

      "Opposite the northern wing of the army, the enemy seemed by no means willing to give up their positions. Only after some quite heavy fighting could the German divisions penetrate almost the entire front into the Russian trenches. The reports received during the day at the army headquarters stated that the III Siberian Corps and the XXVI Corps were in full retreat to Lyck and Marggrabowa; the remaining parts of the enemy still seemed to hold strong rearguards in front of the line Goldap–Tolminkehmen. The command of the Russian 10th Army had been moved from Marggrabowa to Suwalki, the general command of the III Siberian Corps from Grabnick to Lyck.\n",
      "Whether General v. Below had been informed of the independent change in the marching direction of the divisions of the southern assault wing of the 8th Army is not known. He ordered for February 11: \"The right wing of the army continues its movement to overtake the pursuit of the enemy's southern wing. The other army units continue their attacks on Schimatsche.\" For renewed fighting at Lyck, which the commander-in-chief apparently expected, the command authorities were arranged so that all troops south of the lake line Artys–Lyck should come under the command of General Litzmann. He left it at the ordered march direction to the east.\n",
      "On February 11, the 79th Reserve Division, with its foremost parts supported by the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, took Proßken after a brief skirmish and then, with its troops exhausted from the night march, rested at the Bornarschstraße. The 3rd Cavalry Brigade, marching towards the lake areas of Spirditten, reached the road Aulowen–Rajgrod after a short skirmish with a stronger opponent. The 80th Reserve Division began its rightward march early in the morning. In a snowstorm, the marching columns advanced only gradually with unspeakable difficulties. General Bächmann decided not to use the poor field roads leading directly to Lipniken, but to turn onto the highway to R.-Rogallen to join the 79th Reserve Division there. This change corresponded to the wishes of the commanding general, who considered a rapid gathering of the strongest possible forces necessary to encircle the enemy in full retreat.</body>\n",

      "At Lyck, on February 14, the Russian southern flank, to cover the retreat, resisted at Neuendorf and lost 1500 prisoners. The 2nd Infantry Division and parts of the 11th Landwehr Division occupied Lyck at noon without a fight, which was heavily devastated and partly still burning. The pursuit continued, temporarily halted by the destruction of bridges, until it encountered new resistance from the enemy east of the Gr. Selment Lake. The northern flank of the army followed up to the line north end of Gr. Selment Lake—Raczki. Marggrabowa had already been occupied on the night of February 14. At Raczki, parts of the Russian XXVI Corps offered stubborn resistance to the attacking ⅓ 3rd Reserve Division.

      "Finally, the great lake barrier Rajgrod—Lyck—Marggrabowa had fallen. The battle had already lasted a full eight days. The III Siberian Corps had escaped the intended encirclement, albeit with heavy losses. With astonishing tenacity, the Siberians had held up the pursuer at tactically important points. Whether they had been thrown at Lyck and Rajgrod or had retreated on orders in view of the impending encirclement, the army command did not yet know. It had to try to intercept the enemy now at Augustow; here was the last opportunity to do so. It was known from Russian radio messages that the staffs of the III Siberian and XXVI Reserve Corps were in Augustow, and that of the XX Army Corps in Suwalki. From a position 150 kilometers wide, the 8th Army had launched an attack. The front had changed daily, and units that became available were withdrawn in time by the command.

Reports of the enemy west of Lake Wysbitzer led General b. der Mauritz to deviate from orders, allowing only a detachment of the main body of the 75th Reserve Division to march west of the lake, while contact was made with the 10th Landwehr Division of the 8th Army. Both army wings had Suwalki as their target. The 42nd Infantry Division could only capture stragglers from a strong enemy column marching from Kalwarja to Simno. General v. Below had urged the 1st Cavalry Division to block the passes at Simno and Seirje as soon as possible. However, an order from Army Command 10 directed them to pursue towards Preny.

Of the units designated for securing against Kowno, the 16th Landwehr Division reached Kibarty, and the 5th Guard Wladyslawow.\n",
      "In a vast semicircle centered on Suwalki, German forces encircled the Russian 10th Army, whose command was still in the city according to one of its radio messages. The burning question was whether the enemy would manage to escape the pincer movement. For the eastward flanking maneuver of the 10th Army, it was disadvantageous that its inner wing closely joined the 8th Army approaching Suwalki from the northwest. In any case, the 10th Army faced heavy fighting ahead. Army Command 10 issued no special orders. Only the 1st Cavalry Division received the directive: \"Relentless pursuit to Preny. Destroy the Wirballen—Kowno railway to the fortress and the Kowno—Wilna railway!\"\n",

      "From the 42nd Infantry Division, a mixed detachment (a company without baggage, one and a half squadrons, a battery with sleds) under Major v. Fabland marched to Sejny early in the morning. After a day's march of 37 km on roads completely softened by the warming sun, they approached Sejny in the afternoon and encountered strong Russian food and livestock transports, which were captured after a brief fight with the escort. Late in the evening, the vanguard under General v. Etorff also arrived in the town; the division took quarters in the Sejny—Widugier area. General v. Etorff reported: \"The troops are at the end of their capacity and cannot march before tomorrow noon.\" However, he could also report further: \"It appears that the enemy has crossed the Widugier—Sejny line with all parts and we are now behind the enemy army.\" A little later, the radio message from the army corps headquarters arrived, pointing to the Russian columns in retreat and concluding with the words: \"Great success awaits.\" The 31st Infantry Division had also sent ahead a detachment that arrived in Serje late in the evening. The bulk of the division reached Lodziejie in complete darkness.\n",
      "Once again, the troops had worked exemplary in the face of unspeakable difficulties of leadership, even exceeding their demands. The achievements of the XXI Army Corps on this day must be described as the highest in marching capability that can be expected from the infantry. The 42nd Infantry Division had covered 35 to 40 kilometers on the worst roads in running snow. The main roads from Suwalki to the Niemen were now blocked. The enemy, still fighting in the area around Suwalki, had to either give way at Augustow by turning southeast from the north. Then he got into the large forests southwest of Augustow and Grodno. The drive forward, which had enabled the divisions to achieve such seemingly impossible feats, fully corresponded to the spirit that prevailed in the general staff of the XXI Army Corps.

The 3rd Cavalry Brigade found the crossing at the Ssipnowo lock occupied. On the orders of the Commander-in-Chief East, the 4th Cavalry Division was now also assigned to block the roads leading from Augustow to the southeast by advancing over Krasnybor the next day. General Litzmann also sent a strong regiment of the 80th Reserve Division marching in the same direction. On the orders of the Commander-in-Chief East, a reinforced infantry regiment from the 79th Reserve Division was also sent ahead to Augustow during the night, to join hands with the parts of the 10th Army advancing there from the northeast. The main forces of both divisions were to follow from Barglow to Augustow early the next day. North of the XXXX Reserve Corps, the 2nd Infantry Division from the area east of Lyk had laboriously advanced on the roads covered with deep wet snow in rainy weather, especially since they were supported by several side columns of the 11th Landwehr Division marching south. The enemy offered serious resistance only in the evening just beyond the national border. The ⅓ 3rd Reserve Division had thrown the enemy at Raczki after fierce fighting early in the morning, but soon encountered new resistance on the march to Augustow, which could only be broken after the intervention of Lieutenant General Clausius with the replacement brigade of his 10th Landwehr Division. The attack carried further against the road to Augustow brought the brigade 1000 prisoners. Rich food supplies in Raczki benefited the troops, whose heavy artillery and baggage train could not reach them that day due to the broken poor road conditions.

The Supreme Commander East adhered to his plan to carry out operations against the Russian 10th Army, which was expected to be encircled in the forest of Augustów, under all circumstances until the complete destruction of this army; however, it remained to be seen whether the next operational goal, the breakthrough to Białystok, could still be achieved. By February 15, a certain change in the perception of the situation had already begun, but it was not yet reflected in the orders. Initially, Field Marshal von Hindenburg limited himself to emphasizing the importance of the roads leading southeast from Augustów; the XXXX Reserve Corps and the 2nd Infantry Division were to immediately advance through Augustów, and the 4th Cavalry Division was to proceed for an overtaking pursuit via the Sopienow lock.\n",
      "Even on February 16, the 8th Army had not yet reached the canal crossings near Augustów. That night, a severe snowstorm had again destroyed most of the wire lines; the roads became even worse. The Russians stubbornly held their rear guards in fortified positions, which were a few kilometers west and southwest of the town, leaning right on Lake Necko and left on the marshy canal lowlands near Netta. Against this bridgehead position, the 79th Reserve, both parts of the 80th Reserve Division, reinforced 2nd Infantry, and ⅓ 3rd Reserve Division under the unified command of General Litzmann attacked. However, there was no room for encirclements, and the frontal attack took time. As night fell, only local successes were achieved. The hope of inflicting more serious damage on the retreating enemy here was diminished, as all attempts to reach further south across the canal and intercept the Russians at the Bobr crossings near Stabin and Krasnobór failed due to the unfavorable terrain and weather despite all the troops' dedication. Two detachments from the 80th Reserve Division, pushed against the enemy's retreat routes at Barszcze and Barglow, were just as unsuccessful as the 4th Cavalry Division in crossing the canal that day. The bridges were destroyed, and the several kilometers wide swamp strip on both sides of the canal was under enemy fire, who occupied the forest edges on the opposite bank.</body>\n",

In the large Russian barracks located just south of there, 3000 prisoners, six guns, and a flag were captured by the division. Unstoppably, they continued in the darkness towards Augustow, which was occupied at 5 a.m. without significant resistance; the number of prisoners and captured guns doubled.\n",
      "In the 10th Army, the disturbances caused by the weather on February 16th had an even more adverse effect, as the actually critical hours were only approaching for the widely spread encircling wing, while it became increasingly clear that the compressed inner wing of the army would no longer be able to strike.\n",
      "The XXXVIII Reserve Corps had received orders to leave the 76th Reserve Division as army reserve at Suwalki and to advance only with the 75th Reserve Division on Augustow. This division met the 10th Landwehr Division at 5 p.m. at Oczko, which was already advancing on Augustow after successfully concluding battles at Raczki and Suwalki. The 75th Reserve Division had no choice but to let General Clausius's Landwehr take precedence and then to rest between Augustow and Suwalki. The 76th Reserve Division remained at Suwalki; strong security forces were pushed forward to the southeast.\n",

In heavy fighting southwest of Matzare, the reserve lost eight guns and two machine guns. The rest of the units, barely more than 250 men, retreated to Tronki.

With a firm hand, he intervened to disentangle the troop concentration at Augustow and assign new tasks to the armies according to the changed circumstances. The prerequisite for carrying out this new operation was the conclusion of the battles with the Russian 10th Army in the large forest area, whose successful outcome the Commander-in-Chief East could now hardly doubt, as the reorganization of the forest terrain was making ever further progress.\n",
      "The focus of the 8th Army had now shifted; from the ever-lengthening flank at Narew and Bobr, a new front had emerged. East of the Vistula, two new hotspots had emerged north of Lomza and near Przasnysz. The German artillery deployment was taking place in front of Ojcowice. The swampy terrain, as in the autumn of 1914, posed the greatest difficulties for the infantry's advance.\n",
      "The situation at Lomza caused serious concern. Caucasian and Guard troops had been newly identified there. It had become known from Russian radio messages that two Russian armies had been formed on the Bobr—Narew front: on the right flank the 12th Army, with its headquarters in Ostrow, with three corps, and on the lower Narew the 1st Army, also with three corps and a cavalry corps; its headquarters was in Jablonna.

Wherever they encountered the enemy, they always faced stubborn resistance, which, despite all the troops' eagerness to attack, was not always quickly broken, as the artillery could not always keep pace with the infantry. In the order given by the army high command responsible for further directing the battle on February 18, it stated: \"The remnants of the enemy armies have fled to Grodno and Olita, 60,000 prisoners, 65 guns, 98 machine guns, countless vehicles and war equipment of all kinds remained in the hands of the 8th and 10th Army.\" After the pursuit, the XXXX Reserve Corps and ½ I Army Corps were to reach the area south of the Bobr and further east, followed by the XXXVIII Reserve Corps to the area southeast of Augustowo to Bornarsch on Lipsk. The XXI Army Corps was tasked with continuing to block the previous positions with the 31st Infantry Division and bringing the 42nd Infantry Division into the area south of Sopodzinie. At its disposal, the 77th Reserve Division was set in motion from the area of Sejny to Sopodzinie. The general command of the XXXIX Reserve Corps was to assemble the 78th Reserve Division at Berzniki as soon as possible. The three groups of flank protection at Sereje, Simno, and Marjampol—Wylkowyski retained their task. The 4th Cavalry Division was set on Janow, the 1st Cavalry Division on Sidra. According to a report received early on February 18 from the 2nd Squadron of the 9th Uhlan Regiment, which had left Rajgrod on the morning of February 14 as a reconnaissance squadron of the 4th Cavalry Division, enemy forces of about a corps strength had been detected in the Plaska area the day before. This operationally important report confirmed the presence of still strong enemy forces in the woods; they must have been very exhausted; the squadron, which pursued the retreating enemy, captured 220 Russians during the day. The target of the 1st Cavalry Division was south of the Bobr. However, it found the Bobr section between Lipsk and Grodno occupied and could not overcome it. In the area of Dombrowo, Russian columns were still observed moving eastward. At the decisive point of the battlefield, west of Grodno, the 31st Infantry Division succeeded on February 18 in repelling all enemy attempts to emerge from the forest south of the canal towards Grodno. In doing so, all regiments of the Russian 28th and 29th Infantry Division as well as about 24 guns were certainly identified.</body>\n",

This required regrouping and thus time. The heavy fighting and efforts of the winter battle had taken the mental and physical strength of the troops to the extreme limit. Nevertheless, rest and recovery were not yet possible; for the enemy, who was strengthening daily, proceeded to counterattacks along the entire front.\n",
      "Generaloberst v. Eichhorn faced a very difficult task. The ice cover of the Bobr still held, but the thawing of the last few days had softened the swamps again. The smaller Bobr arms could not be kept open, but in any case, it was necessary to overcome an exposed, many kilometers wide lowland in view of the enemy. Moreover, the task was hardly solvable with the Grodno fortress in flank and rear. The command of the 10th Army had not yet abandoned the intention to attack Grodno. The Commander-in-Chief East, however, seemed to assess the situation differently in view of the events at the Narew. He did not give permission for the attack on Grodno, for which the 77th Reserve Division was intended. The further development of the situation then forced the plans regarding the Niemen fortresses to recede.\n",

      "During the next day, February 23, signs increased that Russian columns were advancing from the east, south, and southwest to relieve Przasnysz. By the evening of the day, the situation was such that a retreat of the enemy, who was strengthening his position everywhere, was no longer to be assumed. The Wernitz Division did gain further ground with its left flank and thereby made contact with the I Reserve Corps north of Wola, closing the ring around Przasnysz. However, the right flank of the division only slowly worked its way towards very strong Russian positions. Further action here was eventually halted.\n",
      "In contrast, the I Reserve Corps made good progress in the attack on Przasnysz with the 1st Reserve Division. The barracks on the eastern edge of the city were stormed, capturing over 2000 prisoners, three guns, and three machine guns from the Russian 63rd Reserve Division.</body>\n",

Attacked by the vastly superior forces of the I Siberian Corps, the 36th Reserve Division had to retreat about two kilometers. From the east, the Russians advanced with the II Siberian Corps over the Orzyc. General Freiherr v. Gagern, with his Landwehr, who had fought so brilliantly in the winter battle a few days earlier, was unable to withstand this attack with stronger forces. Without much effort, the Russians threw back the 9th Landwehr Brigade north of the Przasnysz—Krasnosielc road. At Dembning, the 6th Infantry Brigade managed to intercept the Russian thrust, but south of there, the Russians advanced to the Wengierka. The situation had become serious. Danger threatened especially from the northeast. In the evening, all German troops from the Division Wernitz, including up to the Orzyc, were placed under General v. Morgen's command. He ordered the 36th Reserve and 3rd Infantry Divisions to defend against the south and east on February 26, while the 1st Reserve Division was moved far north to strike the northern Russian flank with a thrust to the southeast. However, on February 26, heavy fighting occurred only on the southern front, but it did not bring any decisive change in the situation. General v. Gallwitz now believed he had to expect a major Russian attack against the army detachments. According to reliable observations, troops were unloaded at Ostrow and on the railway line to the south. Reports from the front indicated that the enemy was advancing stronger forces in the direction of Przasnysz. On the German side</body>\n",

All incoming reports, including valuable aerial reports, indicated a strong influx of Russian reinforcements to the Niemen—Narew front. The enemy seemed to focus on the Lomza—Przasnysz section. German reinforcements had to be directed there. For the operational wing at Grodno, the available forces were no longer available. The intense attacks threatening from Bobr and Narew gradually deprived the Eastern Commander-in-Chief of the initiative despite his great victory.

      "<body>The operational plan for the spring envisaged an offensive from the south against East Prussia. This was not a new line of thought; similar ideas had played a role before the war in the development of the Franco-Russian alliance and in the preparation of the deployment. Besides the common interests of the alliance, the season was now a decisive factor, as the Russians still considered a major German attack during their offensive against Austria-Hungary possible despite the events on the French theater of war and feared the threat to their flanks and rear from East Prussia. The Russian leadership also hoped for a tactical success in East Prussia, as the other German front sections seemed too strongly developed and occupied. The newly to be formed 12th Army under General Plehwe was to advance from the line Ostrolenka—Pultusk to Ortelsburg—Soldau by the end of February, supported on the right by vigorous pressure from the 10th Army and on the left by demonstrations of the troops at Mlawa.\n",
      "Despite these intentions, the Supreme Army Command had no reservations about taking the XXII Corps from the 10th Army in East Prussia in January to respond to a call for help from the Southwestern Front.\n",
      "By the end of January, the 1st, 2nd, and 5th Armies were positioned closely against the enemy west of the Vistula since the November and December battles; combat activity remained constantly active. The situation on the East Prussian front was calmer. General Ruski, the commander-in-chief of the Northwestern Front, had designated ten infantry and seven cavalry divisions for the 12th Army to be formed north of Warsaw. In the assembly area of this army, only the I Turkestan Corps and 4½ cavalry divisions (4th, 6th, 15th Cavalry, 4th Don Cossack Division, 4th Independent Cavalry Brigade) had been present so far. Newly added were to be: the IV Siberian and XV Corps from the army reserve, the XX Corps from the 10th Army, the 76th and 77th Reserve, 8th and 14th Cavalry Divisions, as well as the Ussuri Cavalry Brigade—all units from the left wing of the army group near Warsaw to West Poland. Since the XV Corps was only ready to march on February 14 in Gomel (north of Kiev), the army's offensive operations were to begin on February 23. In the meantime, they wanted to try to push the enemy back to the border, while the 10th Army had to clear the forest areas in its northern flank of the enemy and extend its right wing to the Inster.</body>\n",

      "<body>Since February 15, no messages have been received from the corps. On the left flank of the army, the III Siberian Corps, along with two to three other divisions, is retreating from Augustów to Lipsk—Stabin, pressed from three sides. \"From Grajewo to Osowiec, an enemy division is advancing, and in the section between the Vistula and Ostwa, the enemy is maneuvering... This situation has forced General Adjutant Ruskij to abandon the counterattack he had planned from the middle Narew.\" He is now taking measures to support the right wing of the army. Prince Kudaschew, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also reported on February 16 from the Great Headquarters about the \"detailed severe defeat at Augustów,\" about the \"extremely difficult situation of the Northwest Front and expressed his fears about whether it would be possible to hold Grodno.\"\n",
      "Now the army group of the Northwest Front also saw the situation of the 10th Army as almost hopeless. They believed that holding the line Sopodjnie—Lipsk—Stabin was hardly feasible, even if the divisions of the 10th Army managed to break through. Apparently later in the evening, the commander-in-chief, General Sievers, reported that Sopodjnie was occupied by German advance troops and the fortress Grodno was endangered. General Ruskij ordered the entire XV Corps from the 2nd Army to Grodno, the II to Svolfa northeast of Białystok; he requested the transport of the Guard Corps to Białystok instead of Osowiec. From the left bank of the Vistula, two more corps were to be brought in, namely the II Siberian to the 12th Army and the V Corps to Warsaw.\n",
      "On February 17, Grand Duke Nicholas attended a meeting with the commanders-in-chief of the two army groups in Siedlce, the headquarters of the Northwest Front. General Ruskij explained that the Germans were now moving strong forces from the left bank of the Vistula into the area of Mława. Here he expected an attack, so that the 12th and 1st Armies now faced a double encirclement due to the 10th Army's sortie. To counter this threat, he intended to gather all available forces from the left bank of the Vistula and concentrate them in the Grodno—Białystok area in the entire seventh corps. This assembly could be completed by March 3. Only five corps would then remain on the left bank of the Vistula. The Grand Duke agreed with this. General Ruskij proposed again, in connection with this regrouping, to withdraw the front on the left of the Vistula to near Warsaw.</body>\n",

      "<body>With regard to the right wing of the Southwest Front, the Grand Duke again rejected the proposal.\n",
      "The focus of the Northwest Front in the coming days was mainly on the area of Mlawa. On February 18, the 10th Army was informed that the enemy's measures indicated an offensive along the Vistula and at Mlawa, as well as in the direction of Lomza. Therefore, the previously planned strong attack by the 12th Army was not feasible for the time being; rather, one must also expect a German attack in this section.\n",
      "At the same time, the threatening development of the situation at the 10th Army led to the fact that the deployment of the 12th Army did not materialize even in the manner ordered on February 15. General Plehwe had to hand over the II and XV Corps to the 10th Army, in return for which the III Caucasian Corps, previously destined for Drany, was to be assigned to him. Meanwhile, however, a setback occurred on the night of February 18 at his own front; as it later turned out, insufficient reporting on the fortress's expectations.\n",
      "General Ruzski still considered the overall situation of the army group unclear on February 19. He rejected a request from the 1st Army for deployment, as the enemy was not only offensive at the Plock—Siedlce—Przasnysz front but also in the sections of the 12th and 10th Armies. The uncertainty about which part of the Northwest Front the Germans intended to strike made it necessary to keep a strong reserve. The I Siberian Corps was designated as such, which was also advancing from West Poland.\n",
      "On February 20, the Supreme Army Command received news of the advance of two German corps on Kalwarja and Marjampol. The concern about an attack over the Njemen came to the forefront again. However, General Ruzski had a different view. He assumed that the main German forces would be directed against the Grodno—Ostrolenka line and wanted to counter them with an advance, for which the previously held forces of the 12th Army (2¾ Corps) were already advancing north from Lomza on that day, February 20. Under these circumstances, the Supreme Army Command left it to the Northwest Front to decide whether to form an attack group at Drany if necessary and no longer insisted on the demand to hold the Baura—Rawa position under all circumstances in the event of a German attack.</body>\n",

      "<body>In the 12th Army, the attack ordered for February 20th was \"a regrettable failure.\" The Russians' hope of gaining a few days' advantage here was not fulfilled. Similarly, on February 21st, the relief attack by parts of the XV, II, and XXVI Corps from the Grodno area to rescue the parts of the 10th Army surrounded by the enemy and fighting with utmost determination was a complete failure. The fate of the four divisions trapped in the vast forest area of Augustow at Wolküz was thus sealed. General Russki was deeply impressed by the persistent German attacks at Przasnysz and now expected the main German attack over the middle Narew towards Warsaw. In his view, \"the decision of the entire war now lay in the Grodno—Warsaw area.\" A success had to be achieved here. Accordingly, the 1st Army received orders to concentrate its forces more sharply to the right in the area south of Mlava. At the same time, the I Siberian Corps was inserted on its right flank. It was to advance together with the II Siberian Corps on the left flank of the 12th Army for a counterattack. Another 3½ divisions were successively moved from the left Vistula bank or designated for relocation; additionally, General Russki requested a corps from the Supreme Army Command. He pointed out the low combat strength of his units on this occasion; for example, the 2nd Army was short of about 127,000 men, 70 guns, and 150 machine guns at full strength; there was also a severe shortage of ammunition.\n",
      "On February 22nd, the 63rd Reserve Division, positioned far ahead of the front at Przasnysz, was encircled by the German attack, but General Plehwe now felt strong enough for a counterattack. In the area from Lomza to southwest of Przasnysz, more than 12 divisions of the 12th and 1st Armies were assembled for this purpose on February 23rd. Stubborn fighting around Przasnysz resulted in the recapture of the city on February 27th, bringing the Russians about 10,000 prisoners. However, the leadership did not feel strong enough for a vigorous pursuit; they were content with the defensive success.</body>\n",

      "<body>XXXX Reserve Corps from February 9 was drawn inward from its eastward movement and then positioned frontally. Valuable time was lost until the divisions could resume their encircling movement. The situation was similar with the 10th Army before Suwalki. The XXXVIII Reserve Corps used an entire division on February 12 to establish the connection ordered to the 8th Army. Their advance to the south west, instead of, as originally intended, east of Lake Wisztytzer, not only resulted in an undesirable accumulation of forces at an operationally and tactically unimportant location northwest of Suwalki, but also contributed to the left neighboring division also getting involved in the battle for this place. This gathering of forces before Suwalki was further delayed by the fact that the commander of the 10th Army on February 15 also brought the divisions of General v. Lauenstein, which were already extending to the southeast, to Suwalki. Here they were militarily fixed for days, while in the forest of Augustow the forces were lacking to close the ring around the Russian divisions at Augustowo and Suwalki. Added to this was the hesitation in continuing the encircling movement, which became apparent on February 14 with the XXI Army Corps. However, even if the 42nd Infantry Division had been immediately thrown into the forest terrain in full strength, it was too weak to prevent the breakthrough of six Russian divisions east of Sejny and Augustow. The failure of the first encirclement attempt delayed the decision by days and gave the Russians time to support the Bobr front by bringing in new forces.\n",
      "Now the risk of the entire operational setup found its visible expression in the growing threat to the flanks. With anticipatory attention, the eyes of the highest leaders were directed from the beginning of the battle to the Niemen and especially to the Narew, to ensure that the commander-in-chief East was continuously concerned with timely reinforcing the endangered front sections to strengthen flank protection. It was not always possible to avoid that, in the constantly worsening situation at the Narew, units were torn apart and troops had to be moved as they were available. And the 9th Army had to be increasingly relied upon. The opponent behaved similarly. Thus, on both sides, there was a continuous movement behind the Vistula front towards the Narew, in which the Russians initially gained an advantage on the inner line, especially since this movement had already begun for them for other reasons at the beginning of January.</body>\n",

Based on our current knowledge of the impact of the diversionary attack at Bolimow-Borzynow, it can be assumed with certainty that the Russians would have retreated to or behind the Vistula in West Poland with a prompt repetition of such attacks. A decisive operation in the East, as originally sought by Field Marshal v. Hindenburg, did not occur this time either due to a lack of available forces.\n",
      "East Prussia was liberated from the Russians for the second time, a new major victory of annihilation was achieved. However, the goal set by the higher command in planning the operation was not reached; the strategic impact sought at the time was denied to the great battle success. Reluctantly and slowly, the high command came to this realization. Until February 26, Field Marshal v. Hindenburg resisted the idea of abandoning the operation. The unsuccessful first unification attempt at Augustow, the failures at Bobr, and the escalation of the situation at Przasnysz were the milestones on the way to the difficult and bitter decision of February 27 to halt further offensives. The crisis on the Eastern front, which had only postponed further victories around Lodz in 1914, was not resolved by the new major battle success, despite all the troops' dedication. With the means available in the East, no decisive result could be achieved in the face of Russian superiority, even if forces had been spared for deployment at the Narew Front for the 10th Army.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the operation did not remain without significant strategic results for the overall situation in the East. The new defeat caused even greater concern in Russia, as this sad prelude to the new campaign plan offered little hope for a change in the situation, which was so urgently needed for internal political reasons.

      "On February 23, the Grand Duke admitted that, given the state of the troops and supplies, he was not in a position to launch a strong counterattack and wrest the initiative from the Germans. According to General Danilow, a strong thrust into West Poland would have been the most suitable means; however, for \"such a bold and responsible maneuver,\" they had neither the necessary means \"nor probably sufficient offensive spirit.\" He also admits the severity of the defeat: \"Russian prestige\" had \"suffered a severe blow for the third time\" in East Prussia, and the conquest of East Prussia had once again been thwarted by the German victory. Since the great defeats of the summer of 1914, the conquest of East Prussia had to be a question that \"due to its unpopularity could never again be openly and fully addressed.\" With a \"certain artificially generated mistrust, even prejudice,\" all thoughts concerning East Prussia were treated, and offensive operations against East Prussia bore \"the character of haphazard half-measures, marked by the stamp of indecision and indecisiveness.\" East Prussia, \"the hornet's nest\" or \"the trap\" as it was called by Russian generals, had cost the Russians three armies. The conquest of East Prussia as a strategic goal was now definitively abandoned. The German victory in the Augustów forests had put an end to the \"long and fruitless struggle in East Prussia,\" which the Russian General Staff had foreseen and feared in its peace considerations of 1908. With Hindenburg's devastating blow against the Russian 10th Army, the plans of the enemy military leadership were also shattered. The shift that the Grand Duke originally wanted to move north was now shifted back to the south. This was a strategic impact of the victory, which at that time could not have been anticipated on the German side.</body>\n",

The own intention is to damage the enemy forces as much as possible, and indeed in the way that is feasible for them, through offensive strikes.” The intention to “advance to a counteroffensive at one point” was thus abandoned. The German Eastern Front was increasingly pushed into defense; the Commander-in-Chief East wanted to conduct this offensively.

On the evening of February 26, the High Command of the 10th Army received the message from the Commander-in-Chief East that a continuation of the offensive was not intended. Two days later, the XXI Army Corps with the attached ½ 2nd Infantry Division was withdrawn unnoticed by the enemy from the fortress area of Grodno to the extended position Rygalowka–Wolynka–Sopoczkinie. On the right, the XXXX Reserve Corps connected from Bobr from Lipitz to the Augustow Canal, on the left from the Augustow Canal to south of Druskeniki, the XXXIX Reserve Corps secured against the middle Njemen. Further north, in a very light deployment, stood the Kosch Group with the 1st Cavalry Division, the 5th Guard Infantry Brigade, and the 16th Landwehr Division up to Jurborg on the lower Njemen, with some smaller and less combat-effective border guard detachments under Major General Baron v. Esebeck north of this river up to the Baltic Sea. According to reliable reports, the enemy had three corps between Sopoczkinie and Grodno, as well as at Grodno, two cavalry divisions at Olita, and one corps at Kowno. According to unconfirmed civilian reports, stronger forces were supposed to gather at Olita for an attack. On March 1, the army command informed the subordinate command authorities that the army would soon be withdrawn to the line Augustow–Krasnopol–Lodzajcie. The 5th Guard Infantry Brigade was withdrawn and transferred to the Gallwitz Army Detachment.</body>\n",

On March 1, they managed to penetrate the weakly occupied German position at Lipsk on the seam between the 80th Reserve and 2nd Infantry Division; however, they were thrown back across the Bobr in a counterattack on March 4, suffering heavy losses and losing 900 prisoners. Similarly, on March 2, a Russian attempt to secure the railway bridge at Ostrow on the northern bank failed; 1500 prisoners remained in German hands. An attack launched on March 4 at the mouth of the Augustowki Canal soon collapsed in the counterattack of the XXXIX Reserve Corps.\n",
      "The Russians also advanced against the flank of the army. During the relief of the 5th Guards Infantry Brigade, the enemy approached their positions from Olita and Kowno; at Sereje, Simno, Dautlze, and Marjampol, there were skirmishes, but they did not take on any serious forms. The imminent danger here, under which the intended backward swing was significantly reduced, which was planned for March 5, was postponed to March 6 due to consideration of a simultaneous backward movement on the extreme right wing of the Austro-Hungarian army<sup>1</sup>.\n",
      "The guiding idea for the future deployment of the army was to regain operational freedom, which was restricted by the favorable Bobr section and the fortress of Grodno. Generaloberst v. Eichhorn hoped that the enemy would follow against Augustow-Suwalki. Then he wanted to seize them by attacking their northern flank. For this, the XXXX Reserve Corps with the ½ 2nd Infantry Division was to occupy the under-construction position Augustowki Canal-Augustow-Wigrn Lake southeast of Suwalki. The XXI Army Corps and XXXIX Reserve Corps were to move in a more northerly direction, left flank on Kalwarja, with the Kosch group covering and concealing this flanking movement against the Russians on the middle Niemen.</body>\n",

Late in the evening, Berzniki was taken, but there were still enemies in Sejny. On March 11, the 42nd Infantry Division was also supposed to attack. An intercepted radio message revealed early on March 11 that the enemy had already ordered a retreat to the northern part of the woods the evening before. The assumption that they would retreat towards Grodno was soon confirmed by aircraft reports. There was no longer any prospect of successfully continuing the encirclement movement; the enemy's lead was too great. The army command therefore contented itself with only allowing the 1st Cavalry Division to follow into the forest, while halting the infantry divisions at the northern edge of the forest. In battles with the enemy's rear guards, the four divisions reached the line Froncki—Jelwa. Exhausted, the 1st Cavalry Division reached Kopciowo and pushed parts forward to the road Giby—Kalety.\n",
      "The hasty withdrawal of the Russians had cleared the way into the flank of the enemy in front of the XXXX Reserve Corps. This corps had attacked heavily south of Augustów in recent days and had even temporarily broken into the German position at Kolnica on March 10. Generaloberst v. Eichhorn hoped to roll up this enemy from the north on March 12 and perhaps outflank them from the south. However, the success did not materialize, as the enemy disappeared behind the river section in time.

Thus, the army was mostly returned to the last position by March 15, ready for a new counterattack if the enemy advanced again. The XXXX Reserve Corps resumed its extensive defensive position south and southeast of Augustów, the XXXIX Reserve Corps moved into the area between Wigry and Galadus Lake, and the XXI Army Corps formed the left wing northeast of this lake; the 1st Cavalry Division remained in the area northwest of Kopciowo in front of the front. In the following days, however, the striking power of the army was reduced by further detachments (General Command I Army Corps, ½ 2nd Infantry Division, 2/78 Reserve Division)</body>\n",

The fact that the previous Kosch Group, now commanded by Lieutenant General Sommer, was reinforced at Wirballen by 2/3 of the 4th Cavalry Division from the 8th Army these days was insignificant compared to the strong infantry tasks. In view of the reduction in forces, Generaloberst v. Eichhorn decided to withdraw the northern wing of his main forces a little further, the XXI Army Corps to Kalvarja, the 1st Cavalry Division to Berzniki, and the detachment of the 16th Landwehr Division previously stationed at Seerze to Lozdzieje. The enemy followed slowly.\n",
      "On March 21, the position of the 1st Cavalry Division east of Sejny became untenable, and the Russians attacked at Punsk as well. Generaloberst v. Eichhorn wanted to let the enemy run as deep as possible into the prepared encirclement this time and withdrew the 77th Reserve Division to a position running from the northern edge of Lake Wigry towards Rutka Tartak, so that from south of Augustow to here, three divisions stood in an extended front facing east. At an angle to this, behind the upper course of the Sejzupa, the 1st Cavalry Division was to join at Ludwinow, the XXI Army Corps at Kalvarja with the front facing south ready to strike. Its flank was covered by securing the 16th Landwehr Division at Ludwinow, Marjampol, and northwards.\n",
      "By March 24, this deployment was completed. The enemy approached only slowly and cautiously. In front of the XXXV Reserve Corps, the III Siberian and XXVI Corps seemed to be advancing, the II Corps advanced over Sejny, the III from Lozdzieje initially westward, but then turned in several columns to the northeast and north; strong cavalry approached the Sejzupa section at Ludwowo ahead of it. But also on the left flank of the XXI Corps, the enemy appeared; here, east of Ludwinow, the 1st Guard Cavalry Division appeared. The entire Russian 10th Army, four corps, and four cavalry divisions marched — as a war diary of the German 10th Army states — generally in the \"direction desired by the German leadership.\"\n",

No further increase in strength was to be expected in the coming weeks due to the strained replacement situation exacerbated by armament difficulties. Bringing in divisions from the German Eastern Front was hardly considered at this time due to the situation there and was not urgent, as the Western offensive could not begin before mid-May at the earliest. On March 20, General v. Falkenhayn therefore warned Field Marshal v. Hindenburg that the withdrawal of forces from the Eastern Army to the West was not envisaged even after the end of March. \"Should nevertheless,\" it continued, \"the necessity for this or for the use of army units now assigned to Your Excellency in the South arise, a timely request will be made there...\"\n",

      "In addition to the replacement situation, the ammunition issue was of particular importance. Not only did a decisive offensive in the West require an unusually high demand for ammunition, but it was also expected that the Eastern Front would then make higher ammunition demands, as a German offensive in the West would likely trigger an attack by the Russians on the Eastern Front.</body>\n",

      "<body>At this time, the provision of the following forces was planned for the disposal of the Supreme Army Command: From March 23 onwards, the following were to be gradually assembled: the Guard Corps around Schlettstadt—Colmar, the XXXXI Reserve Corps around Autun—Avallon—Joigny—Sens, the II Bavarian Army Corps with the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division around Valenciennes—Douai—Cambrai, the III Army Corps with the 113th Infantry Division around Mézières—Amagne—Sedan, the X Army Corps with the 111th Infantry Division around Ath—Mons—Halle—Grammont, and an XXXXII Army Corps to be formed from the 119th, 121st, and possibly a division of the X Reserve Corps in the area of Falkenberg—Bensdorf and near Bitsch. The 2nd and 3rd Armies were each weakened by one infantry division; otherwise, it was a matter of exchanging older infantry divisions for newly formed ones. The decisive factor for the formation of these army corps,\" it continued, \"is the point that the army corps can be quickly assembled by rail or foot march behind the right wing of the army, while at the same time sufficient cover remains for the center and left wing of the army.\"\n",
      "According to this plan, by mid-April, sixteen infantry divisions, seven of them newly formed, were to be available behind the Western Front for the Supreme Army Command. As for cavalry divisions, four were still on the Western Front as of mid-March.\n",
      "Simultaneously, preparations began for the creation of a strong army artillery. By the end of March, they led to a request to the War Ministry for the provision of 40 unhitched heavy batteries of older material with crews from replacement units. They were to be ready for use by mid-April to free up batteries of a new type from the front. A calculation, based on the deployment of a total of ten army corps, showed that, excluding field gun batteries, 624 combat guns would be available for a breakthrough.\n",
      "A second memorandum presented to General v. Falkenhayn on March 19 by the High Command of the 1st Army dealt once again with the questions discussed on the 14th in Mézières. It initially pointed out the dominant point that one must adapt to the available forces and, if necessary, limit oneself to a locally restricted attack. Regarding the choice of the direction of operations, the High Command once again justified its negative judgment.</body>\n",

To timely lure enemy reserves away from the actual attack site, the weather-dependent, still completely untested gas attack was obviously to be interrupted, considering the uncertain weather conditions. On March 19, he inquired with the High Command of the 2nd Army whether a draft for a surprise advance from Fricourt-Mametz and from Dompierre had already been prepared to dislodge the French positions at Maricourt. He wished to know what reinforcements in infantry and artillery and what time expenditure the High Command deemed necessary for such an operation and whether it considered it promising. However, the army leader assessed the manpower requirement as high and the success as not proportionate to it. On March 29, the High Command of the 7th Army was asked to report what increase in forces was deemed necessary to clear the right bank from Berry au Bac downwards from the enemy, and on what day after receiving the order the operation could be carried out. The High Command declared the provision of an army corps and 33 mostly heavy batteries along with corresponding ammunition as sufficient.\n",
      "Even before the results of the initiated major reconnaissance were available, two general directives were issued to the armies of the West at the end of March. The first, from the 29th, dealt with securing the branched positions, which, despite the withdrawal of troop parts from the front, had to be held against superior attacks with minimal losses. A series of measures were recommended for this, concerning the improvement of obstacles, the creation of protective shelters for the entire garrison of the front line, and the use of concrete, the expansion of connections, rear positions and support points, as well as the thorough preparation of artillery use. Subsequently, the army high commands generally demanded \"detailed reconnaissance for the attack.\" \"These can serve as a general basis, that in an attack possibly ordered by the Supreme Army Command, each division will be assigned a business strip of 2.5–3 km to three infantry regiments in double line. The attack plans must primarily deal with the overthrow of the opposing enemy with all technical and artillery means, but must be thoroughly prepared in this regard. It should be achieved that \"both the defense and the attack are prepared for completion at every point.\"</body>\n",

The Romanian Prime Minister had emphasized to the Austro-Hungarian envoy that his position would become untenable if the Russians were to occupy not only Bukovina but also Transylvania, as the general desire to \"march in to be rewarded by the Russians with Transylvania\" would be irresistible. General v. Conrad had hoped, however, to soon eliminate these threatening dangers to the foreign policy situation through the expected victory on the Carpathian front. In agreement with him, Baron Burian, appointed on January 13 (in place of Count Berchtold) as Austro-Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, was determined to await the outcome of the impending operations and to temporarily refrain from responding to Italian claims and related suggestions from the German side. The written and oral exchange of ideas conducted in January between the chiefs of staff of the allied armies revealed a sharp contrast in views on this issue, which, similar to the Serbian question, ultimately had its deeper roots in the conflict of opinions on the conduct of military operations. While General v. Conrad believed that the defeat of Russia was possible and that all difficulties of the political situation would then resolve themselves, General v. Falkenhayn did not count on a settlement of the war in the East and therefore considered it necessary to secure the neutrality of Italy and Romania through territorial concessions by the Danube Monarchy. The increasingly strong pressure exerted by the German political and military authorities on Vienna eventually caused such discontent that the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Baron Burian deemed a personal discussion necessary. He accompanied the Archduke heir to the throne to the German Great Headquarters on January 24. The attempt to assert the Austro-Hungarian position on the cession issue was unsuccessful and did not change the existing opposition. When the battles in the Carpathians then brought the Central Powers only a hoped-for military success, General v. Falkenhayn felt it his duty to inform Chancellor v. Bethmann Hollweg in a telegram on February 6 about the poor prospects of the further Carpathian offensive, stating that \"a general shift in favor of the allied troops could no longer be expected there in the foreseeable future.\"</body>\n",

Accordingly, the strongest pressure will naturally be exerted on Romania. Your Excellency, I also ask you to use your high influence on the Dardanelles defenders to ensure they do not lose their composure. The Dardanelles are indeed impregnable even with very limited ammunition, as long as they are bravely defended, and a Turkish army certainly does not lack brave men. A winter campaign against Serbia was impossible due to road and weather conditions. However, even after improving these conditions, it will not be carried out quickly enough for its outcome to be significant for the current attack on the Dardanelles. Nevertheless, due to its importance for the general situation in the Balkans, it should be expedited by all means.”\n",
      "Romania's stance had been very fluctuating in recent weeks — depending on the war situation and the state of negotiations between the Danube Monarchy and Italy; here the close interrelations between the negotiations with Italy and the situation in the Balkans were clearly visible. The initial successes of the Carpathian offensive had urged caution in Romania, as did the threat from the German envoy, Baron v. dem Busche, that Romanians would encounter German troops if they invaded Transylvania. By mid-February, the German envoy could even report that King Ferdinand had admitted the improvement of the situation, albeit with the addition that the conditions were not yet ripe for Romania to join.\n",
      "Just as in Romania, the mood in Bulgaria and Greece was calm at this time. This began to change in the second half of February when the decisive successes of the Central Powers expected on the eastern front failed to materialize and the attacks of the Anglo-French fleet against the Dardanelles began. The exaggerated reports of Entente successes caused understandable agitation among the Balkan states. One could not overlook that Bulgaria, if it lost faith in the victory of the Central Powers, might seek to join the Entente to avoid being left out at the peace settlement. In Greece, political agitation had reached its peak. The transition of Greece to the Entente camp became increasingly likely despite the king's serious attempts to maintain neutrality.</body>\n",

Falkenhayn, however, declared himself ready to provide further forces for the Austro-Hungarian front at the present moment.\n",

The serious representations of the German envoy, Baron v. dem Busche, accompanied by veiled threats, did not achieve their goal. The Romanian Prime Minister insisted that it was impossible to meet the wishes of the Central Powers, considering the Entente and public sentiment. The German envoy gained the impression that too much pressure would have the opposite effect and might drive Romania into the Entente camp under certain circumstances.\n",
      "Thus, the route through Romania for German munitions deliveries to Turkey remained temporarily blocked. This posed a serious threat to the defense on the Dardanelles front.

An attempt at the end of March by the Field Marshal Freiherr v. der Goltz, traveling through Sofia to the German Great Headquarters, to change the king's mind failed; he was not received at all. The Field Marshal, who continued his journey via Bucharest, had to note that the mood in Romania had also significantly worsened compared to his first visit in mid-December 1914. However, in Teschen, on March 29, he succeeded in convincing General v. Conrad of the necessity of the prompt execution of the Serbian campaign. He also offered support through two Turkish corps. Under certain reservations and conditions, the Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff was now ready for the operation against Serbia. Above all, Bulgaria must commit to participation, with Turkey covering its back and even actively participating in parts. General v. Conrad now established his view to General v. Falkenhayn that he considered a joint operation against Serbia feasible under the following military conditions: \"Bulgaria mobilizes and assembles its main forces for an advance over Niš, with parts over Zaječar; as soon as it begins this, but not earlier, we will launch the offensive, supported by about four German divisions, which would not be taken from the German forces currently used against Russia, and which must be in place by then. Turkey protects Bulgaria against Greece and Romania, should they intervene hostilely, and participates directly with about two corps under Bulgarian command as far as possible. I have communicated this idea to our Minister of Foreign Affairs.\"\n",
      "General v. Falkenhayn replied on March 30 that a final decision by Bulgaria had not yet been made. Meanwhile, preparations for the planned operation must be undertaken. Of importance was especially the question of the equipment of the German troops and the decision on the leadership of the command, for which a Turkish general might be considered, taking into account the German relations with Turkey and Bulgaria. General v. Falkenhayn generally agreed to the conditions set by General v. Conrad for the joint operation. He had already made similar proposals to Bulgaria some time ago. In his response, General v. Conrad spoke out decisively against a German command on the Balkans.</body>\n",

      "<body>Since the political prerequisites for the operation against Serbia, the agreement with Italy, and Bulgaria's participation were not yet secured, further discussions about the Serbian campaign initially led to no tangible result, despite the mobile efforts of Field Marshal Baron v. der Goltz during his stay at the German Great Headquarters in early April. He notes in his diary entries: “To Falkenhayn around 10½, long conversation about the situation. He claims to be entirely of my opinion. He has heard it from many people, but no one could tell him where to get the forces. The Austrians barely held the Carpathians with our help. Everything is fixed, even in France. The attack of the new English army is now expected. Behind our flanks, six divisions must be assembled. These (Serbs) are 200,000 men strong. We must muster 250,000 men, equal to ten divisions, to achieve the necessary superiority. That is impossible... Falkenhayn claims to have been working on the convention (with Bulgaria) for six weeks... Bulgaria, however, is showing reluctance. Everyone advises intervention in Serbia, but no one knows new means to execute it. I replied that the accusation did not apply to me, as I would bring the help of conditions and good Turkish corps. General v. Falkenhayn acknowledges this, but initially does not fully commit to my proposal.”\n",
      "Upon leaving the Great Headquarters on April 3, Field Marshal Baron v. der Goltz could only take a letter from the Kaiser to the Sultan as a visible sign of his efforts, promising the Serbian campaign in the \"near future.\" However, he was rightly convinced that he had found full understanding for his view of the Balkan situation with General v. Falkenhayn and had promoted his decision to implement the Serbian campaign as soon as the overall situation would allow. Just a few days after the departure of the Field Marshal from the Great Headquarters, General v. Falkenhayn had a written commitment from April 12 in hand, \"to make two army corps available for a joint operation against Serbia under the Bulgarian army.\" In a subsequent exchange of telegrams, General v. Falkenhayn finally assured, after initial hesitation, that by the end of May, it would be possible for the Serbian campaign, provided that clarity about Bulgaria's participation was achieved by then.</body>\n",

This decision meant indefinitely foregoing the major offensive in the West as well as against Serbia, for which preparations had already been made to a large extent.

For the third time in a few months, the situation in the East had vividly demonstrated to the German Chief of the General Staff that without the prior complete subjugation of the eastern enemy, a decision in the West and thus the victorious conclusion of the multi-front war was unattainable.

The task of diplomacy was to \"prolong the negotiations as long as possible and under no circumstances allow a war with Italy during this time.\" In the subsequent negotiations between Vienna and Rome, the German Chancellor, effectively supported by simultaneous representations from General v. Falkenhayn to the Austro-Hungarian military leadership, repeatedly pushed for extensive concessions to Italy's demands. The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, however, demanded that General v. Conrad clarify the extent of German military aid in the event of Italy's entry into the war. In the ensuing exchange of ideas between the two chiefs of staff, General v. Falkenhayn again avoided a specific answer; \"the question of the extent of German assistance in the event of an Italian attack could only be answered in a concrete case.\" At the discussion in Berlin on April 24, in which, as mentioned, besides the two chiefs of staff, the leading political figures also participated, an attempt was made to clarify the existing disagreements, but only agreement was reached that Italy's entry into the war would lead to Romania's entry; this meant the loss of the war. Nevertheless, Baron Burian was only willing to make concessions regarding Albania and Trentino, and at most the area around Shkodra, to the Italian demands. The question he raised again about Germany's military measures in the event of Italy's entry into the war was again described by General v. Falkenhayn as \"premature\"; it could only be answered after the ongoing operations in Galicia.\n",
      "The question of the Serbian campaign was also the subject of negotiations; the two chiefs of staff agreed that the most favorable time for its execution would be around the end of May, as by then the effects of the operations in Galicia would be clear and there would be enough time for negotiations about Bulgaria's and Turkey's involvement.

As General Danilov explained in a telegram to the Northwestern Front on April 12, they had received reports suggesting that some infantry and three cavalry divisions of the German army were in transit. It was considered likely that the Germans were bringing in strong forces to counter the Russian Carpathian offensive and had \"indications of the likelihood of a German attack against the center of the 3rd Army with the aim of hitting the right flank of the Russian troops that have advanced over the Carpathian ridge.\" The already ordered withdrawal of a corps, meant to be the III Caucasian, from the Northwestern Front was therefore all the more urgent. Furthermore, the Grand Duke again approached General Joffre regarding the constant redeployment of German troops from the French to the Russian front. Since the beginning of the war, not counting second-line troops, 14 infantry and 6 cavalry divisions had been moved from the west to the east, and recently again three cavalry divisions. There were also indications of the transport of additional forces. The Grand Duke requested that further such redeployments be prevented as much as possible so that they could \"settle with the Austrians.\"\n",
      "On April 17, however, there were also disturbing reports at headquarters about 7 or 8 German troop concentrations on the East Prussian front. One corps and three cavalry divisions were to be stationed at Marjampol, with five corps behind them at Insterburg–Königsberg.</body>\n",

During the planned nightly fire pauses, patrols advanced to make the necessary determinations before the assault. Pioneers created gaps in the enemy obstacles. During the disruptive fire, the assault troops moved up to and just behind the assault positions. Field batteries or individual guns, tasked with accompanying the attack or dealing with enemy supply movements occurring during the assault from close range, were brought forward with the help of the infantry into the most secure positions. When the mutual artillery fire ceased at 4 a.m., the setup of the assault front for the storm was completed.</body>\n",

As enemy counteraction was almost entirely absent, all telephone connections remained usable, ensuring close cooperation between artillery and infantry. The overwhelming effect of the assault artillery soon became apparent. From 9 o'clock in the morning, the mortars bombarded the breach points to prepare them for assault. At 9:45, the long-range flat fire began to flank the enemy positions. Precisely on the second, at 10 o'clock, the infantry rose to the assault along the entire front, while the artillery shifted its fire forward.\n",
      "In the K n e u ß l C o r p s, the infantry of the 11th B a v a r i a n I n f a n t r y D i v i s i o n, under the leadership of Major General Ritter Karl v. Schoch, had steep heights to climb. Therefore, it was not possible everywhere to reach the foremost enemy positions simultaneously with the advance of the artillery fire. From the high-lying trenches, the defensive fire revived and forced the attacking lines down the slopes. Once again, the artillery had to target the Russian positions. The main task of the division was to wrest the core of the enemy mountain front, the Zamczysko Massif, from the enemy. While the heavily affected regiment on the right and left flanks managed to advance into the first trenches in the first leap, the further attack of the entire regimental front against the terraced, defended trenches up to the forward summit of Zamczysko, height 507, proved extremely difficult and costly. A third of the attackers fell on the battlefield. By 11 o'clock, the summit was taken after fierce fighting. Soon after, the heavily fortified position south of the Mecina Valley at height 469 also succumbed to the repeated assaults of the Bavarian infantry despite heavy losses. The pursuit initiated through the rugged forest mountains was temporarily halted by a flank attack from the Russians from Naphta Br. Shortly after 2 o'clock in the afternoon, however, the intervention of the attackers overcame the danger of a setback here. The initially held-back right flank of the division also succeeded in gaining ground from Ropica Rusz. over and beyond height 501. This forced the enemy to retreat from his combat section in front of the center of the division. Thus, the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division had captured the most important high points in and behind the enemy mountain position on the eastern bank of the Selowka stream within a few hours.</body>\n",

Captured prisoners reported that Gorlice was heavily fortified. Therefore, the commander of the 82nd Reserve Division, Major General Fabarius, decided on another thorough bombardment of the city, especially the western edge, before entering the urban area. Under the impact of this massive fire, the combat strength and resistance of the defender collapsed. Large masses rushed out of the burning city, unarmed and with white flags, to surrender. Considerable ammunition and weapon depots fell into the hands of the victors.\n",
      "In the attack section of the 81st Reserve Division, which was largely wooded and therefore not as visible to the artillery, the artillery's storm preparation was insufficient, and the attackers were met everywhere with unbroken strong infantry and machine gun fire. Intense flanking fire was also coming from the Russian batteries in the forest around height 335 and from the left. Heavy losses occurred. The weak center and the left attack wing initially stalled after minor initial successes. Only the right wing managed to make progress against the forest height 335, in conjunction with the neighboring division. After new artillery preparation had taken effect, and infantry support batteries had fought the forest edges and enemy flanking positions from close range, the assault line of the left wing broke into the forest area south of Kamieniec. Here, too, large numbers of Russians were captured. The weak center of the division initially held firm opposite Mzanta. The division commander, Major General v. Stöcken, had his reserves follow into the Kamieniec forest to roll up the enemy front more strongly from the south. The enemy's resistance gradually decreased in their positions at Mzanta. They began to retreat to the heights located to the east.\n",

The inner flanks of the 106th and the subsequently adjoining 3rd Infantry Division of the XIV Corps had also broken into the enemy positions in the early morning hours at and south of Height Wal. The 8th Division gained ground on the main road to Tarnow by 9 a.m.\n",
      "These initial partial successes achieved during the night and early morning were followed by a general assault in coordination with the 11th Army.

On the morning of May 2, only the bridgehead position and the crossings were initially taken under artillery fire. It was not until the evening that the division commander decided to throw weaker forces from the Stoeger-Steiner group across the river at Glow. The execution was postponed until the night. On the northern flank of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, the Stoeger-Steiner group had already begun the crossing over the Dunajec at Sietzroze and Wyspa the previous night, surprising the enemy. During the day, they expanded their bridgehead there. Further advance was initially refrained from due to strong enemy presence in the front and left flank.\n",
      "On the southern flank of the battlefield, with the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, by 8 a.m. the X Army Corps had already succeeded in wresting the stronghold on the northern ridge northeast of Malastow from the enemy. The 11th Infantry Division then participated in an outstanding manner in the battles of the right wing of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division and maintained its position during the further course of the attack in the forested mountains on both sides of the Dragaszow Valley at the same height as the German neighbor. By midnight, they reached the heights of 657 and 522 on both sides of the Przegomina Valley. The 45th Infantry Division, which was adjacent to the south, fought its way up the ridge east of Malastow in fierce battles until the afternoon, while the 2nd Infantry Division captured the height south of Petna.

The divisions then began their pursuit at 6 a.m. They encountered no significant resistance. A Russian column was observed retreating from Bugaj to Rozembark. According to other reports, the enemy was also expected to abandon their further eastern positions. The commanding general, Field Marshal Lieutenant v. Arz, therefore believed that his corps could set a very distant goal, the Olszynta, which was agreed upon by the army command and the general command of the neighboring guard corps. By midday, the pursuing Austro-Hungarian infantry was already approaching the line Dzial Krzemienny (371)—Rozembark.\n",
      "General Freiherr v. Plettenberg had also anticipated the further retreat of the enemy on May 3rd and ordered the continuation of the pursuit for the guard corps at 6 a.m. They advanced briskly in the morning. The commanding general therefore believed by 11 a.m. that it would also be possible for his corps to reach the Olszynta today. A counterattack by the enemy from the Lipie Heights (425) against the middle of the 2nd Guard Infantry Division failed. However, the enemy seemed determined to offer stubborn resistance here. The division received the order at noon to attack the Lipie Heights. In the 1st Guard Infantry Division, the 1st Guard Infantry Brigade, deployed in the front line, attacked the high ground west of the Olszynta section Olszyny—W. H. Todlowka Tuchowka around midday.\n",
      "The 11th Army Command concluded from the favorable news and reports received during the morning that there was hardly any expectation of uniform resistance from the enemy in one of the prepared rear positions. By midday, the pursuit columns of the army corps had often reached the goals designated in the army order for May 3rd. Thus, Generaloberst v. Mackensen believed he could significantly expand the day's tasks. At 12 p.m., the following army order was issued:\n",

      "Despite the not entirely satisfactory progress that the pursuit seemed to have made on the afternoon of May 3, Generaloberst v. Mackensen steadfastly adhered to the goal he had set. In his army order issued at 6 p.m., he described it as the task for the following day to \"keep the enemy in retreat and, if possible, force the crossing of the Wisloka before new enemy forces are deployed.\" It was known that the imminent intervention of the III Caucasian Army Corps, advancing from the area south of Przemysl, was expected. The commander-in-chief therefore moved his army troops to the right against the line Zmigrod—Wisloka bend south of Kolaczice. The begun right envelopment of the 11th Army was to be continued simultaneously.\n",
      "In front of the Emmich Corps, the enemy had evacuated his positions at Wapienne and north of Bednarka during the night. Early in the morning, aircraft had detected the departure of enemy columns from Krempna towards Zmigrod. The enemy thus apparently withdrew parts of his Carpathian front under the flank pressure exerted by the Emmich Corps. Therefore, General v. Emmich decided to employ the fresh 20th Infantry Division to quickly seize the Wisloka crossing at Zmigrod and block the valley road there. The 11th Bavarian Infantry Division was to clear the way for this new deployment by advancing through Bodringen to the Wisloka; the 119th Infantry Division secured the northeast. The army command ordered the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army to also advance with its left wing against the upper Wisloka. Against the advance of the Emmich Corps, the enemy apparently brought fresh forces from Dembowiec to the southwest. The 11th Bavarian Infantry Division, following the road from Bednarka, encountered the enemy in a strong position at Wola Cieklińska around noon. In the afternoon, a heavy frontal battle developed here.</body>\n",

The breach in the Russian front achieved on May 2nd was now expanded at this point to a full breakthrough.

The division was to be followed up as soon as the XXXXI Reserve Corps could take over flank protection. General v. Francois had his corps advance as early as 4 a.m. to relieve the Emmich Corps of concern for its left flank as soon as possible. However, in the forested mountains, the advance, particularly the artillery, encountered significant route difficulties. Thus, the 82nd Reserve Division could only connect with the 119th Infantry Division in the morning and continue the attack against Dobicina. The 81st Reserve Division made no progress at Harlkow. The Austro-Hungarian VI Corps sought to connect with this division south of the Ropa, while north of the Ropa it encountered an enemy position between the river and Baczal Dl.

According to troop observations and other reports, the Russian units retreating before the 11th Army were in severe disarray and increasing dissolution. Even the smallest units faced vastly superior enemy forces. Russian artillery was hardly present anymore. However, the sacrificial perseverance of the rearguards had enabled the enemy to save the bulk of the defeated army from the pursuer, even before the 11th and Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. Extensive destruction of railway and road structures, effective demolition of the hard surface of the few paved roads over long distances, and the burning of countless villages along the retreat routes showed the now also here commencing systematic nature of the retreat. The difficulties and march separations for the pursuit columns had thereby increasingly grown. Disruptions in the supply of food and ammunition were already noticeably hindering them.</body>\n",

The decision was made for the final solution, which had already been initiated by the orders of the 11th Army on May 10. Accordingly, new fundamental instructions were issued by the Austro-Hungarian military command on the morning of the 11th. \"The next goal is to force the San downstream to Przemysl and to be ready for further advance on the eastern bank of the San.\" The 11th Army remained positioned on the southern stretch on both sides of Jaroslaw, covered on the left flank by the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. The Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army was to advance south of the San with its northern wing against the west and south front of Przemysl and take the fortress by storm if possible. Its right wing was positioned on Mosciska (25 kilometers south of Przemysl), the left wing on the adjoining Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army on Stary Sambor. Strong forces of this army were to be kept ready to advance eastwards south of the Dniester if necessary.

Emmich was to take command of the 19th Infantry Division on the left wing with the General Command of the X Army Corps and subsequently also take over the 20th and 56th Infantry Divisions upon their arrival. This reinforcement of the northern wing seemed necessary, as strong flank attacks from the San-Vistula angle had to be expected during further advances. In this reorganization, the army corps were to reach the line Krzywcza—Pruchnik—Sosnica on May 13 and push forward beyond Boratyn for reconnaissance and finally obvious reconnaissance up to the enemy. The 56th Infantry Division was to reach Lancut, the 20th Infantry Division was to reach Trzyncz marching north, and the 119th Infantry Division was to remain as army reserve at Dubiecko on the San.</body>\n",

      "But various material difficulties, which had already become more and more noticeable for days, now grew into a serious hindrance for the further advance of the armies to the east. The experience confirmed that the supply of ammunition and provisions encountered significant difficulties as soon as one moved far from the railway. Thorough destructions further increased the difficulties already posed by the terrain alone. Systematic destruction of accommodations and local supplies by the Russians forced the troops to rely extensively on resupplied provisions. A distance of over 150 kilometers from the railway points had to be overcome by horse-drawn columns, as the load-bearing capacity of the bridges and the condition of the roads did not allow or severely hindered the use of suitable truck columns. For days, reports from individual units had been saying that the regular provisioning of the troops was no longer feasible. The performance capacity of the horses was exhausted due to the lack of fodder. General v. Falkenhayn also pointed out to the 11th Army before reaching the San that in this situation the supply issue had to be clarified before further advance.

However, the Supreme Army Command ordered most emphatically that the Wisloka should be regarded as the utmost limit for the backward movement. In a meeting held in Cholm on the morning of May 7 with the army group commanders, the Grand Duke emphasized once again that he did not allow any further retreat to the east in Galicia, especially a retreat of the 3rd Army behind the San.

The retreat of Radko Dmitrijew was carried out in exemplary order, he will probably hold at the San. Dragomirov is to blame for everything. Our losses in personnel are enormous, they are said to reach 150,000. The X Corps and the III Caucasian Corps are almost destroyed, yet there were no cases of panic and weak surrender.

      "The Grand Duke had already stated the day before in a communication to General Joffre and Lord Kitchener, clarifying the situation: The losses of the 3rd Army are very large, but it is hoped to hold the San line. In view of the significantly reduced German forces on the Western Front, the support of the allied armies would be expressed in a vigorous and uninterrupted offensive. Since the beginning of the war, the number of German infantry divisions in the East has grown from nine to 38, perhaps even to 42, and the cavalry divisions from one to nine or ten, but not a single German unit deployed on the Russian front has been transferred to the Western Front thanks to the efforts of the Russians, the Grand Duke considered it very desirable that in the future the transfer of German troops to the Russian front would be made impossible. Furthermore, the accelerated entry of Italy into the war would be desirable and the fastest possible dispatch of artillery shells and rifle cartridges absolutely necessary.</body>\n",

      "<body>The German Supreme Army Command was not decisively involved in the operations on the Eastern Front in the winter of 1915. The continuation of the 9th Army's offensive north of the Pilica, demanded by General v. Falkenhayn, was even replaced by the operation on the Carpathian Front without his consent, following direct agreements between General v. Conrad and the Eastern Commander-in-Chief. He had no choice but to retroactively agree to the transfer of significant German forces to the allied army. He had no influence on the conduct of this operation. His proposal to deploy the German Southern Army at the Uszok Pass and west of it was disregarded. After his initial concerns about this operation proved to be correct, he attempted to persuade the allied Chief of Staff to halt the Carpathian Offensive. This, too, was unsuccessful. His assistance was only sought to the extent that he was asked to release new forces. Within the limits of possibility, he endeavored to comply with these requests.\n",
      "Similarly limited was the influence General v. Falkenhayn had during the winter months on the operations in the area of the Eastern Commander-in-Chief. Here, too, his activity was initially limited to providing the forces deemed necessary for the offensive in East Prussia — admittedly, according to his own admission, only \"with a heavy heart\" — and agreeing to the operational intentions and measures reported by Field Marshal v. Hindenburg. The original desire to take over the leadership of these operations himself was quickly abandoned by the German Chief of Staff, and he refrained from any intervention during their course. Even after the operations there concluded with victory in the Winter Battle in Masuria, he was content with the general objective set for the Eastern Commander-in-Chief, considering the military and political overall situation, to bring the Russian armies into such a position by the second half of March at the latest, that they would not be able to pose a threat to us in the foreseeable future.\n",

      "<body>Here, General v. Falkenhayn emerged from his previously reluctant reserve as an active and decisive personality. This was already evident in the considerations that preceded the decision to deploy strong German forces on the Eastern Front in the second half of March. It was quite understandable that the German Chief of Staff also embraced this idea with a heavy heart, as its execution meant that all hopes and wishes for the early resumption of a decisive offensive on the Western Front had to be postponed indefinitely. Nevertheless, he already then, with a cool sense of reality, sharply focused on the inherently undesirable and inconvenient possibility that the constantly growing plight of the ally on the Carpathian Front might force him to such a measure. Thus, the suggestion transmitted by General v. Cramon at the beginning of April from the Austro-Hungarian Chief of Staff to send four divisions to West Galicia, \"to halt the Russian advance,\" fell on already prepared ground. General v. Falkenhayn still internally resisted the events without freedom of decision, only being completely clear from the outset that if the plight should urge him to act, he would have to deploy stronger forces. While General v. Conrad's proposal only aimed at a local offensive to halt the further advance of the Russians in the Carpathians, General v. Falkenhayn had from the outset the larger, albeit initially operationally limited, goal in mind, \"to force the Russians to evacuate their front in West Galicia up to the height of the Lupkower Pass.\" He steadfastly adhered to this goal when the plight arose and rejected new, inevitably proposed suggestions from the allied Chief of Staff, which suddenly amounted to nothing less than a double-encompassing offensive operation of the greatest style on the Eastern Front. General v. Falkenhayn deserves credit for clearly recognizing the limits of what was possible and achievable.\n",
      "Much easier than this fundamental decision to deploy new strong forces in the East was answering the question of where and how the set goal should be pursued. The German Chief of Staff quickly reached a conclusion on this matter in a thorough exchange of views with his Austro-Hungarian advisors, fully appreciating the suggestions made by General v. Cramon, which were based on the initial suggestion of General v. Conrad.</body>\n",

Apparently, he wanted to keep open the possibility of using these reinforcements elsewhere. He considered it all the more necessary to bring in all the forces of the allied armed forces released from the Carpathian front to increase the striking power in West Galicia, regardless of a setback on secondary fronts, as was now threatening to occur in Bukovina. The contradiction in which General v. Conrad found himself with the view of the German Chief of General Staff did not have any adverse effects on the execution of the pursuit operation up to the San. However, whether it would influence the future development of the military situation in Galicia was a question for the future.</body>\n",

Nevertheless, it must be expected that the enemy will succeed in breaking through in places. Therefore, rear positions should be expanded. \"Under no circumstances is it intended to occupy the expanded rear position to a large extent, but only at the purely local point where a breakthrough by the enemy succeeded. The connection from this small part of the rear position to the front, not taken by the enemy, should be immediately established in the given case, so that only a bulge in the front line arises.\" The interpretation that this was the first step towards initiating voluntary withdrawal from larger parts of the army front was countered: \"Should it ever be operationally necessary\n",

Conrad had based his Carpathian enterprise on, and the hopes attached to them, with internal reservations. These were mostly rooted in the difficulties of conducting warfare in mountainous terrain. The limited progress, sometimes even interrupted by worrying failures, seemed to justify the doubts of the German General Staff Chief. On February 8, General v. Conrad noted that the goal of bringing about a significant turnaround there \"seemed temporarily unattainable, although it was still hoped for later, relying on the capabilities of the Austro-Hungarian army.\" However, General v. Conrad viewed the situation more favorably at this point. He only expected a \"full and rapid success of the operations\" from the new deployment of reinforcements with the German Southern Army, as requested by General v. Linsingen on February 10. In a telegram to General v. Falkenhayn on February 11, it stated: \"We are continuously transporting all forces that can be spared elsewhere to the Carpathians.\" At the same time, he urgently requested consideration of whether a German division could be freed up somewhere and quickly brought to the Southern Army. General v. Falkenhayn was willing to comply with this request and initially asked the Eastern Commander on February 13 to distribute an infantry division of the 9th Army along a self-chosen railway line so that its transport could be carried out at any time.\n",

The complete exhaustion of the 3rd Army's troops made it impossible to counter the Russians' intentions with their own attack, as repeatedly demanded by the 2nd Army's high command. The following days shook the entire structure of the 2nd Army's defensive front. Already on the night of March 23, the important height of Stoly north of Kalnica was taken from their left flank. The right flank of the 3rd Army also had to be supported; both the Szurmay group and the 4th Army sent additional forces there. However, they were unable to prevent new setbacks. In fierce battles on the night of March 24, the eastern flank of the 3rd Army was thrown down from the Beskid Ridge, and in the following night, their left flank was also breached and withdrawn to a new position on both sides of Iwonic.

      "After the clash of the 8th and 10th Armies at Augustow, a new situation had arisen, which the Commander-in-Chief East had already recognized a few days earlier1). With a firm hand, he intervened to disentangle the troop concentration at Augustow and assign new tasks to the armies according to the changed circumstances. The prerequisite for carrying out this new operation was the conclusion of the battles with the Russian 10th Army in the large forest area, whose successful outcome the Commander-in-Chief East could now hardly doubt, as the reorganization of the forest terrain was making ever further progress.\n",
      "The focus of the 8th Army had now shifted; from the ever-lengthening flank at Narew and Bobr, a new front had emerged. East of the Vistula, two new hotspots had emerged north of Lomza and near Przasnysz. The German artillery deployment was taking place in front of Ojcowice. The swampy terrain, as in the autumn of 1914, posed the greatest difficulties for the infantry's advance.\n",
      "The situation at Lomza caused serious concern. Caucasian and Guard troops had been newly identified there. It had become known from Russian radio messages that two Russian armies had been formed on the Bobr—Narew front: on the right flank the 12th Army, with its headquarters in Ostrow, with three corps, and on the lower Narew the 1st Army, also with three corps and a cavalry corps; its headquarters was in Jablonna.

      "After the last major final battle at Wolfusz, the German 10th Army now faced the new task of forcing the crossing over the Bobr lowlands between Ossowiec and Grodno under cover to strike the enemy's Bobr—Narew front from the rear. This required regrouping and thus time. The heavy fighting and efforts of the winter battle had taken the mental and physical strength of the troops to the extreme limit. Nevertheless, rest and recovery were not yet possible; for the enemy, who was strengthening daily, proceeded to counterattacks along the entire front.\n",
      "Generaloberst v. Eichhorn faced a very difficult task. The ice cover of the Bobr still held, but the thawing of the last few days had softened the swamps again. The smaller Bobr arms could not be kept open, but in any case, it was necessary to overcome an exposed, many kilometers wide lowland in view of the enemy. Moreover, the task was hardly solvable with the Grodno fortress in flank and rear. The command of the 10th Army had not yet abandoned the intention to attack Grodno. The Commander-in-Chief East, however, seemed to assess the situation differently in view of the events at the Narew. He did not give permission for the attack on Grodno, for which the 77th Reserve Division was intended. The further development of the situation then forced the plans regarding the Niemen fortresses to recede.\n",

Attacked by the vastly superior forces of the I Siberian Corps, the 36th Reserve Division had to retreat about two kilometers. From the east, the Russians advanced with the II Siberian Corps over the Orzyc. General Freiherr v. Gagern, with his Landwehr, who had fought so brilliantly in the winter battle a few days earlier, was unable to withstand this attack with stronger forces. Without much effort, the Russians threw back the 9th Landwehr Brigade north of the Przasnysz—Krasnosielc road. At Dembning, the 6th Infantry Brigade managed to intercept the Russian thrust, but south of there, the Russians advanced to the Wengierka. The situation had become serious. Danger threatened especially from the northeast. In the evening, all German troops from the Division Wernitz, including up to the Orzyc, were placed under General v. Morgen's command. He ordered the 36th Reserve and 3rd Infantry Divisions to defend against the south and east on February 26, while the 1st Reserve Division was moved far north to strike the northern Russian flank with a thrust to the southeast. However, on February 26, heavy fighting occurred only on the southern front, but it did not bring any decisive change in the situation. General v. Gallwitz now believed he had to expect a major Russian attack against the army detachments. According to reliable observations, troops were unloaded at Ostrow and on the railway line to the south.

The continuation of the attack initially from the east against the Bobr—Narew position was the second task, which the Eastern Commander-in-Chief continued to pursue. He relocated his headquarters to Lötzen on February 22.\n",
      "However, the events of the following days were not suitable to strengthen the hope for a successful continuation of the operation. All incoming reports, including valuable aerial reports, indicated a strong influx of Russian reinforcements to the Niemen—Narew front. The enemy seemed to focus on the Lomza—Przasnysz section. German reinforcements had to be directed there. For the operational wing at Grodno, the available forces were no longer available. The intense attacks threatening from Bobr and Narew gradually deprived the Eastern Commander-in-Chief of the initiative despite his great victory.

Esebeck north of this river up to the Baltic Sea. According to reliable reports, the enemy had three corps between Sopoczkinie and Grodno, as well as at Grodno, two cavalry divisions at Olita, and one corps at Kowno. According to unconfirmed civilian reports, stronger forces were supposed to gather at Olita for an attack. On March 1, the army command informed the subordinate command authorities that the army would soon be withdrawn to the line Augustow–Krasnopol–Lodzajcie.

Falkenhayn at the Great Headquarters about the attack plan so clearly and definitively that, according to his own statement<sup>2)</sup>, everything seemed \"quite self-evident\" to him. The written instructions handed to him for the 11th Army corresponded to the agreements made in Berlin between Generals v. Falkenhayn and v. Conrad. A meeting that Colonel v. Seeckt had on April 19, following his report at the headquarters in Teichen with General v. Conrad, also showed complete agreement on the planned operation. Colonel v. Seeckt received some documents for use in the preparations for the breakthrough battle. However, they only contained the depiction of attacks of small and smallest scale in the area of Gorlice. Any operational preparations for the upcoming breakthrough offensive of the 11th Army had not yet been made by the Austro-Hungarian military leadership<sup>3)</sup>.\n",
      "The necessary instructions to the German military railway authorities were issued on April 15. The following units were ready for transport as the forward echelon: the Guard Corps near Strasbourg in Alsace, the XXXI Reserve Corps at Busigny, the 119th Infantry Division at Möhringen, the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division at Lille. All these units had been given the opportunity, albeit for a short time, behind the Western Front to train for the attack against fortified positions and for breakthrough operations.

      "On the evening of May 1, at the onset of dusk, the artillery of the 11th Army opened strong disruptive fire. The counteraction of the Russian batteries was hardly noticeable. During the planned nightly fire pauses, patrols advanced to make the necessary determinations before the assault. Pioneers created gaps in the enemy obstacles. During the disruptive fire, the assault troops moved up to and just behind the assault positions. Field batteries or individual guns, tasked with accompanying the attack or dealing with enemy supply movements occurring during the assault from close range, were brought forward with the help of the infantry into the most secure positions. When the mutual artillery fire ceased at 4 a.m., the setup of the assault front for the storm was completed.\n",

Consequently, artillery fire intensified along the entire front north of the river, strong patrols advanced against the Russian positions, new trenches were dug close to the enemy, and saps were driven forward in many places to create the impression of an impending attack.\n",

After the High Command of the Southwestern Front had already been forced on the night of May 4 to 5 to order the withdrawal of the right wing of the 8th Army (XXIV and XII Corps) from the area of Mezölaborcz in an easterly direction, the Chief of General Staff, General Dragomirov, considered the overall situation on May 5 so serious that he proposed a general retreat behind the San. However, the Supreme Army Command ordered most emphatically that the Wisloka should be regarded as the utmost limit for the backward movement. In a meeting held in Cholm on the morning of May 7 with the army group commanders, the Grand Duke emphasized once again that he did not allow any further retreat to the east in Galicia, especially a retreat of the 3rd Army behind the San. Overall, he regarded the defeat of the 3rd Army up to that point only as a local setback, but he ordered the reinforcement of the Southwestern Front by the XV Corps from the Northwestern Front and the V Caucasian Corps from Odessa<sup>1</sup>. On the evening of May 7, he telegraphed Lord Kitchener and General Joffre, pointing out the failures of the last few days, to immediately begin the agreed offensive against the German Western Front.\n",
