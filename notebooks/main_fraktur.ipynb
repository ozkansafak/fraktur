      "- **Accuracy**: Capture all text elements exactly as they appear. Do **NOT** summarize or skip content, including index or table of contents pages.\n",
      "- **Paragraph Integrity**: Transcribe paragraphs as cohesive blocks. Do not add carriage returns (`\\n`) at the end of each line unless explicitly present.\n",

      "\n",
      "Task: Transcribe the entire text from the image into German, including all Fraktur characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions**:\n",
      "1. **Accuracy**: \n",
      "   - Faithfully transcribe all text elements **WITHOUT ANY SUMMARIZATION** even if the page consists of dense repetitive looking text. \n",
      "   - Don't repetitively extract the same letter or the same '.' character unlike in the original document.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Page Number Detection**:\n",
      "   - Identify the **current page number** written at the **very top or bottom** of the page being transcribed.\n",
      "   - Wrap only this number in `<pageno></pageno>` tags (e.g., `<pageno>13</pageno>` or `<pageno>XII</pageno>`).\n",
      "   - **Caution**:\n",
      "     - Numbers listed in a **Table of Contents** or an **Index** page should **never** be wrapped in `<pageno>` tags, as they refer to other pages in the book.\n",
      "     - There should be at most one `<pageno>` tag per page, (or none if no page number exists for the current page.)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Formatting**: Wrap the entire transcription in `<raw_german></raw_german>` tags.\n",

      "- **For a regular page with a page number**:\n",
      "  ```\n",

      "1. **Categorization**:\n",
      "   - **Header**: Wrap chapter titles or section headings in `<header></header>` tags.\n",
      "   - **Body**: Wrap the main text in `<body></body>` tags.\n",
      "   - **Footer**: Wrap footnotes in `<footer></footer>` tags. If no footer exists, omit this section.\n",
      "   - **Page Number**: Include the `<pageno>` tag at the start of the transcription if a page number was detected in Step 1.\n",
      "2. **Formatting**: Wrap the structured transcription in `<german></german>` tags.\n",
      "3. **Caution**:\n",
      "   - Do not summarize, skip, or alter the raw_german content. Your task is to **faithfully copy** the extracted text from Step 1 and assign the correct section tags.\n",

      "The previous practice of concluding the depiction of events on the various theaters of war at the same time had to be deviated from, as the operations in the East formed internally coherent actions until the end of the year, whose depiction could not be interrupted. This also results in the larger scope of the present volume. The review deals with the position of the German Supreme Army Command on the question of warfare in the East throughout the entire year of 1915.\n",
      "The inclusion of military formations has been omitted, as a special volume \"Military Formations\" as a supplement to the overall war work is in progress. The operational volumes will henceforth only provide brief information in footnotes about the respective troop divisions of the armies.\n",
      "The Historical Commission has entrusted Mr. Major General a.D. Rudolf von Borries in Potsdam and Dr. phil. Hans Rothfels, Professor of History at the University of Königsberg i. Pr., with the review of Volume VIII. The Reichsarchiv expresses its special thanks to both reporters.\n",
      "On October 31, 1931, the previous President of the Reichsarchiv, Dr. h.c. Hermann Ritter Mertz von Quirnheim, retired after reaching the age limit. He was succeeded by the Director of the Historical Department, Dr. h.c. Hans von Haeften. Oberarchivrat Wolfgang Foerster was appointed Director of the Historical Department.</body>\n",

This yielding coincided with the termination of the Triple Alliance treaty communicated to the Danube Monarchy by Italy on May 4. On May 5, the extraordinary German ambassador, Prince Bülow, reported from Rome that the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Baron Sonnino, had informed him after learning of the Vienna offers: Just 14 days ago, everything could have been settled with these proposals; to his remark that this was still possible today, Baron Sonnino remained silent. On May 6, the news arrived in Vienna that the Italian Council of Ministers had described the proposals of Austria-Hungary as \"not a sufficient basis for negotiation.\" Subsequently, Emperor Franz Joseph declared in a telegram to Emperor Wilhelm on the same day that he had reached \"the utmost limit of conceivable accommodation\" with the latest concessions.\n",
      "The seriousness of the Italian crisis prompted a discussion among the leading statesmen and general staff chiefs of the Central Powers on May 7 in Teschen. The latest news from Rome was somewhat more hopeful. It was said that Italy had indeed concluded a treaty with the Entente on April 26, but reserved a four-week period for decision on whether this treaty should also come into force. Thus, there still seemed to be a faint hope of keeping Italy out of the war.\n",
      "So far, General von Falkenhayn had evasively answered all inquiries from Austria-Hungary regarding German military assistance in the event of Italy's possible entry into the war; this possibility could only be decided in the \"concrete case.\" Determining for this stance was, apart from the military situation, which made any fragmentation of forces undesirable, above all the effort to induce the Danube Monarchy to remain as accommodating as possible towards Italy until the end.\n",

On the Eastern Front, there was hope, thanks to the great successes of the Galician operation, to soon make forces available; the Viennese government had indeed gone to the limits of what was possible in its concessions, perhaps even beyond. This explained why General von Falkenhayn, during the meeting in Teschen, was prepared to send German forces to the Italian border if necessary; however, their extent had to be made dependent on the general situation upon Italy's entry into the war.\n",
      "Regarding the political outcome of this discussion, Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg informed Prince Bülow in Rome on May 8 that the Viennese cabinet was ready to \"ultimately approve everything.\"\n",
      "Moreover, statements by the previously oppressive former Italian Prime Minister Giolitti about the seriousness of the situation finally prompted the Austro-Hungarian and the extraordinary German ambassador in Rome, without waiting for Vienna's consent, to inform the Italian Foreign Minister on May 10 of even further-reaching Austrian concessions. These included the cession of all territories inhabited by Italians in Tyrol and on the western Isonzo bank with Gradisca, furthermore, for Trieste, a declaration as an \"Imperial Free City\" and a free port, as well as the establishment of an Italian university, and finally, complete disinterest of Austria-Hungary in Albania. Germany declared itself ready to guarantee the loyal execution of these offers to the Italian government.\n",
      "Although these concessions went significantly beyond those previously made, indeed even beyond what Giolitti had suggested a few months earlier, the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, Baron Burian, subsequently declared his agreement to them to his own embassy in Rome. The question was merely whether the offers did not go too far, and whether the Italian government had not already committed itself too far to the Triple Alliance. Then everything depended on the internal political development in Italy, which still seemed to favor the Central Powers at the last moment; for on May 13, Prime Minister Salandra, due to strong resistance threatening him in the Italian parliament against the war policy, submitted his resignation. However, when it became known on the afternoon of May 16 that the King had not accepted Salandra's resignation, it was clear that the decision for war had been made.</body>\n",

      "<body>Although the increasingly significant military success of the Allies in Galicia seemed unable to change Italy's stance, there was hope that it could still positively influence the politically unstable situation in the Balkans. Above all, it was expected that Romania would adopt a more friendly attitude towards the Central Powers. Furthermore, there was renewed hope of finally winning over Bulgaria. The demand to secure a connection with Turkey by defeating Serbia became increasingly urgent due to the major landing operations of the British and French on the Gallipoli Peninsula, as raised by the Ottoman government. To secure Bulgaria's support against Serbia, both Chiefs of Staff agreed on May 12 in Pleß to inform Sofia that they were ready to immediately prepare the campaign against Serbia, given the favorable situation in Galicia and the current favorable water levels of the Danube; however, agreement on Bulgaria's military involvement was a prerequisite. The Bulgarian government was therefore informed by the German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, von Jagow, of the proposal to immediately send a high-ranking officer to conclude a military convention at the German Great Headquarters, where representatives of Austria-Hungary and Turkey were also invited. However, the response to this offer was delayed due to the threatening developments in Rome. In fact, Bulgaria wanted to make its decision dependent on clarifying the general situation.\n",
      "Meanwhile, General von Conrad proposed in a memorandum sent to Pleß on May 14 that if Italy's entry into the war became a reality, they should switch to defense in Galicia after reaching the Dniester-San line, but with the available forces — he calculated with ten Austro-Hungarian and ten German divisions — to attack the Italians; he believed that with sufficient German and Bulgarian forces involved, they could simultaneously conduct the campaign against Serbia. However, General von Falkenhayn could only agree to this proposal regarding the defense in Galicia, as he considered a military success in the Balkans necessary due to the Turks' precarious situation. He therefore planned to first attack Serbia and remain on the defensive against Italy in the meantime.</body>\n",

The attack against Serbia should be prepared immediately. Against Italy, Austria-Hungary should take over the cover in Carinthia, Carniola, and the coastal land with about 10 divisions. In Tyrol, General von Falkenhayn was ready to assign the same task to German troops. The Austro-Hungarian and Bavarian fortifications currently there should be placed under German command. To what extent German forces should be deployed in Tyrol could not yet be decided; in any case, efforts would be made to ensure that no advance of the Italians into Tyrolean land would occur.\n",
      "In his response the next day, General von Conrad maintained that only 20 divisions could be withdrawn as the Galician front; he intended to deploy these against the Italians in a concentrated manner to defeat their 30 divisions, which were expected to advance in the general direction over Villach and Laibach towards the Danube line Vienna—Budapest. However, he did not want to relinquish the defense of Tyrol; it would fall under Austro-Hungarian command in the event of an advance by unreliable German forces. The security against Serbia and, if necessary, against Romania was the responsibility of the Austro-Hungarian Balkan forces.\n",
      "In response to these statements, General von Falkenhayn repeated his operational proposal, but reduced the forces to be freed in Galicia to only 29 divisions. Including the Austro-Hungarian Balkan Army with 20 divisions, he believed he could use 49 divisions against Serbia and Italy. \"Regarding the question of how they are to be deployed,\" — he wrote on May 17, \"I do not want to address it until I have received Bulgaria's response\").</body>\n",
      "<footer>1) The assumption that Austria-Hungary had over 20 divisions on the Serbian border was explained by the fact that General von Falkenhayn had learned from a statement by General von Conrad that the Austro-Hungarian Balkan Army was only 240,000 men strong. He now counted these forces among the 20 divisions, mistakenly assuming that most of the units stationed on the Serbian border could also be used against Italy.

      "The forefront of all considerations was, as it emerged, that he also endeavored on May 19 to create the prerequisites for its implementation. Through the representative of the Foreign Office at the great headquarters, Envoy von Treutler, he demanded further diplomatic steps in Sofia to finally obtain a clear answer from there to the inquiry of May 12 about Bulgaria's participation. In a letter sent to Teschen on the same day, he emphasized: \"That the Serbian matter can be resolved by the sausage men of the Italian offensive, I consider certain. The Italians, according to all my information, will not march with their masses before the beginning of June and, according to Your Excellency's personal information, have at least four weeks to march and fight before they become truly threatening. So this is not the case before the beginning of July. By then, however, the Serbian question can very well be decided.\"\n",
      "Events then occurred that fundamentally influenced the decisions of the two chiefs of staff: On the evening of May 19, it became known through Teschen that Bulgaria had declined to participate in a campaign against Serbia; furthermore, the Austro-Hungarian army command was informed from Vienna that Italy's declaration of war was expected within 24 hours at the latest. General von Conrad then wrote to Pleß, convinced that \"we must now jointly face the new, certain enemy with all our might and must not paralyze this action by an enterprise based on the possible future intervention of an uncertain third party (Romania or Bulgaria).\"\n",
      "On the same day, May 19, reports of extraordinarily heavy Russian attacks on the 11th Army arrived at the German Great Headquarters. These made it seem advisable to General von Falkenhayn, in connection with Bulgaria's refusal, to temporarily leave the focus of warfare on the Russian front and to conduct the fight both against Serbia and against Italy initially defensively.\n",
      "He therefore sent an urgent request to Teschen on May 20, not to shift any further forces against Italy beyond the five divisions of the German 11th Army \"under any circumstances, which they are now doing in Poland and Galicia, but to prevent the Central Powers from creating new, severe suffering.\" The defense fronts are to begin when the goal, \"the final overthrow of the Russian offensive power in Galicia,\" is achieved.\n",

      "To gain clearer insight for future decisions, General von Falkenhayn on the same day requested information on how the Austro-Hungarian military leadership intended to conduct the strike against Italy in detail. He mentioned that, according to his estimate, \"the beginning of the decisive battles could hardly be expected before about seven weeks from today,\" specifically east of the line Graz—Marburg—Agram. The immediate response indicated that General von Conrad anticipated an Italian advance in two directions, over Laibach—Marburg towards the Danube line Budapest—Raab and over Villach—Leoben towards Vienna. He planned to comprehensively attack and defeat the right Italian flank, while the enemy's left flank would be held back by border guards and troops to be assembled in Carinthia. The attack was to be led by the 5th Army, initially assembled with five divisions west of Agram, with three divisions at Marburg. \"I expect,\" emphasized General von Conrad, \"the incursion of stronger Italian forces across the border immediately after the declaration of war, probably on May 23 or 24, and must reckon with the 200-kilometer stretch from the border to Marburg—Agram taking three, at most four weeks, so until about June 14, at the latest June 20... However, I am clear that the eight divisions are far too weak for the strike and that everything must be done to immediately follow them with additional forces. By June 20, with full utilization of the railways, about 20 divisions could be assembled in the area of Graz—Marburg and west of Agram, which seems to me the necessary minimum for the decisive battle...\"\n",
      "However, General von Falkenhayn could not agree with these considerations. Given the situation in Galicia, it was by no means certain that 20 divisions would be available for the strike against Italy planned by General von Conrad in the foreseeable future. Under these circumstances, he insisted on deploying the available forces at the border for defense and went to Teschen on the afternoon of May 21 for further discussions. In a detailed exchange, an agreement was reached. Both chiefs of staff now agreed that the operation in Galicia should be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible. Since it was not foreseeable when this would be the case, the planned dispatch of three divisions each to Marburg and to the Bosnian border was not in question.</body>\n",

If Germany now merely limited itself to breaking off diplomatic relations with Italy, this was due to the desire to maintain, if possible, the supply of raw materials across the Italian border, and especially to consider the relationship with Romania. The news from there did not currently suggest any immediate danger, but Prime Minister Bratianu had told the German envoy in Bucharest, Baron von dem Busche, as late as May 21, that maintaining neutrality would be easier for him if not Germany, but Italy declared war. As the Chancellor informed General von Falkenhayn on May 21, King Ferdinand had assured the German envoy most emphatically that Romania had made no agreements with Italy, \"so that Italy's actions would not result in Romania's entry.\" Although the situation was becoming difficult due to increasing pressure from the Entente, the King hoped to maintain neutrality. \"On the other hand, Bratianu seems,\" the Chancellor continued, \"to be conducting negotiations with Russia behind the King's back,\" which he abstracted. It was also said at Gegenhis Rifis, not to be misled. Our victories in the Carpathians have made a strong impression in Romania. This should initially rule out Romania's entry into the war, but this eventuality is by no means excluded for later. Beldimann3) considers joining \"us\" to be excluded as long as there is no internal ministerial crisis in Bucharest, for which there is currently no prospect. In any case, an action against Serbia would mean another guarantee that Romania remains calm.\" Thus, the situation in Bucharest seemed relaxed at the time.

However, it had to be assumed that the final outcome of the struggle depended not least on the unhindered influx of German war materials. However, General von Falkenhayn, based on reports available in Constantinople towards the end of May, gained the impression that the Ottoman Empire would be able to maintain the situation at the straits further on its own strength; thus, a delay in the offensive against Serbia could also be justified from the standpoint of the situation at the Dardanelles.\n",

The military administration had sought to address this extremely difficult situation by further implementing previously made measures1). Under the leadership of Major Koeth, who in the spring of 1915 succeeded Dr. Walter Rathenau, who resigned at his own request, at the head of the War Raw Materials Department of the Prussian War Ministry, the official management of war-essential raw materials was to be systematically expanded for a long duration of war. Based on previous experiences, the Raw Materials Department made a clear distinction between the needs of the army and the homeland and sought to increasingly limit the population's needs to the absolutely necessary level. Careful recording of domestic and occupied territories' stocks, systematic expansion of existing and development of new production sources, but above all, regulated distribution of raw material quantities according to the importance of demand were intended to meet the continuously increasing requirements for arming and equipping the army. As a substitute for missing natural raw materials, artificial substances often had to be used, for whose production German inventiveness and science earned great merits2).\n",
      "The nutrition of the army and the homeland also experienced further restrictions due to Italy's entry into the war. Some food and feedstuffs, which had been suitable for replacing other scarce nutrients in the homeland and had previously been imported from Italy, were now no longer available. The closure of the Italian border was felt all the more harshly as it had already become necessary in the winter of 1914/15 to place the most important foodstuffs under state control; above all, the central management of bread grain had reminded the public of the full seriousness of the situation and prompted measures that affected all sections of the population noticeably.\n",
      "The blockade of overseas supplies had also already led to a serious shortage of feedstuffs; consequently, large quantities of bread grain and potatoes were used for livestock feeding. Since feeding bans were not sufficient, the Reich government had to order pig slaughters on a large scale, which lasted until May. To prevent a potato shortage in the summer, which would have put the poorest segments of the population in distress, all available potatoes were purchased by a specially established Reich agency.</body>\n",

In addition, there was a serious shortage of sugar, which forced requisitions in favor of the army administration. As the oat shortage worsened, the 1915 harvest also had to be requisitioned. Finally, the sugar shortage led to the central distribution of raw sugar. Beyond that, however, it had to be expected that further interventions in the free economy would be necessary to ensure the supply of the army and the population. The supplies from the agricultural areas occupied by German troops have so far significantly facilitated the army's nutrition, and the initiated systematic cultivation of the enemy's fields promised further help for the army with the coming harvest, but could hardly relieve the homeland effectively.\n",
      "In the Danube Monarchy, too, food difficulties first arose in October 1914, which resulted in sparing the combat strength of the ally. Before the war, Austria and Hungary formed a customs unit, where Hungary's agricultural overproduction covered the missing quantities of essential food and fodder in Austria. However, during the war, Hungary's economic situation became more difficult. Therefore, when the Hungarian government began requisitioning grain, flour, and sugar at the beginning of 1915, while Austria's most important agricultural areas, Galicia and Bukovina, were lost as war zones, Austria was forced to take similar measures as Germany. In lengthy negotiations, attempts were made to continue receiving supplies of food from Hungary and to relieve the Austrian economy in supplying the joint army. Nevertheless, the prospects from Hungary became increasingly sparse. The food situation in Austria also remained a subject of constant serious concern.\n",
      "In view of this situation, it was a palpable blow to the entire economic life of the Central Powers when one of the few remaining import bridges was closed by Italy's entry into the war. This disadvantage weighed all the more heavily as the overall economic situation in Germany, especially due to the now almost ten-month-long blockade of shipping over the North Sea, had become extraordinarily difficult for four weeks.

While the German government readily agreed to the American government's proposal, it was rejected by the enemy powers. The reason for this became apparent in the months following the outbreak of the war, as England and France took comprehensive measures to blockade and starve Germany. They used, in particular, an arbitrary handling of the war contraband law in contradiction to the London Declaration, as well as an unprecedented extension of the right to search and seize neutral ships. A particular intensification of the measures aimed at isolating Germany was experienced through the British Admiralty's announcement on November 2, 1914, declaring the entire North Sea a war zone³). This severely crippled neutral trade with Germany.\n",
      "In view of the dangers this posed to the overall war effort of the Central Powers, the Chief of the German Admiralty Staff, Admiral von Pohl, submitted a proposal to the Chancellor on November 7 to impose a blockade by submarines over the British Isles and the northern and western coasts of France as a countermeasure⁴). The idea of using submarines for trade warfare had not been considered by the leading authorities of the German Navy before the war. However, already in the first months of the war and increasingly after the first submarine successes, the suggestion arose from the submarine front that the most effective way to use this weapon would be against enemy trade. From the beginning, the prevailing view was that it would not be possible for submarines, given the expected enemy surveillance on shipping routes, to observe the forms of cruiser warfare, i.e., with surfaced submarines, to stop enemy merchant ships and inspect their nationality and cargo.\n",

As a precondition for a trade war with submarines, the authorization to sink enemy merchant ships by torpedo shot from submerged submarines without warning was contested. A clear distinction between neutral and enemy ships, which was originally considered possible, was questioned when, at the end of January 1915, British merchant ships were officially advised to fly a neutral flag to deceive German submarines. However, the German Admiralty hoped to gradually overcome the difficulties by ensuring that neutral shipping would increasingly refrain from navigating the waters around England with the unrestricted conduct of the submarine war, which on the German side was probably intended solely as a countermeasure against the relocation of the special band and blockade attempt by England. The navy expected the main effect of the submarine trade war to be the deterrence of shipping. However, the idea of conducting the trade war in this way met with concerns from the Reich leadership, which feared complications with neutral powers, especially with the United States of America. In these disagreements, the Chief of the General Staff observed restraint. He contented himself with emphasizing the interest of land warfare in preventing enemy canal traffic. The exchange of views between the navy and the Reich leadership on the political and international legal issues associated with the submarine trade war dragged on until the end of January 1915. It was not until February 1 that the Chancellor, in a meeting attended by the Chief of the General Staff of the Army, declared himself ready to set aside his concerns and accede to the demands of the Chief of the Admiralty. On February 4, after a presentation by Admiral von Pohl, the Kaiser gave his approval to the submarine trade war. Through an announcement by the Chief of the Admiralty, the waters around Great Britain were declared a war zone as a \"countermeasure against the violations of international law aimed at obstructing German maritime traffic by England.\" The submarine trade war was launched with a number of front-line submarines. Objections from neutral powers, particularly the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, and the United States of America, against the blockade measures of the Entente and the German countermeasures initially remained largely ineffective.</body>\n",

They acted, with complete disregard for the rights and interests of neutral countries, primarily in the direction of intensified obstruction of German trade through the states neighboring Germany, Holland, and the Nordic countries. Germany was to be completely cut off from the world like a besieged fortress, not only to weaken its military but to fatally starve the entire population.\n",
      "Thus, the submarine trade war continued. On the occasion of the sinking of the English passenger steamer \"Lusitania\" on May 7, where a number of American citizens lost their lives, serious diplomatic disputes arose between Germany and the United States. The American government protested and demanded for the future that sinkings should only occur after prior stopping and searching of ships, observing all customary precautionary measures to ensure passenger safety. However, the German Admiralty believed it could not comply with this demand without questioning the effectiveness of submarines against the increasingly large number of armed enemy steamers.\n",

Due to the strained replacement situation, the desired expansion of these brigades into divisions had to be temporarily postponed, as did the establishment of additional units in the Western Army; for it was unavoidable to undertake new formations while the existing units did not reach their planned strengths due to a lack of replacements.\n",
      "In the Eastern Army, the 4th Guard Infantry Division was formed in early May 1915, mainly from parts of the Guard Reserve Corps, and at the end of the month, following the already mentioned establishment of the 101st, 103rd, and 105th Infantry Divisions, the 107th Infantry Division was established using the same procedure. In October 1915, they remained there in a similar manner, using existing command authorities and troop units, as well as some new formations, to establish the 108th and 109th Infantry Divisions.</body>\n",

By the end of 1915, the number of Landwehr divisions had increased to a total of 20. Alongside this, in the summer and autumn of 1915, there was a reorganization and expansion of a number of previously makeshift units, often named after their leaders. The Posen Corps was formed as the 83rd and 84th Infantry Divisions, the Jastrow Corps as the XVII Reserve Corps, whose two divisions Wernitz and Breugel became the 86th Infantry and 85th Landwehr Divisions, the Dichthut Corps as the 87th, the Menges Division as the 88th, and the Westenhagen Department as the 89th Infantry Division.\n",

In September 1915, General von Wild explained to the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army that the replacement supply for the army could only be maintained at the previous level for about another year; circumstances therefore compelled \"the greatest economy with the available human material,\" particularly \"in view of the consequences that could arise if the influx of replacements dried up before all war tasks were brought to a favorable conclusion.\" Army and troop leaders were repeatedly reminded by the army administration to measure their replacement claims only according to truly urgent needs and to limit their demands for new formations as much as possible.\n",
      "Through the unified regulation of replacement supply in their hands, the army administration, in close cooperation with the Supreme Army Command, was able to meet needs according to urgency. Accordingly, replacement bans were imposed over troop units that were sufficiently supplied, and eventually over entire army fronts for shorter or longer periods. The same purpose of the most economical replacement management was also served when infantry troops, since the summer of 1915, were generally no longer filled to their full planned wartime strength, but only up to a battalion strength reduced to 800 men in the west and 900 men in the east.\n",

It was certain that the major offensive in the East and the expected defensive battles in the West on both extensive theaters of war would bring with them an extremely increased consumption of munitions.\n",
      "In accordance with the demands of General von Falkenhayn, the military administration had been striving with increased emphasis since the spring of 1915 to gradually reduce the mass production of cast iron shells, whose inferiority did not allow the artillery to fully develop its capabilities, and to promote the production of more efficient pressed steel and cast steel shells. This transition initially posed great difficulties, as their production was more challenging than the manufacture of simple cast iron munitions. Thanks to the foresighted measures of the Ministry of War and the capabilities of the German industry, it was possible to overcome these difficulties quickly, so that the delivery of pressed steel and cast steel shells also increased rapidly. Meanwhile, their processing into new munitions and thus the production of munitions in general reached its limit in the available amounts of powder and explosives. Since March, the extensive expansions of the powder factories, initiated in a timely manner by the military administration, had gradually become effective, forming the production of powder, and then also the production of explosives, as the measure for all deliveries. The main difficulty was the lack of saltpeter and nitric acid. Although the production of artificial saltpeter had started in the spring of 1915 with larger deliveries, so that an immediate emergency did not occur. However, the performance of the new factories could only be gradually increased due to numerous obstacles.\n",
      "The regulation of munitions production was now carried out in such a way that, depending on the situation, the provisions for field artillery or foot artillery were increased or restricted, and weapons of one type of caliber were postponed in favor of the other. For infantry ammunition, due to the high artillery demand, powder production had to be relatively held back, while the subsequent amounts of explosives were needed for the provision of close combat means and for other needs, particularly for the pioneers.</body>\n",

      "When this directive was issued, the Commander-in-Chief East had at his disposal along his approximately 750-kilometer-long front from the Pilica to the Baltic Sea near Memel 38 infantry divisions, which were stationed everywhere on Russian soil, most densely on the right flank, while the extreme northern flank was almost unoccupied over a stretch of about 200 kilometers. The battles that followed the conclusion of the winter battle in Masuria and were particularly fierce in the foreland of the East Prussian southern border had subsided since the beginning of the month. Strength and combat power, however, were not yet fully restored everywhere, especially in the infantry, and artillery ammunition was constantly scarce. The formation of three new infantry divisions (101st, 103rd, and 105th) from contributions of existing divisions was underway.\n",

Vigorous aerial reconnaissance, patrol activity, and monitoring of enemy telegraphy, however, only revealed the picture of increased movements behind the positions up to the Vistula and offered no indication that the enemy intended to withdraw or significantly weaken his front. He continued to occupy his combat positions. A strong day's march behind these, flyers had identified long-established rear installations at Grojec and Blonie, which were used to approach the Vistula and Warsaw and had connections northwards to the large fortress of Nowogeorgiewsk.\n",

The necessary contributions for the formation of new divisions of their own balanced what the enemy withdrew, at least. The question of whether to launch an attack was denied, as the forces were insufficient for a major offensive, and small local successes would not justify the inevitable losses.

On May 14, the newly established Pioneer Regiment 36 was made available to the 9th Army as a gas unit. Its position seemed particularly suitable for gas release, as it faced east, which corresponded to the prevailing wind direction, and the distance to the enemy trenches was shorter than in other parts of the Eastern Front. The new combat means (alongside experiences made before Ypres2)) were expected to have such an effect with favorable winds that the Army Command hoped to be able to penetrate the Russian positions smoothly. At Ypres, only the forces had been lacking to exploit the unexpectedly favorable local success. The 9th Army now intended to deploy a total of 2½ army corps for the operation; the only question was where the thrust should be directed and what goal should be assigned to it.\n",

Nevertheless, a general retreat of the Russians from this area became a possibility. In such a case, the Commander-in-Chief East did not want to let the 9th Army pursue, but rather withdraw troops to use them at the Njemen, where the enemy at this time apparently attacked with strong forces3), suspected to relieve a possible retreat movement planned in Western Poland.

On May 31, at 2:30 a.m., the gas was released; the cloud moved towards the Russian positions. Half an hour later, however, the XVII Army Corps reported that the gas had apparently passed over the enemy too quickly, and water teams had been halted by Russian fire. To advance, the infantry demanded thorough artillery preparation. The Army Command called off the attack. Expectations had been disappointed. As early as May 28, the Supreme Army Command had stated in another context to the Commander-in-Chief East: \"To carry out our operations against Warsaw, the forces now standing at Bzura and Rawka will suffice if the gas means hold up somewhat to what can be expected from it based on previous performances.\" However, it had by no means had the effect that the troops had hoped for based on the experiences conveyed to them. They were only equipped with very inadequate gas protection means and therefore had 56 gas casualties out of a total loss of 374 men. It was considered possible that the Russians had been warned in advance and had used protective measures. The main reason for the failure of the still little-tested combat means was seen in the fact that strong, gusty winds had already dispersed the gas cloud, which was not dense enough due to too slow a release and had been lifted and driven too quickly over the foremost enemy trenches.”</body>\n",

The fact that the enemy, according to prisoner statements, had brought about two new divisions into the attacked section was to be welcomed from the standpoint of the overall situation on the Eastern Front. It also did not influence the decision of the 9th Army. They wanted to continue the attack using the gas, from whose effect they had now gained such a favorable impression that they expected an even greater success than on June 12. However, on June 17 and again on June 19, the preparations for the attack had to be abandoned due to a change in the wind. Waiting for the wind with filled gas cylinders in the trench became a severe test for officers and men.\n",
      "After Lemberg was taken on June 22, the Commander-in-Chief East considered the possibility of further Russian retreats also in West Poland; the 9th Army was initially to keep them in check with increased artillery fire. While the Russians then retreated further on June 24 in front of the right wing of the Army Group Woyrsch and the southern adjoining Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, they still stood before the main front of Colonel General von Woyrsch and the 9th Army.

      "To cover the southern flank of the attacking 11th Army against the fortress, the 119th Infantry Division of Major General von Behr was advanced immediately north of the San to west of Korzynitf. In front of their front were still detachments of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army. The 11th Bavarian Infantry Division under Major General Ritter von Kneußl gained the eastern exits of the forest and mountain terrain northwest of Przemysl. The XXXII Reserve Corps reached the line Kaszyce-Chlopice-Morawinsko in its advance on Radymno. The enemy held advanced fortification groups over the fortress area and apparently prepared positions in the hills west of Rada and forward Ostrow. The two corps set for the main attack on Jaroslaw advanced in sections. The Austro-Hungarian VI Corps had early determined that the enemy strongly occupied the heights south of Jaroslaw and the castle southwest of the city. Field Marshal Lieutenant von Arz wanted to lead his divisions under the cover of darkness to this enemy to attack him only in the morning by surprise. The corps encountered strong resistance. Only the right wing succeeded in advancing beyond Morawinsko in connection with the XXXII Reserve Corps. Elsewhere, fierce battles erupted along the entire attack front, which did not lead to a decision by evening. The Guard Corps had gradually approached the enemy under the increasing impression of only a weak occupation of Jaroslaw. When around noon the leader of the 2nd Guard Infantry Division, Lieutenant General von Winkler, reported that Jaroslaw seemed to be evacuated, the commanding general, General of Infantry Baron von Plattenberg, ordered that both divisions, if the opponent offered no stronger resistance, should take possession of the San line. However, the attack of the 2nd Guard Infantry Division against Jaroslaw also unexpectedly encountered strong enemy. The advance also suffered from the flanking fire effect from Jaroslaw Castle, which the Allies could not wrest from the enemy despite the use of reinforcements from the 2nd Guard Infantry Division; the forward movement came to a halt west of the city. The 1st Guard Infantry Division under the leadership of Colonel Eitel Friedrich Prince of Prussia was Russian posturing over a dead arm of the San north of Jaroslaw and could then only break through against the northern front of the city with its right wing by evening.\n",

The left wing had to remain bent back against positions at Morawisko, as the southern wing of the neighboring southwest VI Corps was fixed here. For this, it was crucial to first bring down the commanding heights around 264, the key point of the Jaroslaw bridgehead. This was only achieved at 6 p.m. Although fierce counterattacks by the enemy prevented full exploitation of this success, it had the effect to the north that by late evening, Jaroslaw Castle succumbed to the assault of the inner wings of the VI and Guard Corps, thereby eliminating the threat to the flank and rear of the 2nd Guard Infantry Division. The Guard Corps could only advance to attack in the afternoon after extensive artillery preparation against the enemy reinforced from the east bank. While the main forces of the 2nd Guard Infantry Division, due to the constant threat from the south, conducted only a holding battle on their right wing against the western front of Jaroslaw, the 1st Guard Infantry Division was to be deployed from the north for a decisive envelopment of Jaroslaw. This thrust of the right wing of the 1st Guard Infantry Division, joined by the left wing of the 2nd Guard Infantry Division, initially made good progress but then stalled in Jaroslaw. Here, when Jaroslaw Castle fell in the evening, the attack front had already solidified. Only the left wing of the 1st Guard Infantry Division pushed the enemy back over the San and reached the broad and deep main arm of the river west of Goryle. The immediate follow-up over this, which the General Command still hoped for, proved ineffective due to the strong occupation of the east bank overlooking the lowlands without sufficient artillery preparation.\n",
      "Since the Guard Corps had not succeeded in overcoming the San section the day before, and since the 19th Infantry Division faced considerable enemy forces to the north, the commanding general of the X Army Corps, General of Infantry von Emmich, now expected strong resistance at the San. Parts of the 20th Infantry Division had already been set in motion eastward early. When the directive from the Army High Command arrived at 11 a.m. to continue the attack in conjunction with the Guard Corps, the commander of the 20th Infantry Division, Lieutenant General Ritter and Edler von Detinger, received orders to take possession of the left bank of Niedebrowice.

The 19th Infantry Division under Lieutenant General Hofmann refrained from a planned attack early in the day against the strong Russian positions in the lowlands between Wisłok and San on the orders of the commanding general. General von Emmich believed that the enemy would abandon their positions opposite the 19th Infantry Division under the impression of the advance of the 20th Infantry Division and the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army against the San. Therefore, it was only to secure the attack of the 20th Infantry Division against a threat from the bridgehead of Sieniawa.\n",
      "The leader of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, Archduke Joseph Ferdinand, refrained from forcing the San crossing by his right army wing on the same day, as the Army High Command 11 had responded to an inquiry: \"Forcing a uniform advance on the entire front is not intended today... If a corps succeeds in crossing, this forcing will be followed by other corps.\" The San front of the 4th Army stretched north to the area west of Iwanow. The enemy positions, covered by forests and intersected by numerous streams, in the San-Vistula angle proved to be a resistance zone being expanded here. The addition of reinforcements over Sandomierz to the eastern Vistula bank and the deployment of forces already withdrawn to Sandomierz against the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army west of the Vistula suggested the enemy's intention to hold the San-Vistula angle and the connection to their positions on the far Vistula bank. This also seemed to give them the possibility of an offensive from the bridgehead of Sandomierz against the flank of the armies fighting at the San. The 4th Army, on the other hand, initially wanted to limit itself to establishing a \"reinforced resistance line\" and wait for the reinforcements currently in transport for their own attack.\n",
      "The Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army moved its left wing closer to the southwest front of Przemysl. The Beskiden Corps, which followed the retreating main Russian forces south of the fortress, encountered strong positions on both sides of Husztow behind Solotwina and Buchta. In this fortified section, which protected the road and railway leading south from Przemysl, strong enemy resistance was to be expected.

      "It was still questionable whether the significant partial success achieved by the center of the 11th Army on the battlefield around Jaroslaw could be expanded to achieve the goal sought by the leadership. The decision on this depended very much on the development of events on both army flanks. The XXXXI Reserve Corps of General von Francois had, as soon as the threat to its left flank was eliminated by the advance of the northern neighbor, initiated a rightward swing to attack. Faced with this impending encirclement, the enemy retreated over Tuczepy on the road to Radymno. Only east of Tuczepy did the left wing of the 82nd Reserve Division encounter the northern part of the enemy's main position. After hard fighting in the afternoon, the entire attack line of the XXXXI Reserve Corps came to a halt before this.

To protect the right wing held at Zamoscie, the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division was pushed up to the Raba. The 119th Infantry Division swung forward to Batycze. At 6 p.m., the Kneussl Corps received the message that an attack against the occupied line north of Przemysl was not in line with the Army High Command's intentions. It would mean a concentration of forces in a direction incompatible with the army's tasks east of the San. Therefore, no more forces were to be used against the enemy at the Rada than required for the protection of the right flank of the XXXXI Reserve Corps. The 119th Infantry Division was to be held back to be available as an army reserve at any time. The Army High Command hoped that Przemysl would soon succumb to the attack of the right neighbor army and wanted to keep the striking power of the 11th Army for the breakthrough over the San downstream from Przemysl with the goal of Rawa Ruska undiminished.\n",
      "North of the battlefield of Jaroslaw, the 20th Infantry Division now faced the task of forcing the river crossing as soon as possible. In the open lowland terrain, the preparation for this was very difficult. It was only possible to cross at night, despite considerable losses. A bridgehead was established west of Wiazownica. It was the intention of General von Emmich, after further advancing the 20th Infantry Division on the eastern bank, to also bring the 19th Infantry Division into the attack on the enemy still facing them.</body>\n",

      "At the San Front of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, the river crossing was unsuccessful. North of the Vistula, a surprising setback occurred. The Austro-Hungarian 1st Army and the Army Detachment Woyrsch, in their forward movement since May 11th, under multiple local night skirmishes against the northeastward retreating Russians, reached the general line: Koprzywnica—Staszów—Mircze—north of Wisłoka—Gąbin on May 16th. However, on the morning of May 16th, the Russians launched a counterattack against the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army and the southern flank of the Army Detachment Woyrsch, particularly targeting the inner flanks and the weakly secured gap between the two armies. The ensuing battles forced the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army to withdraw its northern flank by up to ten kilometers. This also prompted the 4th Army to hold back its left flank. Behind it, the three approaching reinforcement divisions had reached the beginnings of Debica, Radomysl, and the area east of Tarnow. General von Conrad now redirected one of these divisions (41st Infantry Division) via Szczucin to support the 1st Army. The left flank of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army reached just west of Pratkowice. On both sides of the Wisłoka, the attack lines moved closer to the fort line. Further east, however, the attack against the Słotwina—Butcha section did not break through. The line of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army extended from here to Kaisersdorf on the Dniester (20 kilometers northeast of Sambor).\n",

The right wing of the 56th Infantry Division attempted to relieve the Guard Corps by advancing on Cetula in the evening but did not penetrate the village.

The Army High Command expected that the enemy, to prevent the deployment of further forces of the 4th Army on the eastern bank, would advance against the breach point of the army on the San. Therefore, the army reserve was moved there. To preempt the expected Russian attack from the bridgehead of Sandomierz on the eastern bank of the Vistula, the High Command decided to deploy its two available reinforcement divisions (Hungarian 37th and Austrian 21st Infantry Division) to the left army wing for an imminent attack downstream along the Vistula.\n",

Across the entire front of the 11th Army, only isolated skirmishes occurred without changing the situation. Only the struggle for the bridgehead at Siennawa was brought to a successful conclusion. Early in the morning, the parts of the 20th and 19th Infantry Divisions deployed north of Lubaczowka had taken control of the heights between Mielnit and the Slawa Heights. Then the left wing of the 19th Infantry Division swung north to support the allies advancing against the Slawa Heights. After extensive artillery preparation, this stronghold also fell in the morning. After such setbacks, the enemy, aided by torrential downpours, quickly disappeared into the large forests east of Siennawa; only cavalry followed them. The captured positions were fortified for defense. On the rest of the San front of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, the situation could be improved again. Against its northern front between the San and Vistula, the enemy advanced, partly in individual thrusts, closer.\n",
      "In the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, a relaxation occurred. In fourteen days of heavy fighting, this army and the Landwehr Division, reinforced by parts of the Landwehr Corps under Lieutenant General Count von Bredow, managed to halt the Russian attack on May 19 along the line Kopryznnica—Bzielufta—Strykow. The threat of an enemy breakthrough in the gap between Bzielufta and Chybiec was eliminated by deploying parts of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army and the Landwehr Division Bredow, as well as the Austro-Hungarian 7th Cavalry Division; the Austro-Hungarian 9th Cavalry Division positioned itself as an army reserve behind the army front.

The right wing of the Southern Army, the Gerok Corps, also encountered fierce resistance on the forest heights south and southwest of Dolina and had to wait for the arrival of artillery before considering continuing the attack. The gain in territory was greater in the center and on the left wing. The Austro-Hungarian 131st Infantry Brigade occupied Bolechow after a brief street fight and advanced to the Smica. From the Bothmer Corps, the 1st Infantry Division reached the area east and northeast of Siemiginow; the 3rd Guard Infantry Division drove weak enemy forces from Uliczno but stood by late evening east of it on both sides of the railway towards Stryj before strong positions. The Hungarian 38th and 40th Infantry Divisions also found the heights east of Drohobycz occupied; the Austro-Hungarian 7th Infantry Division reached Lisznia.

On May 18, he informed the 11th Army Command that another use of the 11th Army could only be considered once the enemy had been driven from its current position. The sooner this happened, the more welcome it would be in view of the overall situation. The halt in the attack, which had occurred with the armies of the Carpathian front fighting south of Przemysl after initial successes since May 17, diminished the hope of quickly reaching the Dnjestr-Wisznia line and thus a rapid change in the situation in Bukovina.\n",
      "General von Falkenhayn saw the most effective means to get the stalled overall operation moving again in an advance of the 11th Army to the southeast. On the afternoon of May 18, still unaware of the day's battles, he initially inquired with the 11th Army Command, \"why not advance the VI and Guard Corps further south or southeast to relieve the XXXXI Reserve Corps and the 11th Bavarian Division at Radymno and Przemysl and, in the further course, also the left wing of the 3rd Army southeast of Przemysl.\" This inquiry coincided with a report from Army Command 1, which expressed the general impression that the enemy was retreating before the center and left wing, but was trying to hold the San from Radymno upwards as well as Przemysl. Before any further major offensive, the reorganization of supplies and the establishment of a new base on the San were necessary, which would take a few days due to the difficult road conditions and the distance from railway centers. The army intended to first attack Radymno and thereby enclose Przemysl in the north. However, the infantry attack on Przemysl was not intended without special orders.\n",
      "From the response that the 11th Army Command then gave to the inquiry itself, General von Falkenhayn saw that the advance to the southeast he had suggested was already considered by Generaloberst von Mackensen, \"as soon as the army corps have gained enough space and freedom of movement to the east.\"\n",

I would like to emphasize once again the importance of the issue given the rapid escalation of the military-political situation. The enemy's movements reported yesterday by rail and foot march suggest that he has significantly weakened in front of the actual front of the army. On the other hand, he seems to be strengthening Przemysl and his positions there for political reasons. As far as can be judged from here, it should then be possible to leave a screen against the east and north and to attempt a breakthrough thrust on both sides of the Wisznia with closely assembled main forces.\"\n",
      "In his response to this suggestion, the Chief of Staff of the 11th Army, Colonel von Seeckt, pointed out that the 11th and 4th Armies had been attacked on May 19 along their entire front, most strongly over Radymno and south of it. Once the situation is clarified and sufficient ammunition is procured, the proposed breakthrough over the line Zablotsce—Radymno—Lazy would be initiated.\n",
      "The 11th Army Command intended to have the XXXXI Reserve Corps, Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, Guard Corps, and the 119th Infantry Division ready by May 22 along the approximate line Kaluszce—Malowisko, to begin the attack towards Buczow—Galicia on the 23rd. The 11th Bavarian Infantry Division was to cover against Przemysl, and the X Army Corps was to take over the previous front of the Guard Corps. The Lubaczowka was envisaged as the boundary against the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. This army was thus assigned another position over its already widely extended front. This could only be done by deploying its last reserves on the right wing of the army. The two reinforcement divisions on the march were therefore diverted to the right. Since a local setback had occurred at Sieniawa on the right wing of the 4th Army, this was not extended to the Lubaczowka, but only to Sady.</body>\n",

      "In the army order issued on May 20 at 6 p.m., the purpose of the new offensive of the 11th Army was determined to be \"to disrupt the rear connections of Przemysl and facilitate the advance of the 3rd and 2nd Armies southeast of Przemysl.\" This required a pivot of the assault group to the southeast. Accordingly, the attack sectors were assigned. The k.u.k. VI Corps and the Guard Corps were to move to the right. The XXXXII Reserve Corps was instructed to deploy strong forces behind its left wing. The start of the attack could only be scheduled for May 24, as the reliefs at the 4th Army were delayed. This army intended to carry out its assigned cover to the north through its own offensive on Sandomierz. The two neighboring armies to the right, the 3rd and 2nd Armies, were ordered by the k.u.k. Army Command to break through on May 24 as well, continuing the planned attack on the fortress of Przemysl with the inner wings and advancing through the foothills of the Carpathians \"up to the railway and road on both sides of Mosciska.\"\n",
      "Along the entire front of the allies from the middle of the Carpathians to the area north of the Vistula, a unified attack was to be launched. It was hoped that the pincer attack on both sides of Przemysl would quickly bring down the fortress and then clear the way for gaining the Wisznia–Dniester section.\n",
      "The Russians remained calm on the entire front until the start of the attack. This benefited the planned course of the relief movement and the replenishment of ammunition supplies. According to the army order of the 11th Army issued on May 22, the artillery firing on May 23 was to be followed by effective firing on May 24 at 6 a.m. The assault was set for 8 a.m. The 119th Infantry Division was to be ready as army reserve at Dobkowice–Bratyn.\n",
      "The reconnaissance flights conducted in clear weather, supported by photographic surveys, had supplemented the troops' findings about the enemy. The first Russian position, already known, north of the Rada, in the line Ostrow–Wietlin–Madywka–Cetula, was strongly fortified. Behind it, the defense zone was structured, gradually eastward from Rada and San towards Radymno, deeply entrenched. Thus, the bridgehead of Radymno represented a stronghold of special defensive strength. Another position, also adjoining the Rada on the left wing, extended over the narrower bridgehead east of Radymno behind the Wisznia to Lasy and was on the northern wing bent back to the heights of Laszki and Tuchla.\n",

According to previous findings, the opposing Russian 3rd Army consisted of the XIII Corps (19th, 12th, ½ 81st Infantry and 3rd Don Cossack Division) northeast of Przemysl, the XXI Corps (33rd, 44th Infantry, 16th Cavalry Division) at Radymno, the V Caucasian Corps (3rd Caucasian, 43rd Infantry, 3rd Rifle, 7th Cavalry Division and three Foot Cossack Brigades) northeast of Jaroslaw, and the III Caucasian Corps (34th, 21st, 52nd Infantry and 13th Siberian Rifle Division) at Sieniawa. One had to expect stubborn resistance from the Russians. The enemy's front covered the most important road and rail junctions to the capital of Galicia: from Przemysl via Grodek, from Radymno via Jaworów, and from Jaroslaw via Rawa Ruska to Lemberg. Therefore, the main concern of the army high command was to provide sufficient quantities of ammunition for the attack. Since the supply railway of the 11th Army was only completed to Strzyzow northeast of Jaslo on May 19, all troop and column vehicles and all remaining transport in the country were made available for ammunition transport with the greatest emphasis.\n",
      "The XXXXI Reserve Corps wanted to focus on the front section north of the railway, which cuts through Ostrow. Here on the main road to Radymno, a series of entrenchments and height 202, which dominates the river junction, formed the key point of the enemy position. The 82nd Reserve Division was to launch a decisive breakthrough against it and open the northern adjoining front from Torbech. The h.u. VII Corps focused its attack on the east bank of the San against Wietlin. The Guard Corps initially wanted to deploy only the reinforced 1st Guard Infantry Division against the area north of Wietlin, between Szklo and Makowisko, while the 2nd Guard Infantry Division was positioned on the main road to Makowisko. It was later to advance over Makowisko to cover the left flank. The reinforced X Army Corps was tasked with protecting the attack to the north. General von Cramon wanted to solve this task offensively by attacking the 20th and 56th Infantry Division through the forests north of Oleszyce to the heights around Cetula, to hold as many enemy forces here as possible. The Lubaczowka front was to remain defensive.\n",
      "The protection of the right flank of the attacking 11th Army was entrusted to the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division with the Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division under its command. It was to adapt its left wing to the advance of the XXXXI Reserve Corps. At the same time, it was tasked with \"encircling the northern front of Przemysl.\"</body>\n",

      "<body>Speculations about Przemysl fluctuated. Initially, the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division believed in a strong occupation of the fort belt. Then, the impression grew that no significant Russian forces were in the fortress. Intercepted conversations even suggested an imminent evacuation. Other reports stated that the Russians wanted to hold the fortress for political reasons. Initially, the High Command of the 11th Army had no intention of concentrating heavy artillery against the northern front or conducting an attack on the fortress itself without a special order*). However, when the idea of a forcible capture was considered, General von Kneussl proposed an attack on the northern front. This perspective was already taken into account in the redistribution of heavy artillery. The 11th Bavarian Infantry Division was also instructed to act immediately if the evacuation of the fortress was confirmed. However, the impression remained that the enemy was positioned behind the Rada in the line Mackowice—Bathzize—Walawa intended for the encirclement of the northern front of Przemysl. It was hoped that the pressure from the main force of the 11th Army to the southwest would also bring down this position. To strengthen the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division for its new task, its right flank was relieved by cavalry.\n",
      "The Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army could only plan the start of its assigned systematic attack on the southwestern front of Przemysl for May 28 due to the late arrival of heavy artillery.\n",
      "Dense morning fog still lay over the San lowlands when, on May 24 at 6 a.m., the artillery began its effective fire along the entire attack front of the 11th Army. Punctually at 8 a.m., the infantry assault began. The enemy, prepared for defense, had artillery that was considerably larger in number and more richly supplied with ammunition than before. Heavy guns from the fortress area also engaged the front attacking west of the San. The XXXXI Reserve Corps stationed there faced a difficult task. But within minutes, a determined leap led the decisive battle of the 82nd Reserve Division into the entrenchments east of Tuczapy and further against the northern part of Ostrow. This impact in the north quickly overcame the front west of Ostrow. By 8:25 a.m., General von Francois could already report: \"Heights west and northwest of Ostrow taken.\"</body>\n",

Under this bilateral encirclement, the defense in Ostrow completely collapsed. In the northern part of the battlefield, Generalmajor Fabarius set the next line of heights before Radymno as the target for his 82nd Reserve Division and moved his reserves along the main road. The rapid success achieved in a determined direction so shook the Russian infantry that their resistance weakened and they surrendered en masse. The tirelessly advancing infantry of the 82nd Reserve Division reached the heights before Radymno before the Russian batteries standing there in fire could bring up their reserves for rescue. In the infantry and machine gun fire, the teams collapsed. Reserves advancing on the road to Radymno reached the rear of the bravely resisting batteries. After these great successes, mainly due to the determination of the troops, the leadership of the 82nd Reserve Division gained the impression that with decisive action, Radymno itself would soon fall. General Fabarius therefore ordered the continuation of the attack on the place at 9 a.m. Further south, the 81st Reserve Division had encountered new resistance on the heights west of Stolziszow. However, after Generalmajor von Stöcken had his previously held back right wing advance northwest of Zamojce for encirclement, covered to the south by the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division, the enemy defense collapsed so quickly that Russian batteries were also overrun here. Now the 81st Reserve Division wanted to advance with the mass into the southern part of Stolziszow, while the right wing had to cover this advance on the heights north of the lower, deeply cut Rada. Both divisions of the XXXXI Reserve Corps were thus set for the attack on the second enemy position zone at 10 a.m., only two hours after the start of the storm. Flyers had observed numerous marching columns east of Radymno retreating behind the San.\n",
      "The battle at the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps did not initially proceed as successfully. Although its right wing had joined the rapid victory march of the 82nd Reserve Division south of the San. By 10 a.m., the route Ostrow—Wysocko was reached. Some guns had also fallen into the hands of the Hungarians here. However, the front of the Hungarian 39th Infantry Division in the field marshal's command of Hadik had to be covered, as its left wing remained completely tied up at the San near Adamowka. Because the main attack of the VI Corps on the right bank against Bielstin was not destined for quick success.\n",

      "Bielstin did not achieve a quick success. Leaning against the San lowlands and the Szklo, the enemy offered stubborn resistance, particularly in entrenchments west of Bielstin. The attack stalled completely here. To get the advance north of the San moving and thus eliminate the flanking fire that was hindering the attack on Radzyno, the artillery of the Hungarian 39th Infantry Division and partly also that of the XXXXI Reserve Corps directed their fire northward. However, this support only affected the combat area immediately east of the San. At Bielstin, the Austro-Hungarian 12th Infantry Division of Field Marshal Lieutenant Kestranek was still held fast for the time being.\n",
      "The same happened to the left neighboring southern wing of the 1st Guard Infantry Division. Under the effect of enemy flanking fire from Bielstin, it was initially unable to advance. However, a breakthrough further north in the middle between Szklo and Malowisko was successful. Parts turning north soon also cleared the way for the left wing attacking through Malowisko to break through the breach towards Bobrowka. The units of the 2nd Guard Infantry Division deployed here to support the 1st Guard Infantry Division were then reassigned to General von Windler on the left corps wing for unified command.\n",
      "The X Army Corps had already intended to take the positions around Cetula by surprise attack early in the morning before the start of the general attack, which, according to prisoner reports, was supposed to have become known to the enemy. However, this did not succeed. Made aware by this attempt, the enemy was prepared for defense against the X Army Corps. A unified attack no longer occurred. The right corps wing, the 20th Infantry Division, separated from the Guard by a swamp area, gained some ground towards Olszowa. But the left wing and the 56th Infantry Division were stuck in heavy fighting around Cetula.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the attack of the XXXXI Reserve Corps on Radzyno had made favorable progress. By noon, the place was in the hands of the 82nd Reserve Division, and the 81st pushed further south into the immediately adjacent village of Stolzowo. During these battles, aerial reconnaissance determined that the road from Radzyno via Duntowice to Zalesta Wola was covered with several side-by-side marching columns. Troops of all arms hurriedly moved over the San bridges east of Radzyno. A wild confusion arose among the masses gathering there.

During the advance of the 82nd Reserve Division through Radymno, intense panic arose again among the Russian infantry, so that more batteries, trying to escape through the city, fell into German hands. Both divisions already believed they could pursue these disintegrating units. However, the enemy positioned itself in prepared positions before the 81st Reserve Division on the heights of the eastern Rada bank. The division reorganized for a new attack, while the right wing was to advance on the eastern Rada bank towards Zadarowice for flank security. By pushing the division towards Stolzson, a noticeable gap had formed between it and the northern wing of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division, which had meanwhile occupied Zablonce. The execution of the attack proved impossible here, especially as the enemy itself launched a counterattack. The 82nd Reserve Division managed to establish itself on the flat height east of Radymno. However, the attack strength of this division, which had become quite confused in the local combat, seemed nearly exhausted. Its left wing had to remain strongly bent back, as the Hungarians to the north could not follow the rapid attack course. The bridgehead of Zagrody effectively flanked any further advance of the division. Freshly brought-in reserves initially swung east against it, but encountered strong enemy defense there at 3 p.m. Although the attack of the XXXXI Reserve Corps had come to a halt along the entire line, General von Francois still hoped to advance to the San line, possibly even further, today. In response to this intention reported to the army command, the approving answer came at 3 p.m.: \"Since the enemy still holds east of Przemysl, a quick advance against its rear is very promising.\" When it soon became apparent that the Russian command had managed to reestablish their collapsed front between the Rada and the bridgehead of Zagrody, the army command decided to fill the gap that had formed between the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division and the XXXXI Reserve Corps. It was hoped that this would give new impetus to the advance of this corps against the San. At 4 p.m., the order was given to the 119th Infantry Division to advance over Zamostje—Zadarowice.

The infantry, advancing with fresh momentum, effectively supported by the accompanying artillery, broke through two enemy defensive belts and thus wrested the strong bridgehead of Radymno from the enemy. In doing so, 52 guns were captured and 9000 prisoners were taken.\n",
      "The 39th Infantry Division, positioned on the right flank of the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps in the difficult lowland terrain on both sides of the San, could not keep pace with the rapid advance of the XXXXI Reserve Corps. Flanking fire from Wietlin also hampered their attack. It was not until 4 p.m. that the northern exit of Radymno was reached. The bridgehead of Zagrody also halted further advance here, as with the neighboring 82nd Reserve Division on the right. The frontal attack by the Hungarians did not break through. On the battlefield of the 12th Infantry Division, Wietlin, the hotly contested redoubt west of the town was brought down at 11 a.m. with support from the 1st Guard Infantry Division. However, Wietlin itself was still stubbornly held by the enemy. It was only when the division directed its main thrust through the suburb of the town towards the Sbychow—Drejna road and reached it at 2 p.m. that resistance in Wietlin finally collapsed. In the hope that the attack of the inner flanks of both divisions, slowly advancing through particularly difficult swampy terrain between the San and Wietlin, would now gain momentum, the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps received the order from the army high command at 3 p.m. to \"capture the line east of Grabowice—Dunkowice—Lazy in connection with the XXXXI Reserve Corps and Guard Corps today.\" However, this proved impossible. The army high command now emphasized that it was important to \"break through from Wietlin via Zagrody to advance on the right bank of the San as soon as possible and thus facilitate the advance of the XXXXI Reserve Corps.\" \"Above all, the VI Corps must soon be able to bring the Radymno—Grabowice road under fire.\" However, the Austro-Hungarian 12th Infantry Division did not succeed in making significant progress against the strong enemy position between Zagrody and Lazy in the open terrain exposed to flanking.

The General Command now placed the focus of further operations on it. In the line Dreśina—Adamowka¹), the 1st Guard Infantry Division encountered new strong resistance at 1 p.m. After breaking this, the division pushed towards the heavily fortified Łazy. The enemy responded with fierce counterattacks. Heavy fighting raged here until evening, without significant ground being gained. On the left wing, the 2nd Guard Infantry Division advanced after capturing the heights north of Małowisko to attack Adamowka—Bobrowka. But here too, the enemy launched a counterattack at 6 p.m. Bobrowka was no longer reached. 5000 prisoners were captured by the Guard Corps during the day.\n",
      "Following the successes of the 2nd Guard Infantry Division at Małowisko, the right wing of the X Army Corps also advanced vigorously in the afternoon. By 7 p.m., the enemy forest positions on both sides of Olchowo had fallen. In stubborn fighting, parts of the 20th Infantry Division pushed through to the edge of the forest, and by 10 p.m. Chodana was taken. The repeatedly fierce battle for Cetula, however, no longer achieved its goal. The command gained the impression that strong Russian forces were still present here and also on the Łubaczówka front. Thus, despite only minor territorial gains, the attack by the Emmich Corps succeeded in holding significant enemy forces here, away from the decision.\n",
      "The overall result of the day was that the 11th Army had broken through the newly established enemy front over a width of 20 kilometers and gained 5 kilometers of space. Nevertheless, the enemy managed to position itself, leaning on Przemyśl, in a westward-facing defensive position. Prisoner statements revealed that on May 22, the order was given to hold Przemyśl. On May 23, aircraft observed only limited traffic from the fortress in an easterly direction. If this was to be maintained, the 11th Army had to reckon with the enemy continuing to offer the strongest resistance on the connection front protecting the links from Przemyśl.

      "Since the battles were not yet concluded in the evening, the high command could not foresee what situation would arise the next morning. It was therefore left to the initiative of the subordinate commanders to exploit their previous successes within the framework of the given attack objectives on May 25. Initially, this did not succeed on the right wing of the army. The 11th Bavarian Infantry Division hoped, by advancing in conjunction with the 119th Infantry Division, to roll up the Rada position from the north and then swing into the desired encirclement position opposite the northern front of Przemysl. The 119th Infantry Division had reached the heights east of Zablcce during the night and wanted to advance with its right wing southward along the Rada. However, this attack did not progress by midday, while the Bavarians managed to take Drohojow by surprise. At the XXXXI Reserve Corps, the 81st Reserve Division made its further advance from Zamosc—Stoloszow eastward dependent on the progress of the 119th Infantry Division on its right flank. Since the 82nd Reserve Division also had to repel strong attacks during the night, General von Francois considered a systematic preparation of the attack against the re-strengthened enemy necessary. Above all, the division's advance to the east seemed only possible if the bridgehead of Zagrody on the left flank had fallen.\n",
      "Here, the nightly and repeated morning assault by the Hungarians had not yet achieved success. A relief through the center of the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, which did not advance in the open terrain north of the San, was not to be expected. Therefore, Field Marshal Lieutenant Arz emphasized the left wing of the corps to take Lasy in conjunction with the southern wing of the guard. This succeeded at 10 a.m. However, the local battle also attracted further southern adjacent parts. In the gap created north of the San, the corps reserve was now regrouped to the rear of the bridgehead of Zagrody.\n",

      "In front of the X Army Corps, the enemy had evacuated the hotly contested Cetula during the night. By 3:30 in the morning, the elevation mass projecting into the Lubaczowka lowland east of the place had been occupied by the 56th Infantry Division. General von Emmich now intended to also prepare the 20th Infantry Division at and north of Chodanie for the advance against the upper Lubaczowka. This connection initially caused some concern at the Army High Command that the bridgehead taken so far could be threatened from the east. However, the concern was soon dispelled, as Ryszkowa Wola and Zapalow were already found free of enemies in the early morning hours. Flyers confirmed at 9:00 in the morning that the Russians had withdrawn their forces to the southeast. The forward movement of the 20th Infantry Division was to take place at noon.\n",
      "At this time, the High Command of the 11th Army assessed the situation such that the previous good progress north of the Wisznia would also help the attack group on both sides of the San, which still encountered strong resistance east of Radymno. If it succeeded in reaching the San, for which there seemed to be justified prospects, the impact on the enemy in front of the 3rd and 2nd Army had to be felt and force him to retreat. This necessitated continuing the attack of the 11th Army in the chosen direction with all forces.\n",
      "However, the hopes of the Army High Command were initially not fully realized. The right wing of the army did not make significant progress. In the course of the afternoon, the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division succeeded, under heavy fighting, in advancing its left wing at and north of Andrykow. The 119th Infantry Division advanced on the heights east of Rada but soon stalled again in front of Zadabrowie.

The attack by the corps reserve of the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, which struck the bridgehead of Zagrody from the rear at 4 p.m., brought it down. Subsequently, the 39th Infantry Division advanced on the eastern bank of the San up to Grabowice. The 12th Infantry Division also pushed forward after successfully concluding the battles around Lazy, pursuing the retreating enemy over the Wisznia between Duniowice and Lazy during the afternoon.\n",

The center had already launched an attack against the heights west and north of Laszki at 1 p.m. Despite fierce and openly conducted defense and after lively local skirmishes, the enemy had to abandon Laszki by 4 p.m. In the evening, the center reached both sides of the Silo up to Charytany—Zamecznik. The right wing was also able to advance eastward beyond Lazy without encountering strong resistance. On the left corps wing, shortly after 2 p.m., the forces stationed at Bobrowka advanced to attack Zagrody. Despite heavy flanking fire from the north, the town was secured by 6 p.m.\n",

Their command area had meanwhile extended across the Vistula, as the 5th and 1st Army was subordinated to them as \"Group Kirchbach\"¹). On the northern river bank, the enemy had evacuated their positions in front of the left wing of the 5th and 1st Army and the Landwehr Division Bredow on May 22, but had already established new resistance several kilometers further east. After a feint operation on May 24 at the San front, the planned advance towards Sandomierz took place the next day on both sides of the Vistula. However, only some enemy forward positions were overcome. The High Command of the 11th Army requested the 4th Army at 7 p.m. to relieve the elements of the German 19th Infantry Division deployed in the bridgehead of Sieniawa, in order to draw them in for the breakthrough of the 11th Army. The relief was promised for the night of May 27.\n",
      "The progress of the neighboring 5th, 3rd, and 2nd Army to the right against the road east of Przemysl had been minimal so far. The troops had not been able to meet General von Conrad's demand that the attack of both armies should reach the Mosciska—Przemysl road on May 25. A breakthrough into enemy lines had not occurred. Thus, there was no serious threat to the rear connections from Przemysl from the southern direction so far. This was largely due to the circumstance that strong artillery had to be deployed for the 3rd Army's attack against the western front of Przemysl, leaving only weak artillery available for the thrust of the inner wings of both armies. Additionally, there was an ammunition shortage due to difficult supply conditions in the mountains. It was intended to more closely consolidate the Beskiden Corps and the left wing of the 2nd Army under the command of General von der Marwitz on May 26 to achieve success.\n",
      "In the evening, aviators observed the departure of enemy columns from Przemysl towards the east and from Balice in front of the right wing of the 3rd Army towards the northeast. It was uncertain whether these movements were to be seen as the beginning of an enemy withdrawal to the east or were intended to reinforce their front, which was under heavy pressure from the 11th Army. In any case, the task remained for all armies to continue their attacks in the established directions with all forces.\n",

      "The morning of May 26 brought no significant change for the right wing of the 11th Army. Since the 119th Infantry Division was held back by the army high command, the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division, relying solely on itself, could not advance beyond the Rada. At the XXXXI Reserve Corps, the 82nd Reserve Division continued in a tough, indecisive village fight around Swiete. In front of the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, the enemy had retreated to a position east of Grabowice—Nienowice—Piaśki. At 10 a.m., they were attacked here. The enemy had retreated from the Guard Corps. Only by noon did the 1st Guard Infantry Division encounter resistance from Zaleska Wola. The 2nd Guard Infantry Division broke through at noon in the march through Mielciz Stary and Korzenica. The enemy stood here in line Łuchla—Mielciz Nowy—Butkowina. General Freiherr von Plettenberg intended to advance the 1st Guard Infantry Division on Chalupki Chotyniecice under the cover of the left flank by the 2nd Guard Infantry Division.\n",
      "In this situation, Generaloberst von Mackensen gave the following order to General von Francois at 1 p.m.: \"Since the XXXXI Reserve Corps can no longer advance in the front, it must now attempt to bring the 81st Reserve Division and, to the left, the 82nd Reserve Division across the San under the protection of the 119th Infantry Division, which is now assigned for this purpose. ... The overall situation urgently requires that the San be crossed today in line Barcz—Nienowice.\"\n",
      "General von Francois then ordered the 82nd Reserve Division at 3 p.m. to push through to the southern edge of Swiete. This goal was reached by 5 p.m. From the 81st Reserve Division, the initially available parts and, after relief by the 119th Infantry Division, the rest were to reach the eastern bank of the San via Michalowka during the night, to later advance on the shortest route via Stubno—Bucow against the road Przemysl—Mosćiska and to use the artillery assigned to the division against the fortress connections. During the night, the 81st Reserve Division moved between the parts of the 82nd Reserve Division located on the eastern bank of the San and the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps.\n",

No successes were achieved on May 26 at the junction of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd and 2nd Armies either.\n",
      "The allied army commands had planned the later expansion of the San–Wisznia line during their agreements on the continuation of operations on May 12.1) After important parts of this section had now fallen into the hands of the attacking army, General von Conrad ordered on May 26 the expansion of the San line and the captured bridgeheads, adding that this \"naturally must not hinder the continuation of the offensive in any way.\" The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army was to fortify the bridgehead of Sieniawa and the line reached so far in the San–Vistula angle. The 11th Army then ordered the X and Guard Corps to expand their positions by advancing the right wing to Młyn north of the main road to Krakowiec. The Austro-Hungarian VI Corps was to advance north of the Wisznia over Kalników–Zalazie. For the attack group of General von Francois, it was ordered: \"XXXXI Reserve Corps with 119th Infantry Division retains the task of advancing south of the Wisznia, which now forms the border with the VI Corps, towards the Medyka–Mościska road. Right border free.\" The cover of the right flank on the western San bank remained with the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division with the Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division. This gave General von Francois more leeway to push the attack part on the previously gained large bridgehead of the 11th Army against the connections from Przemyśl.

However, at 11:45 a.m., he called upon the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division to relieve the troops of the 119th Infantry and the 82nd Reserve Division located on the western bank of the San. General von Kneussl, on the other hand, was of the opinion that due to the resulting extension of his division over twelve kilometers, overcoming the enemy's elevated position east of the Rada was no longer possible for him. He considered the involvement of the units subordinated to General von Francois in this task on the western San bank still necessary and presented this view to General von Francois. However, he was convinced that the resistance on the western side opposite the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division would also collapse through the full-force attack on the eastern bank. The Army High Command initially agreed with the measures of General von Francois but decided in favor of General von Kneussl after receiving his statement and ordered at 3:15 p.m.: \"XXXXI Reserve Corps is to first secure possession of Sosnica with its right wing, and advance with the left wing over Stubienko to Stubno. After gaining Sosnica, the right wing is to take the direction towards Bucow. The 119th Infantry Division is to follow up to Sosnica. Connection of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division via Zadobrowce to Drohojow.\" Under these circumstances, the decisive advance on the eastern bank could only become effective with full force once the Francois group had completed its task on the western bank. The influence of the Przemysl fortress on the course of operations became apparent.\n",
      "The attack battle of the XXXXI Reserve Corps initiated in the meantime on both San banks remained unaffected by this exchange of opinions. The 119th Infantry Division only wrested the heights immediately south of Zamoscie from the enemy in the evening and maintained connection there with the 82nd Reserve Division. The repeated attacks of this division against the enemy, effectively supported by the artillery of the fortress, had not been successful. Only when parts of the division intervened from the other San bank in the afternoon, was it finally possible to penetrate the northern part of Sosnica. The 81st Reserve Division, now deployed on the flat eastern bank between San and Wisznia, pushed forward with the focus of its left wing towards the southeast. It encountered strong resistance along the Barcza-Stubienko line. Under the pressure of the superior force, the enemy was forced to withdraw from Stubienko at 4:00 p.m. and in the evening also from Stubno.</body>\n",

      "East of the Wisznia, the Austro-Hungarian VI. and the Guard Corps had accompanied the advance of the XXXXI Reserve Corps with echelons from the right wing. In the afternoon hours, the Allies captured Kalnikow and the heights south of the town after heavy fighting. Further north, the line from the eastern edge of Kalnikow—west of Mlyny—height west of Tuchla was conquered, where the planned defensive front was to be established.\n",
      "On the left army wing, a serious threat was emerging. Already during the night and throughout the entire day, strong enemy thrusts across the Lubaczowka had to be repelled along the entire front of the 20th and the now eleven-kilometer-extended 56th Infantry Division. Particularly in front of the left wing of the 56th Infantry Division at the Lubaczowka bend east of Czerwona Wola, strong enemy forces appeared to be massing. The approach of considerable troops unloading at Lubaczow was reported by aircraft at noon. The Army High Command therefore positioned a regiment from the 19th Infantry Division, which had been withdrawn as reserve, at Piwoda for the right wing of the X Army Corps and made another regiment of the 56th Infantry Division available.\n",
      "While the left wing of the 11th Army stood firm despite enemy attacks, the Russians achieved a major success north of the Lubaczowka against the bridgehead of Sieniawa. After Czech troops failed during the night and the Slawa Heights were lost, the entire Allied defense completely collapsed. Numerous Austro-Hungarian batteries fell into enemy hands. Reserves were unable to restore the situation. The German X Army Corps, itself under heavy attack, was unable to provide assistance. Thus, the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army had to withdraw behind the Lubaczowka and the San after several futile attempts to rebuild the defense east of the San. At 8:45 in the evening, Colonel General von Mackensen approved this arrangement but simultaneously ordered the cessation of the offensive movement against Sandomierz to free up forces for the endangered right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. Also on the left bank of the Vistula, the attack of the Kirchbach group and the right wing of the Woyrsch Army Detachment in the Klimontow–Jezow–Stychow line finally came to a halt.</body>\n",

Under the impression of the bold advance of the 81st Reserve Division on the southern bank of the San, the enemy was retreating before the entire front of General von François. The rest of the army's front held its positions against enemy partial attacks except for a local loss at Kalniów. This made it possible for the army command to release forces to counter an extension of Russian successes at Sieniawa to the western bank of the San and the left flank of the 11th Army. Parts of the 19th Infantry Division were sent to Wola Buchowska. The 119th Infantry Division was moved to Jaroslaw, except for the divisional staff and a reinforced infantry regiment, which were subordinated to the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division, to which two battalions of the Guard Corps were also transferred. The Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division, without its rifle unit, which remained with the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division, was also set in motion to Jaroslaw.

      "The attack preparations of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division against Przemysl itself proceeded as planned on May 30. At 10 a.m., the artillery began its fire in clear weather. The assault was scheduled for May 31 at 6:15 a.m. General von Francois continued to strive to push his right wing forward on both sides of the San, to bring his heavy artillery further south to effectively impact the connections from Przemysl. If further progress was made towards Podziaca, he intended to also attack the Turzyna Heights, which dominated the battlefield. However, the army command was concerned that such an attack could divert the XXXX1. Reserve Corps from its main thrust direction to the south, and recommended suppressing the Turzyna Heights only with artillery fire from both neighboring corps. While the 82nd Reserve Division managed to advance slightly east of the San during the afternoon, its attack west of the river did not progress well. Opposite the weak Hungarian cavalry riflemen deployed in the area between the 82nd Reserve and 11th Bavarian Infantry Division, the front section from Malkowice was heavily occupied by the enemy. As this posed a threat to the left wing of the fortress attack, the army command instructed General von Francois at 4:45 p.m. to \"advance with emphasis on the western bank while maintaining the current position on the eastern San bank\" and to take the heights of \"Malkowice.\" The 82nd Reserve was overrun at 8:30 p.m., and Wisznia was also named as a further target. However, decisive progress was not achieved on the western bank of the San on May 30. The Austro-Hungarian VI, Guard, and X Army Corps were able to further expand their defensive positions. The two guard battalions withdrawn to Jaroslaw were moved to Dunlowice out of consideration for the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, weakened in its combat strength.

      "In the attack sector of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division, on the morning of May 31, the infantry that had moved into assault positions found the effect of the artillery fire still insufficient. Therefore, the assault was postponed to June 1, and the effective firing on the intended breakthrough point continued. The 82nd Reserve Division, joining on the left, was engaged in heavy offensive combat west of the San in the morning, attempting to wrest the farmsteads \"at Malkowice\" from the enemy and to advance southward from Walawa. In this situation, at 2:50 in the afternoon, the Army High Command received an order from the Austro-Hungarian High Command which, referring to the concerning developments at Sieniawa and the enemy force concentrations there, ordered the following: \"11th and 4th Armies are to ensure particularly strong establishment of their battle lines and prepare all dispensable forces as reserves for defense. 3rd and 2nd Armies are to continue the attack on Przemysl and against the Przemysl—Rudki line with all determination.\" The 11th Army High Command interpreted this as the certainly understandable wish of the Austro-Hungarian High Command to recapture the fortress, lost in March despite brave defense, through forces of their own armies. However, it believed it could not comply with this request in the current operational situation, as a sudden abandonment by the 11th Army of the attack on Przemysl and the thrust from the north into the rear of the fortress threatened to bring the entire offensive operation to a standstill — all the more so when shortly afterward news arrived that the allies had given up Fort VII, which had been taken the previous evening. Fully aware of his responsibility, Colonel General von Mackensen refrained from modifying his previous orders. This found its quick and brilliant justification through the behavior of the troops entrusted with the attack on Przemysl.\n",
      "The new bombardment of the attack front, which lasted until 4 o'clock in the afternoon, was visibly having the greatest effect. The last lucky shot from a 42 cm mortar had shattered the remains of a dangerous trench flank on the western side of Fort XI. Recognizing these favorable circumstances, the assault infantry, beginning from the left flank, advanced from their positions on their own initiative.</body>\n",

      "<body>The attack infantry, beginning from the left wing, advanced from their position on their own initiative. The assault was completely successful. The fort line Xa to XI was taken. The surprised Russians had mostly been unable to occupy the parapets in time. Their isolated counterattacks were repelled and numerous prisoners were taken. The attack, immediately carried forward across the Ring Road, reached the heights between Fort X and Dunkowiczki by 5 o'clock in the afternoon. The first, most important step toward capturing the fortress had thus been taken. As support, General von Kneußl was provided with the two Guard battalions stationed at Dunkowice. The next day, the artillery was to prepare for the expansion of the breakthrough to the east. The advance of the adjoining 82nd Reserve Division was essential for this. The Army High Command therefore demanded at 5:45 PM that the XXXI Reserve Corps deploy all available forces to immediately \"secure the coverage of the Bavarian division between Malkowice and the San.\" The artillery of the XXXI Reserve Corps was to be positioned against the fort line Dunkowiczki—Bolestraszyce. All other tasks of the corps, except for the artillery bombardment of the railway at Medyka, were to take a back seat to this. Accordingly, the attack group of the 82nd Reserve Division fighting in front of the \"at Malkowice\" farmsteads was also reinforced with infantry and artillery from the eastern bank, to be able to continue the attack with full force the following morning.\n",
      "At the front of the 11th Army east of the San, the expected strong enemy attacks did not materialize.\n",
      "To ensure more unified combat leadership than before at the common attack front of the 5th, 3rd, and 2nd Armies, the Beskiden Corps was subordinated to the 2nd Army. The attack here was planned for June 2nd.\n",
      "Enemy intelligence revealed that the Russian force shift to the northeast had also led to a new organization of their front. The Russian 8th Army now extended to the Lubaczowka at Nowa Grobla. In Przemysl, three infantry divisions and three Landwehr brigades were assumed to be present, with a further 18 infantry and three cavalry divisions in front of the 11th Army, as well as eleven infantry and three cavalry divisions in front of the 5th and 4th Armies.\n",
      "General von Kneußl devoted all efforts to expanding the breakthrough front in the fort belt on June 1st, which was still too narrow for further advancement southward, to both sides, especially to the east, as this would simultaneously increase pressure against the fortress's connections. The attack of the left wing of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division over Dumkowiczi suffered heavily from flanking fire, as the farmsteads \"at Malkowice\" on the left flank had not yet been taken by the 82nd Reserve Division.</body>\n",

      "During the night, the enemy launched new attacks against the large bridgehead of the 11th Army east of the San, with particular force against the Lubaczowka front. They were repelled. The unengaged right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army was able to consolidate with additional reinforcements. Based on this situation, visible at 9 a.m., Generaloberst von Mackensen attempted to move the reserves located on the left wing of the army over Jaroslau on both banks of the San to the south, to use them if necessary to support the fortress attack or the advance east of the San.\n",
      "At the front of General von Kneussl, the left wing had been able to advance through Dumkowiczi under further heavy fighting. At 5 p.m., the general reported that the enemy could only be pushed back slowly. Meanwhile, the 82nd Reserve Division, supported by artillery from General von Kneussl, had already captured the farms \"at Malkowice\" from the enemy by noon and pursued them up to the height of Dumkowiczi and east of Wysiatycz. The favorable development of the situation prompted General von Francois to inquire with the army command whether the 82nd Reserve Division should now participate in the attack on the fortress. The decision was made at 2:30 p.m. that only \"the effect with heavy artillery against the northern front of the fortress\" and \"securing the flank of the fortress attack\" were the tasks of the division. To make this designation effective, more artillery was brought in from the east bank of the San. The good progress of the 82nd Reserve Division also had to bring significant relief to the left wing of the fortress attack. Around 8 p.m., a work south of Dumkowiczi was stormed by them, and the foreland up to Fort XII was taken.\n",
      "In front of the entire front east of the San, especially in front of the Guard Corps (including the 56th Infantry Division), the enemy had further strengthened.\n",
      "Since the previous artillery preparation for the fortress attack of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army had not been sufficient, the command of the 11th Army suggested at 7 p.m. to expand the advantages gained so far on the northern front of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division by allocating infantry from the 3rd Army, in case a quick success with this army was not expected.</body>\n",

      "After repelling nighttime counter-attacks, the systematic bombardment of Fort X began in the early morning. At noon, the right wing of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division stormed this fort, which had been almost completely destroyed by artillery fire yet was stubbornly defended until the end. With its fall, the foundation was laid for continuing the attack southward. To ensure the security of the left flank, General von Kneußl requested the Army High Command at 2:15 PM to allow the right wing of the XXXXI Reserve Corps to advance further against the fortress, contrary to previous orders. Meanwhile, General von François had already independently ordered this. Thus secured on the left flank, the entire attack front under General von Kneußl could push beyond the village after repelling enemy counter-attacks from Zurawica between 4 and 5 PM. This gave the attack an admittedly concerning width of twelve kilometers, without any reserves available. As hard fighting was expected to continue, the Army High Command considered bringing up additional forces from the XXXXI Reserve Corps. At 7:40 PM, it also repeated its suggestion to direct infantry from the 5th and 3rd Armies to support General von Kneußl's attack. \"If infantry is not pushed into the breakthrough gap of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division tonight, this division will not be able to exploit the success further, but will struggle to hold what has been achieved.\" However, General von Conrad considered the 3rd Army's assault planned for early June 3rd against the fortress's southwest front, whose success was not doubted, to be the most effective support for the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division. Moreover, throughout the day, signs had increased that the enemy was preparing to systematically evacuate the fortress. Early in the morning, airmen had observed columns marching eastward on the Przemyśl—Mosciska road. They had been taken under fire by the 10 cm cannons of the XXXXI Reserve Corps. According to the airmen, the Russian artillery had weakened, with parts of it observed withdrawing. Enemy combat activity on the eastern bank of the San had diminished. Consequently, General von François strove to push further southeast and later attack the Turzyna Heights as well. In response to his inquiry, the Army High Command declared at 12:30 PM: \"Advance on Medyka desired as soon as possible.\" Following this, at 1:30 PM, General von François ordered an advance east of the San in the direction of Torki—Pozdziacz, initially far enough for field artillery to be able to engage the Medyka road. The left corps wing felt its way towards the Turzyna Heights.\n",

The evening aerial reconnaissance confirmed the continuation of the enemy's departure from the fortress and numerous fires, particularly at the Przemyśl train station. The evacuation of the fortress seemed to be in full swing. Therefore, General von Kneussl ordered at 8 p.m. to advance further to the core fortifications and, if possible, to penetrate the city itself, as Major General von Behr had already intended. The artillery opened fire on the core fortifications. The fall of the fortress was only a matter of a few hours.\n",
      "Indeed, the cavalry of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division found the works IX a and IX abandoned by the enemy at midnight on June 3. The other adjacent works north of the San were occupied by cavalry of the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army by 2 a.m. At this time, General von Kneussl, based on reports from his right wing section, assumed that the enemy would no longer hold the inner fort line. He therefore renewed the order at 4 a.m. for the right section of Major General von Schöch to advance into the city center. The left attack section under Major General von Behr, from whom no reports were yet available, was to immediately advance eastward past the fortress over the San to capture the enemy withdrawing from the fortress if possible. At 5:15 a.m., however, the report from Major General von Behr reached the army command directly, stating that Przemyśl had been occupied by his troops at 3 a.m. A guard battalion made available to General von Behr had advanced through the inner fortifications during the night and found the city abandoned by the enemy. General von Kneussl received this report only at 6 a.m., simultaneously with an aerial report that the last Russian infantry had been observed an hour earlier near Przekpana east of Przemyśl and from Torit marching towards Medyka. Further east, long infantry and vehicle columns were moving south of the main road to the east. General von Kneussl now set all his troops on the shortest route over Przemyśl in pursuit. Also, the parts of the XXXXI Reserve Corps located on the west bank of the San had joined the advance of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division. At 4:45 a.m., the 82nd Reserve Division had occupied the forts located between Zurawica and the San, abandoned by the enemy, and swung further towards the San east of Przemyśl.</body>\n",

      "As the inner wings of the 11th and Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army threatened to converge in and around Przemysl, it was necessary to make arrangements for the continuation of operations. At 8 in the morning, the Army High Command ordered the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division to advance to the eastern belt of the fortress and the XXXI Reserve Corps to reach the San south of Bolestraszyce and the line Fort I—Tuzna Heights. The Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army began a rightward swing of its left wing through Przemysl. By noon, the Austro-Hungarian X Corps moved into the city south of the San. In the evening, the lines of the allies stood on and on both sides of the heights of Siedliska. The line Medyka—Bucow was agreed upon as the boundary between the two armies. Up to this line, the XXXI Reserve Corps swung forward at Medyka. Fort I and Poplazka were free from the enemy. The left wing of the corps prepared for an attack against the still occupied Tuzna Heights in the afternoon. At 3 in the afternoon, it was stormed after a hard fight. The enemy still held at the Wisznia and in Starzawa. The expected large counteroffensive against the front of the 11th Army further north did not materialize.\n",
      "The situation for the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army was still tense. The enemy that had broken in at Lezajsk could not be completely thrown back over the San. An attack seemed to be preparing against the new front southwest of Rudnik. The German 47th Reserve Division of Lieutenant General von Besser was already heavily, but unsuccessfully, attacked on both sides of the Leg. The reserves of the 4th Army were exhausted on the extended front. Following a suggestion from Field Marshal von Mackensen, the Austro-Hungarian High Command decided to immediately transfer the left wing corps of the 3rd Army, the X Corps, to the 4th Army.</body>\n",

The capture of the fortress, whether by surprise or by planned attack, was the task of the neighboring Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army. Moreover, this army was also to initially focus on cooperating with the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army in the area southeast of Przemysl.\n",
      "The objective for the 11th Army was indeed that Generaloberst von Mackensen should concentrate as strong forces as possible in the center for the advance over the San near Jaroslaw and also entrust his weakly held right wing only with defensive flank protection against the fortress. The first impetus for a change in this task came on May 18 from the suggestion of General von Falkenhayn to break through from the bridgehead taken at Jaroslaw to the southeast on both sides of the Wisznia. At that time, there was no intention of an attack by the right wing of the 11th Army against the northern front of the fortress, but rather to cut their rear connections and to relieve the allied armies on the right, whose offensive had almost come to a standstill. However, as much as Generaloberst von Mackensen was also eager to place the main thrust of this suggestion in a southeasterly direction towards Mosciska, it could not be avoided that his right wing now came into close contact with the fortress. Initially, it was believed that they could still limit themselves to closing off its northern front. However, the strong resistance encountered by the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division assigned to this task made Generaloberst von Mackensen find the reinforcement of the XXXXI Reserve Corps, with the cooperation of the 119th Infantry Division, more desirable. From the limited progress of the right neighboring army both against Przemysl itself and in the advance against the area east of it, it then emerged, albeit not inevitably, but understandably, the decision to quickly bring down the fortress by attacking its northern front. To ensure success, the army leader also believed that he could not do without at least indirect support from the XXXXI Reserve Corps. As a result, a considerable part of the original strength of the thrust against the rear connections was lost. To compensate for this and to sharpen the delivery of other objectives, consideration for the precarious situation into which the left neighboring army had simultaneously fallen forbade it. To relieve the northern flank of the 11th Army in this process, even insignificant parts had to be sent to the Francois assault group.</body>\n",

The shortening of the front freed up forces for other uses. Besides this operational advantage, the fall of Przemysl also represented a new, highly significant moral success for the allied armies.</body>\n",

      "However, as the 38th Infantry Division, in conjunction with the 40th, succeeded in wresting the heights east of Drohobycza from the enemy early on the morning of May 20, it was initially left with the Szurmay Group to exploit this success, and only when the follow-up attack by both divisions came to a halt in front of a new Russian position the following day was it withdrawn and positioned northwest of Uliczno.\n",
      "Based on extensive reconnaissance, General von Linsingen intended to deliver the decisive blow to break through the enemy front at Stryj. On May 23, he commissioned the Bothmer Corps, to which the army reserves were made available.</body>\n",

      "<body>Corps Bothmer, to which the army reserves were made available. It was to attack comprehensively with strong wings on both sides and, after capturing Stryj, roll up the fronts to the north and south. Corps Gerok was to take Dolina; the parts of the Austro-Hungarian 19th Infantry Division stationed east of the Czeczwa were withdrawn behind the river to the area of Spas, as their right flank was threatened by Russian troop concentrations near and south of Krasna due to the strong detachment of the 7th Army. Corps Hofsmann was to advance eastward on the left bank of the Swica in the direction of Sokolow, while Group Szurmay, with a strong right wing, was to storm the enemy positions east of Zydaczow and roll up the enemy to the north. The attack was to begin at dawn on May 26, with the 24th and 25th used for the strongest artillery preparation. General von Falkenhayn attached particular importance to its rapid execution up to a full decision, in view of Italy's entry into the war.\n",
      "However, the Southern Army again encountered such stubborn resistance everywhere that significant successes were achieved nowhere. The division Puttkamer (reinforced 95th Reserve Infantry Brigade and Austrian 12th Landsturm Territorial Brigade) deployed on the right wing of Corps Bothmer east of the Lipowice—Stryj railway was unable to take the particularly strong Russian position here on May 26 despite unfavorable conditions and suffered heavy losses. The 38th Infantry Division attacking in the direction of Stupnica (German composite Brigade Kumme and Hungarian 75th Infantry Brigade) penetrated the forests west of Holobutow but soon came to a halt before new, heavily barricaded trenches on the Holobutow—Gaje woynze line. The continuation of the attack on May 27 also yielded no better results. The enemy was even able to retake a stronghold southeast of Turza mala captured the previous day from Corps Gerok in a counterattack. The attempt to break through the enemy front at Stryj with a comprehensive attack by both wings of Corps Bothmer had to be considered a failure for the time being. Its repetition offered little prospect of success on the right wing in the difficult mountain forest between the Sufiel and the Stryj. On the other hand, more favorable conditions seemed to prevail for the left wing. Therefore, it was to attack again after reinforcement by a brigade of the 1st Infantry Division as well as heavy and heaviest artillery. In the meantime, the infantry had to work closer to the enemy with saps. On the evening of May 29, the Pächern Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division was ready behind the 3rd Guard Infantry Division. Early on the 31st, it was to break through the enemy front at Zawadown near Holobutow and take Stryj.</body>\n",

Attacked again on the entire front during the night of the 30th and broken through south of Bolechow at 4 a.m., the corps abandoned its positions and retreated to the heights on both sides of Bolechow. Field Marshal Lieutenant Hofsmann believed he could not even hold this line securely with his severely shaken troops and requested reinforcement by five to six battalions during the day.\n",
      "General von Linsingen faced the question of whether to withdraw these forces from Corps Bothmer and thus forgo the decision sought at Stryj or to carry out the intended attack regardless of the situation at Corps Hofsmann. He decided on the latter, on the suggestion of General Count von Bothmer, considering that it was by no means certain whether the enemy would continue to attack at all, and if he did, whether he would succeed. He ordered Corps Hofsmann not only to hold its positions but to regain the lost ground through attack. Corps Gerok, which had to bend its left wing back to the northern exit of Kniasioluka due to the events at Corps Hofsmann, was instructed not to join the retrograde movements of its neighbor but to bring the enemy to a standstill through counterattack and to support the ordered advance of Corps Hofsmann with all its might. General von Linsingen reported to the Austro-Hungarian High Command that the enemy, according to a just-received report from the 7th Army, was making movements to the west, and that the Southern Army could only continue its offensive successfully if the 7th Army tied down the opposing Russian 9th Army through attack. General von Conrad then ordered the 7th Army to attack with its left wing \"to prevent any withdrawal of enemy forces at all costs.\" Late in the evening, General von Pflanzer-Baltin informed the Southern Army that his left wing would advance over the Pasieczna—Siniowt line on May 31.\n",
      "The bold decision of General von Linsingen was met with complete success. After 1¾ hours of artillery preparation escalating to the strongest drumfire, the reinforced 3rd Guard Infantry Division broke out of their trenches at 5:45 a.m. on May 31 and in the first assault took all enemy positions from Quitliby to southwest of Stupnica. Over 5000 prisoners and eight guns fell into their hands. Hot on the heels of the fleeing enemy, the right attack group pushed through Stryj to the eastern and northern edges of the city, where hastily brought-up Russian reserves initially offered resistance.</body>\n",

The left attack group drove the enemy back over the railway to Zaplatyn and over the Niezachowka stream, but could not achieve the day's objective, the line Dobrany—Brigidan. On the right wing of the 38th Infantry Division, the Kumme Brigade, which had followed the retreating enemy to Stupnica, was met south of this village by a Russian mass attack, which could only be repelled after prolonged, particularly bitter fighting. On the left wing of the division and in front of the Szurmay group, the enemy held their position with great tenacity. Only a stronghold southeast of Gaje could be wrested from them by the 40th Infantry Division by evening. No change occurred on the right army wing. The continuation of the enemy offensive feared by the Hofmann Corps did not occur. The left wing of the 7th Army advanced with 24 battalions of the Schönburg group¹ into the area on both sides of Manastur and south and west of Majdan, where they encountered stubborn resistance and suffered heavy losses. In the afternoon, a fierce Russian counterattack from Majdan forced the entire group to retreat to their starting positions.\n",
      "An order received from Teschen at 2 p.m. outlined once again the task assigned to the right army wing. According to it, the Southern Army was to \"secure further advances against the Dniester near Kolodrub and Nikolajow and continue the attack in an easterly direction.\" The 7th Army was to join from the left wing, which was directed towards Stanislau.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the left wing of the 7th Army, which had been pushed back to its starting positions, had to fend off heavy Russian attacks, especially east of the Dyl and southwest of Majdan. The enemy also probed with stronger forces in the gap between the Lomnica and Iezcowa valleys on the right wing of the Southern Army. The indentation of the breakthrough at Stryj on June 1 was not yet noticeable among the enemies facing the Gerok and Hofmann Corps and the 1st Infantry Division. The Russians still held their positions strongly occupied here. However, the left army wing was able to make further, in part very considerable, progress.

The enemy had already withdrawn from the 38th Infantry Division during the night. Advancing over Brigidau—Kamfno, the division reached Königsa.u at 2 p.m. At the same time, the 40th Infantry Division, still partially engaged in heavy fighting, reached the line Lasowzy—Slonisko. The enemy held its position firmly against the 7th Infantry Division. As the further advance of the 38th Infantry Division seemed to offer the possibility of completely cutting off parts of the northern flank of the Russian 11th Army, this division and the left flank of the 7th were deployed at noon on Horucko. Shortly thereafter, the 2nd Army announced that the right flank of the 14th Infantry Division (five battalions and 1½ batteries) stationed at Woloszca, as well as the Austro-Hungarian 1st Cavalry Division under Major General Baron von Leonhardi, had been ordered to advance on Medenice to block the retreat of the enemy facing the 7th Infantry Division. General von Linsingen, like these forces temporarily subordinated to him by the Austro-Hungarian army command, was also directed towards Horucko in the army order at 11 p.m. The 38th and 40th Infantry Divisions, which were attacking new enemy positions in the Hofeszberg—Opary line in the evening, were to continue their advance northward. The army high command hoped that the right flank of the Russian 11th Army would be destroyed by the next morning. Then the 38th Infantry Division was to be advanced southeast for an attack over the Stryj, with the Szurmay group following, secured against the Dniester on the left.\n",
      "However, the encirclement of the Russians did not succeed. The 38th and 40th Infantry Divisions did push the enemy back north in the early morning hours of June 2nd, but the 7th Infantry Division allowed them to withdraw unhindered just in time, and the Leonhardi group only arrived west of Lady at 2 a.m., far too late to cut off the enemy south of the Dniester. The Szurmay group was tasked with quickly clearing the southern bank of the Dniester of the enemy, securing it with a brigade of the 7th Infantry Division and the infantry of the Leonhardi group from Nadiatycze to the Bystrzyca estuary, and taking possession of Mikolajow and the crossing at Kolodruby. The rest of the 7th and the 40th Infantry Divisions were to be assembled at Medenice—Hofeszberg.

Field Marshal Lieutenant Szurmay deployed the majority of his forces, including the entire Leondardi group, for an attack, but was only able to wrest Horucko from the enemy on that day. General von Linsingen disagreed with this use of the 1st Cavalry Division; he again ordered their advance on Derzow. However, the division could only be withdrawn from the front after nightfall; consequently, it only reached the area around Krynica, where the 71st Infantry Brigade of the 7th Infantry Division, tasked with securing the Dniester on both sides of the Stryj—Lemberg railway, had also arrived.\n",
      "The command of the 2nd Army objected to the extensive deployment of the 1st Cavalry Division to Derzow. They wanted the southern edge of the marshland (Wielkie Bloto) from Serziskow to Bialin to be secured by the 1st Cavalry Division, as they had no more forces available for this. However, the Austro-Hungarian military command decided to keep the division with the Southern Army and assigned the 2nd Army the task of securing the southern edge of the Wielkie Bloto up to the area around Woloszcza. The 38th Infantry Division had marched southeast in the morning, assuming that the 40th Infantry Division had reached Horucko. They reached Wozwonia via Kawko. The left wing of the 3rd Guards Infantry Division captured Lisatycze and Nawoyczah on the afternoon of June 2nd and entered Lesjawor at night. Their right wing and the left of the 1st Infantry Division (Hungarian 76th Infantry Brigade) made only slight progress on the eastern bank of the Stryj. The enemy still stood in full strength before the Hofmann and Gerok corps.\n",
      "On June 3rd, the situation to the right of the Stryj remained unchanged. Although retreating movements behind the enemy front were observed by aircraft to a greater extent than before, the enemy stubbornly and successfully resisted the attacks of the left wing of the 1st Infantry Division, reinforced by the 95th Reserve Infantry Brigade during the night, and the right of the 3rd Guards Infantry Division. The left wing guard of the 3rd Guards Infantry Division and the Hungarian 38th Infantry Division pushed the Russians further northeast and then crossed the Stryj at Kawyczat and Chodowicze, where the parts of the enemy still holding south of the river were now to be rolled up from the north. The Hungarians thus moved into the gap between the previously separated fighting parts of the 3rd Guards Infantry Division. They prepared for an evening attack on the heavily fortified Gelsenhofer Heights; the left wing of the guard fought its way to Ruda and secured its left flank.</body>\n",

      "For some time, before this result came within reach, General von Falkenhayn, in view of the slow progress of events on the Galician front in the second half of May, had been considering the mobilization of reinforcements. The decision of where to obtain these forces was not easy. The three divisions newly formed in the area of the Eastern Commander-in-Chief — 101st, 103rd, 105th Infantry Division — had just been sent to southern Hungary (from May 24) at the urging of General von Conrad, to be used from there as needed against Italy or Serbia. The Austro-Hungarian Chief of Staff opposed General von Falkenhayn's wish to now bring these divisions to the front north of the Carpathians, arguing that he did not rule out a Serbian attack on Syrmia or Bosnia.\n",
      "Therefore, there was no choice but to further weaken the front of the Eastern Commander-in-Chief. Already on May 23, General von Falkenhayn had explained to General Ludendorff, who had been summoned to Pleß for a verbal discussion, that major operations in the area of the Eastern Commander-in-Chief were not currently feasible.</body>\n",

      "<body>Falkenhayn explained to General Ludendorff, who was summoned to Pleß for verbal discussions, that large operations in the area of the Eastern Commander-in-Chief were not currently feasible1). The desire to maintain the current front line had to be reconciled with the necessity of withdrawing additional troops for the disposal of the Supreme Army Command. Following the proposals made by General Ludendorff, on May 25, Field Marshal von Hindenburg communicated that the general war situation absolutely required the provision of army reserves on a large scale. For this purpose, five divisions were to be gradually freed from his command area2). Thus, these forces were not immediately available for the Galician theater of war. The Supreme Army Command initially reserved the right to deploy a division of the 9th Army, relocated on June 3 — the Eastern Commander-in-Chief designated the 22nd Infantry Division for this — and the newly forming 107th Infantry Division, whose formation in Thorn was to be completed in early June.\n",
      "Withdrawing forces from the Western Front seemed risky given the still tense situation there3). Nevertheless, General von Falkenhayn decided on June 1 to take the risk of deploying the XXII Reserve Corps (without the 85th Reserve Infantry Brigade) and the temporarily withdrawn 8th Bavarian Reserve Division from the front to the east4). This ultimately succeeded in making a total of fourteen and a half infantry divisions available as reinforcements for the continuation of the offensive operation in the theater of war north of the Carpathians.\n",
      "Initially, opinions differed on the point of deployment. General von Falkenhayn expected less impact from an immediate reinforcement of the troops fighting in Galicia than from their indirect support through the deployment of fresh forces at the front north of the Vistula in the command area of Colonel General von Woyrsch. After verbal consultation with his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant Colonel von Heyde, he expressed himself on this matter in a letter to the Eastern Commander-in-Chief on May 28 as follows5):\n",
      "\"... The situation in Galicia is not very promising. Given the low offensive power of our allies and the enemy's daily increasing superiority, we are facing the danger of a complete standstill there sooner or later, which is now even more concerning for us after Italy's intervention, than it was before.</body>\n",

Only through the use of an extraordinary amount of blood and ammunition would success be conceivable. However, we have every reason to be economical with both. It is more feasible to consider an operation against the parts of the enemy front weakened by the withdrawal of units, to bring indirect relief. Since the Narew front plays no role in this connection, as any offensive there can easily be brought to a standstill by weaker forces at the swamp section, as General Ludendorff also mentioned in his discussion with me, only the Vistula front south of the Pilica comes into question. In the deployment of reinforcements at any other location, he also saw an \"irreparable loss of time\"). In my opinion, there is no doubt that an engagement of three to four fresh divisions could break through the enemy Russian line there, bring it to a complete falter, and probably reach the right Vistula bank downstream of the San estuary simultaneously with the enemy. This would also make the San line untenable for the Russians. The deployment of the four divisions could occur relatively quickly and unexpectedly...\n",
      "The Commander-in-Chief East agreed to these statements on the same day in a factual sense, but declared himself unable to provide new forces beyond the assignments already imposed on him.\n",
      "From the written statement of the Army High Command 9 received on May 29, it emerged that this considered a breakthrough over Ditrowice against the bridgeheads of Dembno and Jozefow to the Vistula possible with a reinforcement of three infantry and one cavalry division, but regarded the continuation of the thrust beyond the river until effective relief of the Galician front, considering the expected flank threat from Iwangorod, as doubtful. Lieutenant Colonel Heye also represented this standpoint the following day in a discussion in Plesz. Contrary to the view of General von Falkenhayn, the Chief of the Operations Department, Colonel Tappen, considered the deployment of reinforcements with the victorious 11th Army here more dispensable than in the command area of Generaloberst von Woyrsch. He emphasized that the Russians in Galicia, although they had significantly increased in number, were already greatly demoralized under the paralyzing impression of their previous defeats and could be most decisively struck here.</body>\n",

      "A third possibility was envisioned by the Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff. Although he had acknowledged the necessity of weakening the Russian offensive power through further strikes in Galicia in a discussion with General von Falkenhayn on May 21 in Teschen, he stated in writing on May 23 that the desire to \"settle accounts with the Russian forces as extensively as possible\" must find its limit in the most urgent demand \"not to allow the Italians to advance into those areas, the loss of which would vitally affect the monarchy and make the conduct of the war altogether impossible, thus deciding the war in favor of our opponents.\" In this fundamental position, General von Conrad was not averse to refraining from more extensive operations on the theater of war north of the Carpathians and to be content with achieving and securing the previously sought operational objective, the San-Wisznia-Dniester line. At the moment, it seemed most important to him to immediately support the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, which had gotten into a difficult situation due to the successful counterattack of the Russians at Sieniawa. Even in the event of continuing the offensive over San and Wisznia, he promised himself the greatest success if emphasis was placed on the advance of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, as he believed that the Grodek fortress would pose extraordinary difficulties to an attack. Therefore, in a discussion with General von Falkenhayn on May 30 in Pleß, he suggested the deployment of reinforcements for this army.\n",
      "On the same day, Colonel Tappen was sent to the 11th Army High Command in Jaroslaw to obtain its opinion. Colonel General von Mackensen and his Chief of Staff shared the same view as the Chief of the Operations Department, despite the currently undecided battle situation on the San and Wisznia front. In his written statement of May 31, the Commander-in-Chief of the 11th Army argued against the deployment of reinforcements at the Bojowitsch Army Division, stating that an offensive there would come to a halt at the latest after a successful crossing of the Vistula in front of quickly assembled Russian forces and thus would have no effect on the Dniester front. It was then literally stated: \"A thrust over Jaroslaw will bring about the intended effect more quickly. It has to deal not with a fortified river barrier, but only with the enemy facing the 4th and 11th Armies.\"</body>\n",

However, the troops of the 11th Army compensate for this with efficiency and can also be reinforced like the 4th Army by troops that will be freed upon the imminent fall of Przemysl and by divisions made available domestically. A thrust over Jaroslau in the general direction of Rawa Ruska is promising if the 4th Army protects the left flank of the 11th and the right Austrian neighboring army allows the enemy standing along the Grodeker Seemeife to break out of its position. Both will be achievable with the existing and the newly anticipated forces, provided that the leader of the 11th Army is allowed to exert direct influence on both neighboring armies.\"\n",
      "When Colonel Tappen returned with this position of Generaloberst von Mackensen on the evening of May 31 in Plesz, it was already known there that the first forts of the Przemysl fortress had been stormed and that the Southern Army had taken Stryj. General von Falkenhayn saw in this promising signs of a favorable development of events in Galicia. He therefore decided on June 2, in accordance with the proposal of Colonel Tappen and the position of Generaloberst von Mackensen, to deploy reinforcements with the 11th Army. The Supreme Commander East received orders to transport the 22nd Infantry Division (from June 2 from Lodz, the 107th Infantry Division (from June 5 from Thorn). The deployment of reinforcements from the Western Front also began on June 2. The Austro-Hungarian Army Command was informed that starting June 4, four and a half infantry divisions along with heavy artillery would arrive via the railways over Debica and Jaslo to Rzeszow. \"These divisions,\" it was said, \"are intended to carry out operations against the enemy located east of the San until a decision sufficient for our purposes is achieved.\" The communication to the Army High Command 11 was drafted in almost the same wording.\n",
      "To the Southern Army, whose left wing repelled the enemy against the Dniester on June 2, the following telegram was sent: \"The brilliant course of operations of the Southern Army yesterday and today will hopefully have significant consequences. They could be further enhanced if it proves possible to soon bring a column to the northern Dniester bank and advance downstream there.\"</body>\n",

      "On June 3 at 8:30 in the morning, immediately after the capture of Przemyśl, the Army High Command 11 presented its intentions for the continuation of operations to the allied military commands. It initially proposed the dissolution of the k.u.k. 3rd Army concentrated in the Przemyśl area. The X and XVII Corps were to be transferred to the k.u.k. 4th Army, the German Beskiden Corps to the k.u.k. 2nd Army, and the incoming reinforcements were to be assigned to the 11th Army. Generaloberst von Mackensen requested joint command over all three armies. The initial plan was to have parts of the 11th Army advance north from the bridgehead to facilitate the 4th Army's right wing crossing the San at Sieniawa. After the reinforcements arrived, the continuation of the 11th Army's offensive was planned in deep formation from the line Starzawa—Molodzyce via Starzyska—Rawa Ruska, bypassing the Grodek sector to the north, to encircle it. The 2nd Army was to cover the right flank of the 11th Army by advancing from the line Chlopycze—Mosziska against the line Komarno—Janow, while the same task was assigned to the left flank of the 4th Army. This was to advance with two corps on Rudka (20 kilometers northeast of Lubaczow)—Narol Miasto, with two corps covering the Tanew sector, and the rest covering the San-Vistula triangle.\n",
      "The allied general staff chiefs agreed in a discussion on the afternoon of June 3 in Plesz with these intentions of the Army High Command 11 and also agreed that the South Army should continue the attack with its main forces in a southeasterly direction against the right flank of the enemy facing the beleaguered k.u.k. 7th Army. On June 4, the new orders were issued. They essentially stated: \"Generaloberst von Mackensen with the 11th Army and the still incoming troops continues the thrust south of the Tanew to decisively defeat the enemy facing him. The 2nd Army joins this advance on the right and subsequently takes over the protection of the right flank, the 4th Army the protection of the advance on the northern flank... To ensure influence in this operation, the 4th and 2nd Armies are placed under the orders of Generaloberst von Mackensen for the duration. The South Army advances south of the Dniester against the enemy forces facing the right wing of the 7th Army, to finally defeat the enemy standing south of the Dniester in conjunction with this. It also takes over the security at the Dniester.\"\n",

      "<body>The orders from the Austro-Hungarian High Command on June 4 for the German South Army aligned completely with the intentions of its leader, General von Linsingen. He had already reported to the High Command in Teschen on June 3 that his army would launch an attack the next day along its entire front — with the left wing from the line Strzałow—Chodowice—Potkowce — in a southeasterly direction to roll up the enemy before the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army. He had requested the subordination of the left wing of this army under his command. In his rejecting response, General von Conrad stated that the 7th Army was currently being heavily attacked by the enemy and needed all its forces, but that after repelling the enemy's advance, it would forcefully engage in the South Army's offensive.\n",
      "After a fourteen-day pause in fighting, the Russian 9th Army had resumed its attack against the center of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army on June 2. While it had only temporarily reached the southern bank of the Pruth east of Kolomea and near Lanczyn, it had managed to establish a firm foothold south of Sadzawka. Through continued advances, it sought to gain ground here on June 3 towards Mühlbächen. The commander of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, General of Cavalry Freiherr von Pflanzer-Baltin, deployed all available army reserves to the Czbulla group, which was striving to seal off the enemy incursion in fierce defensive combat. As the situation significantly escalated in the afternoon, an offensive by the left wing had to be temporarily abandoned.\n",
      "Thus, the South Army was initially on its own. The withdrawal of forces from the front opposite the Gerok and Hofmann corps to the north, observed by aircraft on June 3, also gave hope here for a rapid weakening of enemy resistance. General von Linsingen therefore instructed both corps in the army order issued late in the evening to \"turn any beginning retreat of the enemy into a rout through swift and vigorous pursuit.\" The Bothmer corps was to continue its comprehensive attack against the enemy's right wing south of the Dniester, the Austro-Hungarian 1st Cavalry Division was to advance over Snjatyn to Kuty, and the Surzman group was to defend along the Dniester from Nadiatkow to Kolodrub and with the Hungarian 40th Infantry Division Derzow.</body>\n",

      "<body>Indeed, the enemy abandoned his positions south of Stryj early on the morning of June 4 and retreated eastward. The corps of Gerok and Hofmann, as well as the 1st Infantry Division, followed him in a broad front without initially encountering serious resistance. However, the enemy sought to prevent further advances by the Hungarian 38th Infantry Division, which had taken the Gelsendorf Heights at dawn, and the 3rd Guards Infantry Division, which was pressing from Ruda on Noweziolo against his retreat routes, at all costs. Against the left flank of the Guards, he launched a deeply echeloned mass attack from Zablotowce, which was repelled but succeeded in allowing the Russian forces retreating north of the Swica to escape into the bridgehead of Zurawno. For further pursuit, General von Linsingen assigned Kalusz to the Gerok Corps and Wierzchnia to the Hofmann Corps as daily objectives. The Bothmer Corps was to quickly seize the Dniester crossing at Zurawno, and the 1st Cavalry Division, which had reached Lowczyce by morning on its march to its original target Rechow, was now to cross the Dniester at Holeszow. The 40th Infantry Division, detached from the Szurmay Group's line of battle, was to reach Hnizdyczow today, while the rest of the Szurmay Group was to take over the Dniester security between Hnizdyczow and Tersatzow.\n",
      "However, these daily objectives were not achieved anywhere. Oppressive heat and heavy dust development on poor roads made the marches extremely strenuous. The Gerok Corps encountered stronger enemy forces east of Holyn in the evening, and the Hofmann Corps at Radowna and Zawada. From the Bothmer Corps, the 1st Infantry Division reached the Swica near and upwards of Lachowice. The Hungarian 38th and the 3rd Guards Infantry Division drove the Russians before them into Zurawno but could no longer seize the bridgehead; the left wing of the Guards took Zablotowce, and their right attack group, which had previously been engaged against the heights southeast of Stryj¹), was drawn to Ruda. The 1st Cavalry Division bivouacked in Zablotowce and Hnizdyczow; their reconnaissance units directed at Hnizdyczow encountered enemies everywhere south of the Dniester. Against the parts of the Szurmay Group remaining west of Stryj, the enemy continued his demonstrative advances, and Horucko fell back into his hands; in the afternoon, he advanced on both sides of the road to Stryj. Field Marshal Lieutenant Szurmay feared a stronger attack and deployed parts of the 40th Infantry Division, which were on the march to Hnizdyczow, for defense.\n",

      "General von Linsingen had already issued the order to the 7th Army at 5 o'clock in the morning to join the advance of the Southern Army from the left flank. Although the enemy had continued his heavy attacks south of Sadzawka throughout the night and had broken through here at 4 o'clock in the morning, and although General von Pflanzer-Baltin now saw himself forced to also rely on the reserves of the groups Marschall, Krautwald, and Rhemen to restore the situation, he relentlessly pushed the groups Rhemen and Schönburg to attack in a northeasterly direction upon the news that the right flank of the Southern Army intended to reach Kalusz today. While a relief attack led by the inner flank of the groups Czbulla and Rhemen on the northern Pruth bank in the direction of Lanczyn failed due to strong Russian resistance and the group Rhemen otherwise gained only little ground, the group Schönburg advanced to the line Maniava—south of Perehinsko. However, here they encountered such stubborn resistance the following day that they were unable to make further progress. A Russian counterattack west of Majdan even pushed the attacker back a bit. Meanwhile, the situation of the group Czbulla had further deteriorated. The enemy continuously brought new forces into the fight and was able to expand his breakthrough despite desperate resistance from the defender. During the course of June 5th, he gained a foothold in Modiatyn. General von Pflanzer-Baltin had already made all available forces of the other groups available to Lieutenant Field Marshal Czbulla, besides the army reserve. He did not consider further weakening of the army's eastern flank appropriate. A quick relief from the now stalled offensive of his left army flank was also not to be expected. It could only be brought about by the favorable progress of the Southern Army's operations. In this situation, General von Pflanzer-Baltin therefore saw in the early afternoon hours the need to intervene, if possible, with parts of the southern flank directly in the direction of and beyond Bohorodczany.\n",
      "General von Linsingen had designated the line Majdan (northwest of Stanislau)—Bukaczowce as the day's objective for his army on June 5th. He expected a decisive success from an advance into the rear of the enemy opposing the 7th Army Pflanzer and therefore ordered the Gerok Corps on the morning of June 5th to \"not be deterred by any considerations for the lagging flank of the 7th Army from proceeding as quickly as possible towards Stanislau.\"</body>\n",

However, the Gerok Corps was no longer able to break the enemy resistance east and north of Holyn on June 5. The Hofsmann Corps also initially made no progress. It was only in the afternoon that it was able to overcome the Russian positions on the heights on both sides of Zawadka and gain ground to the east in immediate pursuit. As a result, the enemy also turned further south on both sides of the Lomnica during the night. However, on the western banks of Nowica, Kalusz, Kopanita, and Tomaszowce, the Gerok and Hofsmann Corps encountered new stubborn resistance the next day, the suppression of which extended in part into the early morning hours of June 7. South of the Swica and the Dniester, the 1st Infantry Division followed the retreating enemy on June 5 and 6 to Dolzka and Slope. The 38th Infantry and 3rd Guard Infantry Divisions entered the stubbornly defended Zurawno on the evening of the 5th and advanced in extremely bitter, costly street fighting to the Dniester. Parts of both divisions followed the fleeing enemy at dawn on June 6 across two makeshift bridges that he had not destroyed in time to the opposite bank, where heavy fire from the hills forced them to dig in. In the afternoon, the enemy's counteraction subsided, and the enemy seemed to be withdrawing. The allies climbed the steep heights and entrenched themselves on both sides of Bakowzin. The left wing of the Guard fought for the crossing at Holeszow at noon. In the afternoon, the 1st Cavalry Division completed the river crossing at Zurawno.\n",
      "On June 7, the offensive by the Gerok, Hofsmann, and Bothmer Corps was to continue southeast towards Stanislau, Jezupol, and Halicz. The protection of the left flank of the Bothmer Corps was to be taken over by the 40th Infantry Division, which had been brought up to Humara in the last two days and was now to advance via Zurawno to the Nowosielce railway station. Reconnaissance to the north up to the Rohatyn—Chodorow railway was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division.\n",
      "While the right wing of the army south of the Dniester advanced during the day with lighter fighting to Majdan, Kudlatowka, and down the Swica section to Wojnilow, the subsequent right march of the 38th Infantry and 3rd Guard Infantry Divisions moved southwest, as heavy resistance on both sides of Nowoszyn had to be broken.</body>\n",

      "<body>General von Linsingen did not initially consider the situation on his northern wing as threatening. He no longer credited the enemy with offensive capability, believing rather that their attacks today were only meant to cover the withdrawal of their main forces to Rohatyn. This view was reinforced by an aerial reconnaissance report, which had observed strong columns marching from Bursztyn and Chodorow toward Rohatyn in the afternoon. The Army High Command apparently attached no particular importance to the recurring reports of recent days about the appearance of the Russian VI Corps, previously deployed on the front west of Warsaw, before the Szurmay Group. They abandoned any continuation of the offensive in a southeastern direction, as there was no longer any prospect of intercepting the Russians retreating before the 7th Army south of the Dniester. Instead, they now wanted to swing their right army wing northeast and north, to lead it across the Dniester between Uscie Zielone and Halicz against the inner flanks of the Russian 9th and 11th Armies. This expressed a new operational concept in the deployment of the Southern Army within the framework of the overall operation, which aimed at concentric cooperation with the armies of Colonel General von Mackensen in the northeastern part of Galicia. For this purpose, the Gerok Corps was deployed to Jeziorko, the Hofmann Corps to Slobodka, and the 1st Infantry Division to Bursztyn. The main forces of the Bothmer Corps were to push back the opposing enemy, while the Szurmay Group, too weak for its own attack, was to maintain a defensive position for the time being.\n",
      "However, this new operational intention did not come to fruition. As General Count von Bothmer had expected, on June 9th the enemy continued its advances against the northern wing of the Southern Army with far superior forces. Before daybreak, they succeeded in breaking through the weak left wing of the Szurmay Group — which counted only 2,400 rifles — at Medenice and Letynia, forcing them to retreat in dissolution to the south and southwest. General von Linsingen, who immediately went to the battlefield to prevent a catastrophe through personal intervention, gained the impression that if the enemy attack continued, which was hardly doubtful, Stryj and thus the only railway line available to the Southern Army would be extremely threatened. He therefore requested the Austro-Hungarian Army Command and the 2nd Army for the temporary assignment of a division to Drohobycz. General of Cavalry von Böhm-Ermolli immediately dispatched the Austro-Hungarian 4th Cavalry Division, reinforced with infantry and artillery, under Major General Berndt to march to Dobrowlany, where it was expected to arrive in the afternoon.</body>\n",

      "<body>General von Linsingen, however, did not consider the movements of the troops under Field Marshal Lieutenant Szurmay sufficient to reliably secure his left flank. This seemed assured to him only if the enemy was pushed back over the Dniester, which could only be achieved by deploying stronger forces. Reserves were not available. The divisions of Bothmer's corps stationed on the northern bank of the Dniester were also engaged in fierce defensive battles since early morning and urgently needed support themselves. Under these circumstances, there was no choice but to refrain from continuing the offensive of the right wing of the army in a northeasterly and northerly direction and to focus on defending what had been achieved, in order to free up his main forces for a counterattack to the northwest. On the morning of June 9, General von Linsingen ordered the Gerok corps, which was engaged in an attack on the heights north of Stanislau, to immediately withdraw to Wojnilow and be ready to continue the march there the next morning. Remaining weak security forces were to be relieved during June 10 by the 5th Cavalry Division, previously used with the Marshal group of the 7th Army, which, along with the German officers of the Marshal group command, had already been made available to General von Linsingen at his request by the Austro-Hungarian army command on June 8 and was advancing from Zablotow via Ottynia towards Stanislau. The Hofmann corps, attacking between the Stryjzau and Lomnica, was to dig in where it stood and relieve the 1st Infantry Division on the left bank of the Lomnica; this division was to march to Zurawno. General Count von Bothmer was also assigned the troops fighting between the Dniester and Stryj, and Field Marshal Lieutenant Szurmay was ordered not to retreat any further and to use the Berndt group offensively. General von Linsingen reported his orders to the allied army commands with the addition: \"Intention: Flanking march and final destruction of the enemy attacking from the north, then offensive north of the Dniester.\" In a second radio message, he pointed out the extremely precarious condition of the 7th and also the 40th Infantry Division, which were no longer capable of sustained defense, let alone being used offensively, and considered the deployment of a German infantry division.\n",
      "General von Conrad, still unaware of these intentions and orders, had expressed in a directive to the 11th, 2nd, Southern, and 7th Armies on the early afternoon of June 9 that the Russian advance against and over the Dniester would neither the attack of the Mackensen group nor the advance of the eastern wing of the Southern Army and that of the 7th Army over the Dniester at and downstream of Halicz be affected, where the enemy apparently was retreating everywhere behind the river.</body>\n",

      "<body>The Mackensen group still affected the advance of the eastern wing of the Southern Army and that of the 7th Army over the Dniester near and downstream of Halicz, where the enemy apparently retreated everywhere behind the river. However, it was necessary to limit the Russian advance over the Dniester and prevent any impact against the right flank of the 2nd and the left of the Southern Army. For this purpose, the 4th Cavalry Division was initially set in motion towards Dobropolany. Furthermore, the 2nd Army was to quickly provide a division on its right wing as an army reserve. However, after General von Conrad received reports from the Southern Army during the afternoon about the cessation of the offensive of its right wing and the intended flank attack in a northwesterly direction, he felt compelled to issue new instructions to the 7th Army. On June 9, it had made further progress in the previous direction of advance to the northeast and stood in the evening with the Korda Corps east of Kosmacz, with the former Marschall group, whose leadership had been taken over by Field Marshal Lieutenant Kaiser, at Jasionow Polny, with the Krautwald Corps southwest of Horodenka, and with the Zibulka, Rhemann, and Schönburg groups attacking enemy rear guard positions on the heights between Obertyn and Ottynia. The 7th Army now received orders to swing north with its main forces and continue its offensive over the Dniester at Buczacz—Maryampol; the right wing (the Korda and Kaiser groups), however, was to move between Pruth and Dniester and from Jalezyczki to west of Liczkowce. While the higher command was striving to locally limit the setback on the left wing of the Southern Army through vigorous intervention and to restore the situation by regrouping the forces, the Böhtmer Corps faced an equally severe crisis. Until the afternoon, it had been possible there to repel the Russian masses, who repeatedly stormed against the trenches of the Allies on the northern Dniester bank, without regard for losses. Also on this side of the river, the advance aimed at Zurawno, therefore particularly threatening, of strong enemy forces could be intercepted by deploying the last German reserves at the northern edge of Mlyniska. However, by 6 in the evening, the 1st Cavalry Division deployed at Wijniow was broken through and thrown back in complete disarray to the Dniester. At the same time, the 38th Infantry Division, located to the right, also gave way and retreated to the southern bank at Kozara and Starawies. Against the thus exposed flank of the 3rd Guards Infantry Division and against the bridge at Zurawno, superior enemy forces advanced irresistibly.

Field Marshal Lieutenant Szurmay was to attack on both flanks and hold his positions in the center. The purpose of the operation, as emphasized by General von Linsingen in the army order issued at 5:30 p.m., was to settle accounts with the enemy before the Szurmay Group and to take the Dniester crossings. The deployment of strong reserves behind the right flank of the Bothmer Corps was deemed necessary for this.\n",

Only on the morning of June 11 did the right wing of the 1st Infantry Division penetrate the rubble heap that Zurawno had become. Simultaneously, the other parts of the Bothmer Corps crossed the road leading from there to Noweislio and advanced north under constant skirmishes with weaker enemy detachments. While the 1st Infantry Division swung into a strong bridgehead drawn in a semicircle around Mynsifta by evening, the Guard worked its way to the heavily barricaded railway line running east from Jydaczow and approached the fortress-like village of Rogozno; the half of the 48th Reserve Division followed as corps reserve. The 1st Cavalry Division, which had spent the night at Noweislio, crossed the Stryj at Potokrowce and surprised the enemy in the morning, who returned to Cuculowce by evening over the right wing of the Szurmay Group.\n",

Observations from the aerial reconnaissance conducted after the fall of Przemysl gave the overall impression on the evening of June 3 that the enemy was withdrawing his defeated troops in the direction of Lemberg, while simultaneously bringing in new strong forces by rail and on foot marches approximately to the line Mosciska—Krakowiec—Lubaczow.</body>\n",

      "<body>the line Mosciska—Krakowiec—Lubaczow led up. Here, behind the front still held by the enemy at the time, a second fortified position was recognized. Another strong barrier position was formed by the Beresnica (Grodel Position) and as a continuation to the north, the ridge over Niemirow to Narol Miasto, protecting Lemberg. Behind this spatially deeply structured defense zone, the railway Chodorow—Lemberg—Rawa Ruska formed a favorable cross-connection, while six railway lines branched off from it as feeder lines to these new battle fronts. The railway situation was heavily contested on the side of the allies. Only the railway over Sariow, where transports to Przemysl would be possible in the coming days, and over Rzeszow, which would be completed from June 3 to Jaroslau, led into the area of the three attacking armies of Generaloberst von Mackensen. On this latter railway, the transport of reinforcements for the 11th Army and the supply of army needs had to be carried out. The condition of the roads and paths, which were deeply rutted due to heavy use and covered with tough mud due to frequent thunderstorms, added to the difficulties. It was therefore necessary to first establish a solid base for the new offensive of the allied armies. Only then, and after carrying out troop movements from the Austro-Hungarian 3rd to the 4th Army, could operations begin. The following days were thus used for assembling the newly joining forces behind the front of the 11th Army and organizing the three armies into their future battle fronts.\n",
      "In addition, it was necessary to align the still unfinished combat operations east of Przemysl with the new operational idea. For this, the previous left wing of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army was to advance to Mosciska, with the Beskiden Corps advancing to Hobbynia on the left, and the Austro-Hungarian XVII Corps advancing to Czerniawa. The departure of this last corps to the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army was to take place only after its section had been taken over by the Beskiden Corps. The XXXXI Reserve Corps had to swing in up to the Wisznia in line Czerniawa—Starzawa. During the necessary movements for this, the Beskiden Corps already encountered a strongly fortified enemy position on June 4, which then ran from the Sieczna bend over the heights on this side of the Wisznia to Starzawa. The tenacious defensive battle of the Russians showed that it could not merely be about rearguard actions. On June 5, the Austro-Hungarian XVII Corps and the XXXXI Reserve Corps joined forces in front of this front. In doing so, progress was made in the battle for Starzawa. There, the emphasis was on the attack to roll up the enemy position from the north.</body>\n",

Czerniawa was reached in the follow-up. This also advanced the left wing of the Austro-Hungarian XVII Corps, which climbed the Buczki Heights southwest of Czerniawa. However, the right wing of the corps stalled before Josefowka. Multiple strong counterattacks by the Russians failed. On June 7, the replacement of the XVII Corps by the Beskiden Corps and the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division was ordered. The initial intention to maintain the pressure from the north through the XXXXI Reserve Corps was abandoned by Generaloberst von Mackensen, as he now assessed the combat strength of the opposing Russians as low. The 11th Bavarian Infantry Division, supported only by the artillery of the XXXXI Reserve Corps, was to attack in the direction of Hodynne-Czerniawa. The main thrust was directed against Josefowka. However, it did not break through on June 8. The Beskiden Corps also achieved only some local successes. On June 9, repeated bloody assaults against Josefowka failed to bring down this stronghold, which also supported the adjacent fronts on both sides. Therefore, Generaloberst von Mackensen decided to halt the attack at the line reached so far and to resume it only with the start of the general offensive. The 11th Bavarian Infantry Division was relieved by the Beskiden Corps and withdrew from the battlefront as an army reserve. The Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army also had to cease its partial attacks, as it had to withdraw forces from its front to protect its right flank against the Russian advance over the Dniester. Thus, it was not possible to achieve the desired starting position for the major offensive near Mosciska in the area east of Przemysl.\n",
      "In the northern flank of the 11th Army, not everything went according to the wishes of the 11th Army High Command. The enemy advances against the northern front of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army continued. A strong Russian attack was expected. The situation remained tense here until the arrival of the two reinforcement corps (X and XVII) sent by the 3rd Army. This posed a threat to the Rzeszów-Jaroslaw railway and thus to the entire deployment. Therefore, from the reinforcements rolling towards the 11th Army, the first to arrive, the 22nd Infantry Division, was positioned as support behind the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army on June 4.</body>\n",

In front of the 11th and 4th Army, parts of the enemy had been withdrawn southeast against the South Army, and further withdrawals from the front line to the east were observed. The enemy was apparently organizing for defense in depth. On June 10, Generaloberst von Mackensen issued the attack order for the 13th.\n",
      "Reconnaissance and preparations on the entire front of the 11th Army had already begun on June 6. A partial advance of the 56th and 119th Infantry Divisions, consolidated under the command of General von Behr, was to precede the general offensive on June 12, advancing over the lower Lubaczowka towards Sieniawa to facilitate the crossing of the San by the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. The main assault group of the 11th Army, the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, the Guard, and XXII Reserve Corps¹), had the task of breaking through in a northeasterly direction. The X Army Corps was initially to join the attack only with its right wing, covering the left army flank until the Behr Corps could also advance eastward. On the right army wing, the XXXXI Reserve Corps was to overcome the broad Wisznia section, thereby facilitating the advance of both the VI Corps and the left wing of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army. The 11th Bavarian Infantry Division, the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division, and the 88th Reserve Infantry Brigade of the XXII Reserve Corps were designated as army reserves. The Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division was to follow at the disposal of the Mackensen High Command behind the right wing of the 4th Army.\n",

      "The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army of General Infantry Archduke Josef Ferdinand was to immediately follow the advance of the left wing of the 11th Army on Sieniawa on June 12, crossing the San between Sieniawa and Ulanow with as strong forces as possible in the direction of Rawa Ruska–Narol Miasto, and take over the cover of the left flank at the Tanew section. For the opening of the offensive over the San, the German 22nd Infantry Division had already been subordinated to the army on June 9, to be deployed on the right wing with the Austro-Hungarian XVII Corps. The corps command ordered the division for June 12 to make a frontal attack over the San on the route Lubaczowka-Mouth–Lezachow. The division commander, Lieutenant General Dieffenbach, however, requested permission to also attack the strong support points identified in the Lubaczowka–San corner from the south, whereupon his division was assigned the area up to east of Manasterz. The division was then to be relieved by the XVII Corps on the night of June 14 and follow the left wing of the 11th Army. Furthermore, Colonel General von Mackensen pointed out to the 4th Army the necessity of a simultaneous frontal attack against the San front. In further advances to the east, he anticipated an offensive thrust by the enemy against the left flank of the 11th Army. \"Against this possibility, it is necessary to cover the advance of the 11th Army,\" Colonel von Seeckt stated in a letter to the High Command of the 4th Army, \"for if it has to divert its own forces early, its striking power to the east will weaken.\" The 4th Army was therefore to initially allocate as few forces as possible for the offensive task at the Tanew section, Archduke Josef Ferdinand intended to accompany the advance of the 11th Army to Sieniawa through the XVII and IX Corps and from there to Cieszanow through the XVII Corps. Two more divisions were to follow in the second line.\n",

The left wing of the 56th Infantry Division swung forward in the early morning attack over the Lubaczowka and withstood enemy counterattacks south of the Kotowka Forest during the morning hours. Thus covered on the flank, the simultaneously deep-advancing 119th Infantry Division of Major General von Behr pushed its attack northward over several positions. Relief attacks by the Russians from the woods to the east and west were repelled. The 22nd Infantry Division encountered significant resistance in its advance north of Manasterz, which was only broken around noon by a frontal attack and encirclement from the east. The division then drove the enemy back to the heights southeast of Sieniawa. By 5 p.m., Sieniawa was also occupied. These successes made it possible for the previously unsuccessful crossing of the allied troops over the San to succeed. At Sieniawa, they joined the German battlefront. The 22nd Infantry Division had to forgo the immediate execution of the attack against the Czlawa Heights because its artillery deployed on the western bank of the San could not be in place in time. The bridge built by the allies at Lezachow was only completed in the evening. Against the deep right flank of the 119th Infantry Division at the Kotowka Forest, heavy Russian counterattacks were launched in the evening, which could be countered by timely shifting of forces from the left to the right wing. However, the division was so heavily engaged in the night combat that its immediate relief by the Austro-Hungarian 11th Infantry Division, which had arrived behind the front, was not possible.\n",
      "In the early morning of June 13, the 11th Army launched a frontal breakthrough. The Guard Corps, positioned in the center of the main assault group, achieved a great success. The 2nd Guard Infantry Division under Lieutenant General von Winkler managed to wrest Tucholka from the enemy by 9 a.m. Advancing, the division captured Kobylnica Ruska by 2 p.m. and seized the heights adjoining to the north.

Even so, the deep breakthrough already had a favorable effect on the course of the battle at the connection fronts.\n",
      "The Austro-Hungarian VI Corps had broken into the enemy's position at Jagrebla and Jalazie. However, only the 12th Infantry Division managed to push further and thereby initiate an encirclement from the north. It was not until around 3 in the afternoon that the resistance also collapsed in front of the 39th Infantry Division. Both divisions then worked their way through to the eastern edge of the large forest zone, where they now encountered new enemy positions at 6 in the evening. The XXXXI Reserve Corps, after initial successes on both sides of the Wisznia near Oltrow and further north, entered into heavy, fluctuating combat. It was only when the 81st Reserve Division broke through Malnow at 9 in the evening that relief came for the heavily engaged 82nd Reserve Division in the Wisznia depression. The evening storming of the Aufowa height north of Malnow created a connection to the allies to the north. To the right, contact with the possession corps of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army on the Wisznia was maintained. Its attack overcame the enemy stronghold of Jozefowka. Further advances on both sides of the stream depression to the east were, however, prevented by Russian counterattacks. Even an encirclement initiated from the north only brought the heights on this side of the place into the possession of the attacker.\n",
      "On the northern wing of the main assault group, the advance of the XXII Reserve Corps under the leadership of General of Cavalry von Falkenhayn encountered particular difficulties, as the enemy positions skillfully flanked each other. The main target of the attack for the 43rd Reserve and 107th Infantry Division was the village of Mielkis Nowy, which had been expanded on several fronts. It was only when the rapid success of the 82nd Reserve Division and the advance of the 107th Infantry Division eliminated the mutual flanking effect of the enemy against the attack on Mielkis Nowy that the village was stormed around noon. As the combat area expanded upon entering the large forests, the 44th Reserve Division was inserted into the center. The right wing of the corps advancing in the mountain forest near Pamfka Niwa was halted by darkness.

In the afternoon, the 20th Infantry Division pushed across this river to the stream section on both sides of Olszówka. This created space for the deployment of the 19th Infantry Division, which was brought up in the second line. In a difficult maneuver to the flank, it overcame the wide Lubaczowka lowlands and continued its attack into the night. At 3 a.m., Wulka Zapałowska fell.\n",
      "At the front of the Behr Corps, the battle north of the Lubaczowka concluded only in the early morning of June 13. The enemy retreated. The relief of the 119th Infantry Division by the allies was completed by 11 a.m. The division attempted to swing south through the Rotowka Forest for a flanking effect but encountered the enemy in the forest. Thus, it was only possible to advance the inner wings of the 56th and 119th Infantry Divisions east of the forest.\n",
      "Against Sieniawa, the Russians launched several attacks during the night of June 12 to 13, which were apparently only meant to cover their withdrawal to the east and north.

The tip of the breakthrough wedge of the Guard had advanced far to the east, close to the intermediate position determined by reconnaissance: Krakowiec – Wielkie Oczy – Lutowice – Lubaczow.

      "Also from the right wing of the 11th Army, the XXXX1st Reserve and Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, the enemy only positioned themselves on June 14 in the positions on both sides of the Kradowice-Gees. In fierce preliminary skirmishes, the XXXX1st Reserve Corps advanced to the heights on this side of the Szklo. The intention of the Hungarian 39th Infantry Division to relieve the corps of General von Francois south of the lake failed, as they themselves encountered the enemy. The Austro-Hungarian 12th Infantry Division also faced a difficult frontal attack north of the lake. The crossing over the Szklo lowland was opened to them by their left wing advancing with the Guard Corps. They then reached up to the eastern edge of the large lake and at night up to Swidnica.\n",
      "The Guard Corps unexpectedly encountered particularly strong resistance at Wielkie Oczy. It was not until 4 in the afternoon that the divisions could begin their assault. The 1st Guard Infantry Division under Colonel Eitel Friedrich Prince of Prussia overcame the Berzenitz and extended this success northward. Then the left wing of the division also pushed through Wielkie Oczy. The planned encirclement of the 2nd Guard Infantry Division from the north failed due to the strength of the Bucznik massif. Only after relief by the 1st Guard Infantry Division could their right wing penetrate Wielkie Oczy at 7 in the evening after a hard fight and then connect with the right neighbor. Thus also encircled from the south, the Bucznik fell. Meanwhile, the left wing did not advance significantly further, especially since the situation in the forest zone further north was unclear. Here, the two southern divisions of the XXII Reserve Corps had followed the enemy retreating to the Ladowa Nima height. After a difficult advance, the 43rd Reserve Division of Major General von Runckel took possession of the position there at 7° in the evening.

When the right wing of the 20th Infantry Division broke through at the Lubaczowka and flanked to the left, the enemy abandoned his position at noon. The attempts of the 19th Infantry Division to extend their nightly success at Wulka Zapalowka to the east and north were met with strong Russian resistance, and progress was only made around noon. In the afternoon, the entire front of the X Army Corps advanced slowly after the heavy fighting. By evening, the connection to the XXII Reserve Corps at the Lubaczowka and the northern forest edge south of Lipina was reached.\n",

Its left wing advanced northwest to support the right wing of the 119th Infantry Division. This reached the southern edge of the Kotowka Forest by evening, gaining possession of Ropa. However, the left wing of the division, like the adjacent battlefront of the allies, advanced only with difficulty in heavy forest fighting. Therefore, the command of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army considered it necessary to relieve by advancing north of the Kotowka Forest towards the Czarne Heights. For this, they requested and received the German 22nd Infantry Division. This moved east of the Slawa Heights into the battle line to attack the following day. Downstream, only little ground was gained.\n",
      "By noon, Generaloberst von Mackensen, under the impression of the Russian retreat in front of the 2nd Army's front and based on reports of marches from the Krakowice—Lubaczow line to the east and northeast, had given the order to pursue up to the Grodek position. However, the further course of the day showed that the enemy had only retreated to a strong position ten kilometers back in front of the 2nd Army and intended to hold out in front of the 11th Army as well. According to prisoner reports, they had positioned 19 divisions. Also, south and north of Szklo and on both sides of the Lubaczowka, a breakthrough into the position had been achieved so far.\n",
      "The attack of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, which began on June 15, brought only some local successes west of Borowno on the northern flank, with the Beskiden Corps fighting in conjunction with the XXXI Reserve Corps.

At 6 p.m., Colonel von Seeckt issued the following directive to the corps chiefs of staff: “The pursuit operation is progressing well across the entire front of the three armies. The situation has changed in our favor since yesterday, as the enemy has thrown parts of his main forces against us again, thereby offering us the opportunity to defeat him in open field. We will therefore encounter less resistance in the main position he has prepared and may be able to penetrate it with him. In this sense, the pursuit in the combat zones must be relentlessly continued.” To further consolidate the forces of the 11th Army for the breakthrough attack on Magierow, its boundary with the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army was shifted to the left towards the forest ridge of Rubyn, which simultaneously enabled this army to encircle the Grodek position north around Lake Janow.\n",

The right wing and the center of the 11th Army also continued the pursuit relentlessly. Driving enemy rearguards before them, the four southern corps reached the line Sądlo—Niemirow and northward despite great marching difficulties.

The 20th Infantry Division was set to attack from the south, the 19th Infantry Division from the west. Positions were stormed and taken shortly after noon. On the heights south of the Solotwa, the enemy set up new resistance. The attack was transferred to the 19th Infantry Division, but due to the advanced time of day, it could not be carried out. The 20th Infantry Division marched eastwards towards Sieniawa. The Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division was moved forward to close the gap between the XXII Reserve Corps and the X Army Corps. In front of the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division, the enemy still held positions north of Oleszyce at the forest edge behind it. The division prepared for a comprehensive attack on both sides. Its left wing crossed the stream section at Zabiala around noon. In the late afternoon, the 56th Infantry Division appeared on the battlefield northwest of Zabiala after a difficult march on deep sandy forest paths. Meanwhile, the Bajon had already taken the enemy positions north of Oleszyce. Both divisions were now to jointly attack the Kubaszyna Forest the next day on the orders of General von Stein. This necessitated a left swing of the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division. During the night, it took possession of Dachnow. Through this bold action, the enemy in the Kubaszyna Forest was surrounded on three sides. Thus, even though the left wing of the 11th Army had not fallen significantly behind compared to the center and the right wing, there was a well-founded prospect that after overcoming the Russian resistance, it would soon join the advance to the east in a staggered formation on the left.\n",

Prisoners generally reported severe ammunition shortages among the Russians and emphasized the tremendous moral effect of the German artillery. The infantry replacements were said to have noticeably deteriorated due to short and inadequate training, especially since the training depots lacked rifles. Colonel General von Mackensen pointed out to his subordinate command authorities that \"defeated troops\" had occupied the new positions. The corps would have to decide independently whether rapid seizure or methodical attack was appropriate. \"That a quick decision is advantageous and necessary will be clear to every position.\" As before, the operational center of gravity remained in the middle of the 11th Army.

Of the three divisions that preceded this, two — the 56th and the 22nd Infantry Divisions — cooperated with the left neighboring army throughout the operation, while the third, the 119th Infantry Division, eventually pushed through but did not reach the target area for deployment. Also, a division of the army reserve, the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division, had to be used alongside the X Army Corps to protect the left flank. This significant loss of striking power did not have adverse consequences for the continuation of the operation, as after the vigorous breakthrough of the army center at Magierow, the offensive was no longer continued eastward but gradually shifted northward. In this process, the forces staggered backward for flank protection could quickly be deployed in the new front.\n",
      "Reviewing the overall operation from Gorlice to Lemberg, the Allies' offensive in seven weeks advanced more than 300 kilometers through numerous, temporarily expanded enemy positions with the involvement of local inhabitants, constantly engaging in heavy fighting, culminating in four massive breakthrough battles. The combat losses of the 11th Army amounted to about 87,000 men, including 12,000 dead. What the troops and supply formations accomplished during this time in relentless advance, mostly in scorching heat on mud-covered roads, deep sand, or the worst mountain paths, and the hardships endured in the enemy-evacuated, barely accommodating land, can be placed alongside their combat activity and leadership. In terms of health, particularly dangerous areas with extremely poor water conditions had to be traversed. From the San onward, cholera and typhus appeared, and the Galician dysentery spread. Nevertheless, due to prudent and thorough sanitary measures and the selfless dedication of the medical personnel, the health condition of the armies was such that the course of military operations remained secure.\n",
      "The bloody and especially the other losses of the Russians were much heavier. More than a quarter of a million prisoners of war, 224 guns, and over 600 machine guns were left in the hands of the 11th Army alone.\n",

      "The successful course of Generaloberst von Mackensen's offensive on Lemberg had meanwhile also made itself felt in the course of events on the Dniester Front. Initially, however, the Southern Army faced a new serious crisis when its left wing was hit again by a counterattack of strong Russian forces on June 14. Northwest of Bortniki, Russian guards broke over the Dniester and pushed the 1st Infantry Division of Bothmer's Corps back to the road leading from Zurawno to Szydlaczow; by deploying the corps reserve and with the help of the right wing of the 3rd Guard Infantry Division, it was possible to retake part of the lost ground by evening. West of Stryj, however, the right wing of the Szurmay Group had to be bent back halfway to Tejszarow after further resistance. West of the Lemberg railway, Bildez was lost. The Kornhaber Group on the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army was also temporarily forced to abandon its positions. While the enemy limited itself the following day to holding the ground gained against Bothmer's Corps, it continued its attack on the Szurmay Group with undiminished force and pushed it back in fierce fighting to the line Tejszarow–Letnia. Stryj was once again seriously threatened. General von Linsingen found it necessary to bring in other forces to support his left wing. On the afternoon of the 15th, two battalions of Bothmer's Corps were sent to assist the Szurmay Group. Furthermore, General von Gerok received orders to relieve the Hungarian 38th Infantry Division the following night with the half 19th Infantry Division held back as army reserve in Wosnilo and to set it in motion towards Rudki.\n",
      "The two Hungarian battalions could be used for a counterattack at Wolica, where the enemy had attacked again on the morning of June 16 and gained ground. In every further advance of the Russians on both sides of the Lemberg railway in the direction so threatening to the Southern Army towards Stryj, General von Linsingen set two more battalions of Bothmer's Corps and three batteries of the 38th Infantry Division in motion towards Wolica and placed these forces under the command of Major General Gentner. The positions that had been given up could be reoccupied in the evening.</body>\n",

      "The enemy, under the influence of Generaloberst von Mackensen's offensive, refrained from continuing his attacks south of the Dniester. Calm prevailed along the entire front of the Southern Army. On June 17, the 38th Infantry Division, under General Count von Bothmer, repelled the 40th in their positions on the west bank of the Stryj. Field Marshal Lieutenant von Kornhaber moved the bulk of the 51st Infantry Division across to the right bank of the Dniester and launched an attack at dawn on the 18th as part of the offensive task assigned to the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army. The left wing of the Southern Army — the Szurmay Group and the 38th Infantry Division — joined in. The enemy retreated to the Dniester under weak resistance and completely abandoned the southern bank the following day. Only the bridgeheads of Zydaczow and Woloczyn remained strongly held. Against the latter, the 38th Infantry Division advanced, gaining ground only slowly. The Szurmay Group followed on both sides of the Lemberg railway to the Dniester and positioned the 40th Infantry Division to the right of the 7th, replacing General Gentner's troops, who withdrew to the Bothmer Corps. On June 20, the 51st Infantry Division completed the river crossing at Kolodruby and reconnected with the right wing of their army, advancing against the Szczerzec sector. Upon receiving this news, General von Linsingen ordered the Szurmay Group in the afternoon to join their left neighbor's advance over the Dniester, to seize Zydaczow and Woloczyn for the Bothmer Corps and then also cross the river. He intended, as he had already communicated in the army command order on June 17, to force the crossing over the Dniester again on both sides of Zurawno between Buczaczowce and Holeszow, as more favorable conditions seemed to present themselves there than further upstream. In the following days, the necessary regrouping of the army was carried out. The Szurmay Group left the Southern Army on the evening of June 20 and joined the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army. Opposite the Marschall Group, the enemy continued to hold their strong bridgehead positions around Halicz-Jezupol.</body>\n",

      "The Austro-Hungarian 7th Army also had to endure hard and varied battles during these days to hold the Dniester line. On June 15, its left wing managed to wrest the bridgehead of Nizniow from the enemy. However, on the same day, General von Pflanzer-Baltin was forced to withdraw the Korda Corps, advancing eastward between the Pruth and Dniester, to the Bojan—Horoszowa line, as an intercepted Russian order indicated an enemy advance over the Dniester below Zaleszczyki was to be expected. The river security in the gap between the Korda Corps and the Kaiser Group was assigned to half of the 8th and 10th Cavalry Divisions, with an army reserve formed at Zastawno from a brigade each of the 8th and 5th Cavalry Divisions and parts of the Krautwald Corps. However, the enemy's attack did not come from the north as expected, but against the front of the Korda Corps, which had roughly established its new positions by the night of the 16th. In the following days, it had to fend off repeated mass assaults by the Russian XXXII Corps and 3rd Cavalry Corps, which was only successful with the deployment of the army reserve. The four cavalry divisions now united north of the Korda Corps (Hungarian 5th, Austro-Hungarian 6th, 8th, and 10th) were grouped under Field Marshal Lieutenant von Benigni and reinforced by forces hastily brought in from the left army wing, as new reports indicated Russian attacks from the northern Dniester bank were also to be expected. On the night of the 20th, the enemy occupied the Dniester loop west of Uscie Biskupie and the next day launched a concentric attack from here and from the large forest area east of Rarwienczy. The defender had to retreat to the heights west of Dnutf; here, on June 22, he repelled all enemy assaults.\n",
      "On the left army wing, after the capture of the bridgehead of Nizniow, only weaker parts of the Schönburg Group remained along the Dniester stretch from Ostra to Maryampol. General von Pflanzer-Baltin had deployed the main forces of his western wing over the Dniester against the line Potok Zlothy—Ropotice to force the enemy to abandon his positions south of the river at Czernelica by threatening his rear. General von Rybemont was tasked with the unified command of the operation. Already on the night of June 16, the Czbula Group had moved into the river loop south of Kolomea to Turb. During the day, parts of the Schönburg Group and the Rybemont Corps also crossed at and south of Ostra.\n",

      "The attackers pushed the stubbornly resisting enemy back to Kosmierzyn and Koropiec by the evening of June 18. The next day, the offensive was to be continued with full force, with parts turning east and west to force the enemy to evacuate the Czernelecia bend and the northern bank of Nizniow. Due to heavy counterattacks by the Russians, which began on June 19, General von Rhemen was forced into defense and had to abandon Kosmierzyn again. As further reinforcement of the Benigni group had become urgent, General von Pflanzer ordered on the 20th the cessation of the offensive over the Dniester and moved the dispensable forces here to the right wing of the army.\n",
      "The offensive of the German Southern Army, which began on May 12, soon suffered from being assigned a dual task pointing in two different directions. It was to reach the upper Dniester in conjunction with the neighboring Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army on the left and thus the western Galician front of the Allies, advancing northward, and to exert operational pressure eastward to halt the Russian 9th Army's offensive directed against its right neighboring army in the area between the Dniester and Pruth.\n",
      "This dual task, although the Southern Army initially had a significant superiority in units (9½ infantry divisions) over the opposing Russian 11th Army (6¾ infantry divisions), made it difficult to establish a focal point. After relatively easily achieved, spatially significant initial successes, explained by the voluntary retreat of the enemy, the progress of the advancing army in a broad front was minimal from the moment it encountered stubborn resistance. Only when General von Linsingen concentrated the forces of his left wing at the end of May, consciously accepting the risk of a setback on the right, did the push on Stryj pave the way for a decisive turn in the situation. However, since this success was not expanded northward with all available force to expel the enemy from the southern Dniester bank, and the focus was instead placed on the instructions of the army command for cooperation with the right neighboring army over Stryj-Lesie in an eastern, almost southeastern direction, a serious danger arose for the insufficiently secured left wing of the army. This manifested itself after a few days when the Russians received reinforcements, resulting in the heavy and costly setback north of Stryj and at Zurawno.\n",

That the Russians finally abandoned the southern bank of the Dniester happened under the impression of the failures of their neighboring front in the area west of Lemberg. A decisive impact on the course of the offensive of Generaloberst von Mackensen, as General von Linsingen had considered on June 8, albeit only temporarily, was denied to the two armies of the allied right wing until the fall of Lemberg.

      "General von Falkenhayn had, shortly after issuing the decisive orders of June 4 for the continuation of the offensive in Galicia¹), made a short visit to the German Western Front²). The impressions received there seemed to have reinforced his view that the extensive denuding of the Western Front of army reserves, which had occurred since mid-April, could only be sustained for a limited time. A withdrawal of forces from the eastern theater of war might therefore become necessary sooner than previously assumed. Shortly after his return to Ples, he reminded General von Conrad in a letter dated June 12 of \"the immediate execution of reinforcement work on the Dniester-Wisznia and San lines with all conceivable means.\" The reason for this, he stated, was the fear \"that the development might not be far enough advanced if we were forced by the situation to withdraw significant forces from Galicia. Such a situation could arise unexpectedly, although he currently had no indications for it.\" General von Conrad initially stated in his response that all orders for the strongest establishment of the San line, insofar as it was already in their possession, and the lower Wisznia line had been made, while the connection to the upper Dniester and the Dniester line itself would still have to be fought for.</body>\n",

However, he hoped that the now jointly planned thrust by the Allies in Galicia would be continued with full force until the decisive defeat of the Russian army.\"\n",
      "General von Falkenhayn agreed, as his response on June 13 proved, that the common goal must remain \"for the time being the decisive defeat\" of the enemy. However, he also pointed out that \"the operations in Galicia had been severely hampered by various incidents,\" and expressed doubt \"whether it would be possible to continue them until the decisive defeat of the enemy.\" \"The enemy will try to evade the thrust, and we cannot pursue him indefinitely.\" During the course of June 13, however, his view approached that of General von Conrad. From the reports of the high commands of the 11th and the Southern Army about the stubborn battles of the day, he gained the impression that the Russians were determined to resist with all their might. This also increased his hope for the success of a decisive blow. On the evening of June 13, he proposed in a letter to General von Conrad to transport the German divisions still in Syrmia, whose continued presence on the Serbian border no longer seemed necessary to him, to the Galician theater of war and to assign them to the Southern Army \"so that it would receive the necessary forces to facilitate the advance of Mackensen's army eastward over the Dniester.\"\n",
      "General von Conrad was pleased to find agreement with his own view \"that the main decision against the Russian army in Galicia should be sought with all force.\" Assuming \"that the enemy would accept this decisive battle at the latest along the general line Bereszyca—Nagyow—Karol,\" he also considered the movement of strong forces from the south over the Dniester particularly important for success. However, he declared that leaving at least one German division in Syrmia to prevent a Serbian incursion was indispensable and was ready for the immediate transport of the general command of the X Reserve Corps and the 101st and 105th Infantry Divisions.</body>\n",

On June 16, he felt compelled to inform the Commander-in-Chief East that he should not count on two divisions just released into his command area through the deployment of Landsturm formations for his purposes2). The letter stated: \"The pressure on the Western Front is now so strong and the necessity to effectively support the left flank of the 11th Army during its decisive advance to the east can become so compelling that the deployment of the divisions at one point or another may become unavoidable.\"\n",

On June 18, he suggested to General von Falkenhayn, after the fall of Lemberg, to advance \"between the Bug and Vistula towards Warsaw against the strong Russian forces located there, to end the war with Russia or at least to completely break its resistance3).\" He believed that solving this task would not require all the German forces currently deployed in Galicia, and proposed to withdraw two army corps to the western theater of war after the completion of the current operation, to make necessary replacements with them at the 6th Army. General von Falkenhayn himself hoped to go significantly further in reducing the German eastern forces. \"His Excellency agrees,\" it is stated in a private diary of Colonel Tappen, \"but wants to bring three more corps to Gaede to clear Alsace. Whether these three goals can be achieved simultaneously still needs to be examined.\" If the agreement noted here by General von Falkenhayn referred not only to the withdrawal of forces to the west but also to the continuation of operations in the east according to Colonel Tappen's proposal, it is hardly to be assumed that the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army was considering a decisive offensive between the Bug and Vistula against the main mass of the Russian army.</body>\n",

On the train journey from Jaroslaw to Radyminu, on the morning of June 19, Generaloberst von Mackensen reported on the favorable progress of the offensive. Whether the idea of initiating a new operation in the area between the Bug and Vistula was discussed, and what position General von Falkenhayn actually took, could no longer be determined. In any case, the 11th Army Command itself, in view of the favorable course of the battles northwest of Lemberg, was eager to adapt the movements of the armies under its command during the ongoing operation as much as possible to the new operational idea that was emerging. When it became clear after the major breakthrough success at Magierow on the evening of June 19 that the majority of the enemy opposite the 11th Army had withdrawn northward, Generaloberst von Mackensen decided not to continue his army's advance eastward beyond the Lemberg—Rawa Ruska road, but to gradually direct the pursuit northward while consolidating forces.\n",

During this, he took the position that, regardless of the battle situation before Lemberg, whose capture was the task of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, the 11th and 4th Armies should advance north between the Bug and Vistula. General von Falkenhayn argued against this, stating that a separation of the tasks of the armies under Generaloberst von Mackensen seemed premature. He proposed that the decision on the continuation of operations on a large scale should only be made after the expected fall of Lemberg. Consequently, the following directive was initially agreed upon for all armies:\n",
      "\"The operations currently progressing so successfully are to be carried out by Generaloberst von Mackensen with the 4th, 11th, and 2nd Armies until the capture of Lemberg. At the same time, the dissolution of the enemy retreating northward through attack, wherever he positions himself, is to be completed. The Szurmay Group is now subordinated to the 2nd Army command\"). The Southern Army is to cross the Dniester and advance towards the area east of Lemberg. The 7th Army advances over the Dniester and secures the right flank of the army and the unconditional possession of Czernowitz.\"\n",
      "The directive was issued on the evening of June 20. It was nothing more than a repetition of the tasks already assigned to the individual armies, with which they were still occupied at the time. The motives of General von Falkenhayn for this formulation of the directive are evident from a simultaneously dispatched telegram intended only for Generaloberst von Mackensen and his chief of staff: \"The directive has received its formulation because, on the one hand, to achieve the goal while retaining all forces under your command, full freedom of action should initially be maintained, while on the other hand, the Supreme Army Command must reserve the right, considering the overall situation, to issue new directives as soon as it deems necessary, if necessary, with a reduction of the forces there. After carrying out the operations according to the above directive, it will certainly not be missed to draw German divisions from the 11th Army for use in the West. If special circumstances do not require any other measures, then the intention is: the 2nd Army will leave Army Group Mackensen to clean Galicia of the enemy with parts of the current Southern Army and 7th Army and to cover the right flank of the 11th Army.</body>\n",

      "Following this, General von Falkenhayn was ready to join General von Conrad's proposal for the continuation of operations after the fall of Lemberg, which aimed to detach the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army from the command area of Colonel General von Mackensen and involve it in the downstream advances. If his intention to reduce the 11th Army by four divisions is maintained, the difference from the operations proposal made by Colonel von Seeckt on June 15 becomes clear. It seems that General von Falkenhayn, in the planned advance of the 11th and 4th Armies between the Bug and Vistula, did not envision the initiation of a new operation with far-reaching goals, but only a spatially limited pursuit, as also expressed in the directive itself with the words, \"to complete the dissolution of the enemy retreating northward by attacking wherever he positions himself.\" Consequently, the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army had no reservations about returning the limited right of disposition over the two divisions to be detached from the front in his command area to the Commander-in-Chief East upon his request received on June 20. He therefore believed he did not need them on the battlefield between the Bug and Vistula.\n",
      "On June 22, before the news of the fall of Lemberg had reached him, General von Conrad, in line with his previous view, addressed General von Falkenhayn with the following operational proposal:\n",
      "\"2nd Army might take Lemberg today. Of the agreed tasks, one is then fulfilled, the other, pursuit by 4th Army and 11th Army northward, still to be fulfilled. My proposal: Colonel General von Mackensen carries out this task with 4th and 11th Army. The latter is assigned occupation troops to cover the Dniester line towards Kaminowka Strumilowa. 2nd Army leaves the association of Army Group Mackensen and pursues the enemy towards Busk (inclusive)–Friedjow (inclusive). South Army advances, as already reported as a replacement, with a strong right wing down the Dniester towards Surawno, to close off Halicz from the north and advance over the lower Gnila Lipa up to and including Rohatyn.</body>\n",

      "General von Falkenhayn agreed with this proposal. However, he did not prescribe an end goal for the Southern Army. The further it advances, the better it is. He also considered the attachment of the Beskiden Corps to the direction of Kaminoka Strumilowa unnecessary, as it might not be essential. For the continuation of operations, he requested the most rapid expansion of the railway lines Stryj—Chodorow, Przemysl—Lemberg, and Jaroslaw—Rawa Ruska.\n",
      "Despite his agreement with the operational proposal of General von Conrad, the German Chief of General Staff maintained the intention to transfer four divisions from the area of the 11th Army to the western theater of war. Corresponding orders were issued on June 22. The 8th Bavarian Reserve Division was to begin its transport from the area of Jaroslaw on June 26, with the 56th Infantry Division and the XXXXI Reserve Corps to follow around June 28. The measure was justified by the fact that \"given the current situation, in conjunction with the losses inflicted on the Russians since the beginning of this operational phase, a reduction of German forces in the southeast is possible without impairing the tasks still to be solved and is necessary with regard to the situation on the Western Front.\" General von Falkenhayn informed General von Conrad orally of the impending transport during a meeting in Teschen on the afternoon of June 22. For several days, he even considered the intention, already expressed to Colonel Tappen on June 18, to transfer three more corps from the 11th and Southern Army to the west, \"to clear Upper Alsace of the enemy.\"</body>\n",

The instructions arriving from Teschen on the evening of the 20th assigned the army the further operational task of advancing \"towards the area east of Lemberg\" after completing the river crossing. Contrary to the wishes of General von Conrad, to cross with the left wing of the Southern Army at Wolcniow, General von Linsingen held firm at the position chosen by him at and behind Zurawno, as he hoped that the Southern Army would be able to break through the defensive position established by the Russians behind the Gnila Lipa and roll it up from the south, as well as threaten Halicz from the north and the enemy in front of the 7th Army on its right flank. However, the forcing of the Dniester crossing was to take place only on the night of June 22 to 23, as only slightly more than half of the reinforcements had been unloaded in Stryj so far. General von Conrad agreed to this and also approved the further operational intention to advance over the lower Gnila Lipa. His new instructions arriving on June 22 were in this sense. The German Chief of Staff particularly emphasized that it was important to \"advance the thrust of the Southern Army with the greatest possible acceleration on the northern Dniester bank, even if only at one point, to damage the enemy retreating from south of Lemberg.\"</body>\n",

      "<body>Even during the night of June 24, the corps of Gerok, Kosch, and Bothmer were unable to bring stronger forces to the northern bank, as the enemy sought to prevent the construction of bridges and footbridges through continuous artillery fire. At daybreak, massive Russian counterattacks began, which the few crossed battalions of the allies could only fend off with great difficulty and at the cost of heavy losses. Under these circumstances, the 3rd Guard Infantry Division refrained from further crossing attempts at Holeszow, where only a few companies had been able to establish themselves on the northern bank, and crossed with the main force behind the 48th Reserve Division east of Bzaczow, to force the stubborn defenders to retreat by flanking through Bortniki. The enemy opposed the advance of the left wing of the army and the neighboring b.-u. V. Corps to the east at the lake and stream section between Bortniki and Bobrka.\n",
      "Although the fords became unusable due to the rising Dniester and the bridge sites were still under heavy enemy fire, it was finally possible the following night to bring the bulk of the infantry of the Kosch Corps and the 1st Infantry Division to the opposite bank. During the course of June 25, the enemy was driven from the heights west of Butaczow and northeast of Zurawno. Holeszow fell into the hands of the Guard. However, their main force could not take Bortniki. Larger successes were also denied to the northern parts of the Bothmer Corps.\n",
      "The next day, the Kosch Corps had pushed the enemy behind the Swirz section. The three German divisions of General Count von Bothmer advanced fighting to the line Stryehorow—Chodorow. For further attacks against and over the Gnila Lipa, General von Linsingen made the 48th Reserve Division, which had become dispensable on the northern flank, available again to the Gerok Corps, whose crossed parts were still heavily pressed by the enemy.\n",
      "On the night of the 27th, the Russians evacuated the bridgehead of Jezupol—Halicz; during the day, they also retreated behind the Swirz section in front of the Bothmer Corps and the right wing of the 2nd Army, which was reached everywhere by the allies and crossed by the Kosch Corps north of Butaczow under heavy fighting. Opposite Halicz, according to aerial reports and other information, the Dniester bank was only weakly occupied, and the former garrison of the bridgehead had marched behind the Sota Lipa. General von Linsingen therefore ordered the Marschall Group, to which he again subordinated the Bolzano Brigade, to cross the Dniester immediately with strong forces.</body>\n",

      "Already in the morning hours of June 28, the army, following the enemy who had withdrawn during the night, reached the entire front of the Gnila Lipa. On its eastern bank, General von Linsingen encountered only weak rearguards, believing the main enemy forces to be in continuous retreat to the east. Therefore, he urged his corps to cross the river during the day and defeat the enemy before they could establish themselves in selected positions. However, these proved to be so strong and stubbornly defended that the crossing succeeded nowhere. Only in Rohatyn did parts of the 1st Infantry Division penetrate. In the Marschall group, the Dniester crossing succeeded only at Halicz, but not further downstream; the 5th Cavalry Division was stuck opposite Marampol.\n",
      "The army command intended to focus the attack henceforth on the right wing, which was to be reinforced by the Austro-Hungarian 1st Cavalry Division and the Kosch Corps. The former was to reach the area of Butaczowce by the evening of the 29th, the latter on the road via Bursztyn Halicz. However, since the strong enemy resistance was not yet broken on this day and the eastern bank of the Gnila Lipa could only be taken in places, the planned shift of the Kosch Corps could not yet be realized. At the Gerok Corps, the newly arrived 48th Reserve Division engaged to the right of the Austro-Hungarian 19th Infantry Division. It filled the gap that had previously existed with the Bolzano Brigade. On June 30, the Kosch and Bothmer Corps were able to capture the eastern river heights in bitter fighting and hold against powerful enemy counterattacks, but a decisive success was not yet achieved on this day either.\n",
      "Thus, the Southern Army had not yet succeeded in exerting operational influence on the course of events with the neighboring armies of Generaloberst von Mackensen on the left. However, by persistently continuing its attack, it had completely paralyzed the enemy's freedom of movement and inflicted heavy losses on them. Nearly 60,000 prisoners, 24 guns, and over 100 machine guns remained in their hands in the months of May and June.

This would inevitably create an ever-widening gap between the 2nd and 11th Army during the movements. The allied army commands assumed that the separation of the enemy forces into an eastern and northern group, aimed for by the previous operation, had been successful. According to the reports available on June 23, the Russian 3rd Army was positioned with its left wing north of Rawa Ruska, facing south. The Russian 8th Army joined there, encircling Lemberg in a wide arc to the east. Although strong breakthroughs in the enemy's disrupted connections were noted, it was already apparent that the operational goal of this separation had not yet been fully achieved. The high commands of the 2nd and 11th Army were rightly concerned about their inner flanks. Their views differed on how these should be covered. The Austro-Hungarian army command decided, at the request of the 11th Army, that the coverage along the Bug down to Kaminotka Strumilowa was initially the task of the 2nd Army. From there, the 11th Army itself had to ensure the protection of its right flank through the Beskiden Corps assigned to it, after its detachment from the 2nd Army.\n",
      "In the advance area between the Bug and Vistula, an expanded defensive position between Hrubieszow and Józefow was identified through aerial reconnaissance. A position extended along the northern bank of the Rata over Narol Miasto and north of the Tanew swamp area. While the armies of Field Marshal von Mackensen took their front northward, the necessary regroupings had to be made under simultaneous consideration of the obligations imposed on the 11th Army.\n",

Rather, the Russians completely abandoned the San-Vistula angle in front of the left wing of the 4th Army on June 23. On the left bank of the Vistula, the allied troops could follow the enemy retreating beyond Sandomierz. The Austro-Hungarian 1st Army advanced there up to the Russian position in the Zawichost line (on the Vistula)—Darow, with the right wing and center of the Woyrsch Army Detachment reaching the northeastern edge of the large forest area southwest of the Baltow—Sienno—Ilza line. The rest of the front up to the Pilica remained unchanged.\n",
      "Difficulties in regrouping the forces arose on the right wing of the 11th Army northeast of Lemberg. Here, on the heights around Zoltance, the XXXXI Reserve Corps and the northern wing of the Beskiden Corps were still embroiled in heavy fighting, which significantly delayed the extraction of the last parts of the XXXXI Reserve Corps and the relief of the Beskiden Corps south of the Zoltance—Kamionka road. The Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, whose southern wing advanced to the Dawidowka on June 23, decided to expedite the relief of the Beskiden Corps by deploying the Kresja Group1) east of Lemberg and, to enable the army's extension northward, also to provide the Surmay Group2) from the right to the left army wing. However, these measures could only gradually become effective. On the other hand, the pursuit operation between the Bug and Vistula could not be halted due to the binding of the right wing of the 11th Army. Consequently, the center and left wing of the 11th Army advanced over the upper Rata to the recognized Russian position on June 25. The enemy evaded the planned attack for June 26 and retreated under disjointed rearguard actions. The 11th Army pushed through the forests south of Uhnow with its center and could also advance its left wing, effectively supported on the flank by the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, up to the heights southeast of Narol Miasto. Its right wing initially remained tied down at Zoltance. Only on June 27 could the Beskiden Corps, in conjunction with the Kresja Group now deployed on the northern wing of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, join the advance. On this day, the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army captured the ridge west of the Gnila Lipa and reached Zadoworze with its left wing and the area south of Kamionka.

Only the three army corps of the left wing of the 11th Army — the Guard Corps, XXII Reserve Corps, and X Army Corps — could carry the pursuit further northwards beyond Uhnow-Belzec. The enemy still held the important road junction Narol-Miasto for securing his retreat. His previous movements indicated two directions, an eastern one in front of the right wing of the army and a northern and northeastern one in front of the left wing. The gaps in front of the Guard Corps did not seem to be filled by Russian cavalry. The advance of the three western corps of the 11th Army on June 28 to the Huczwa lowlands west of Zerniki and beyond Tomaszow necessitated a further extension of the forces entrusted with flank protection on the right wing. Therefore, the 119th Infantry Division was inserted into the section of the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division. Both divisions were placed under the command of General v. Kneussl. Near and west of Sielec, the enemy offered stubborn resistance to secure the withdrawal of his forces retreating on Sokal and behind the Bug. On the northern wing of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army, the Kreysa group reached the Bug at Kamionka Strumilowa on this day. Otherwise, the army advanced to the Gnila Lipa and into the area west of Sliniany. Behind this section and northward behind the Bug, the enemy apparently stood in a strong position. The reconnaissance results confirmed the impression that the desired separation of the enemy had now been achieved. The Russians withdrew in two groups both east behind the Bug and north to Zamosc. The 3rd Army entered the operational area of the Russian Northwestern Front. Thus, the offensive that began on May 2 in West Galicia and continued persistently for almost two months found its culmination in the breakthrough through the enemy army front. Field Marshal von Mackensen sought to exploit this now clearly recognized situation for the continuation of the pursuit and as a possible advantage. He decided to make the Russian position on the Tanew section untenable by advancing his left army wing northwest towards Zamosc and to assist the neighboring Austro-Hungarian 4th Army thereby regaining full freedom of movement.</body>\n",

Accordingly, the 11th Army also intended to continue its advance northwest on June 29. Meanwhile, it was known that its right wing, from which seven infantry divisions and a cavalry division were already used for securing the Bug or against it, would have to be led even more to the northeast and allocate further forces for the task of flank protection. This threatened to stall the entire pursuit operation of Field Marshal von Mackensen. It was therefore high time that decisive measures were taken to relieve the 11th Army of the concern for its right flank.\n",
      "In the instructions issued by the Austro-Hungarian command on the evening of June 22, the 11th and Austro-Hungarian 4th Army were tasked with pursuing the enemy retreating north. A far-reaching operation was apparently not yet considered. Again, as in mid-month, it was the Chief of Staff of Field Marshal von Mackensen, Major General von Seeckt, who now suggested expanding the pursuit task into a new decisive offensive. On June 24, he presented the allied army commands with a detailed assessment of the situation, in which he initially described the \"actual war aim on the eastern front as the imminent complete subjugation of Russia.\" He then continued:\n",
      "\"The southern Russian front is defeated. The northwestern half is undefeated. It can only be defeated if it is forced to abandon its strong front and is enveloped from the south while retreating. How sensitive this pressure is to the enemy is evidenced by the fact that even in the occupied front position of the 4th and the left half of the 11th Army to the north, the enemy began to abandon its position in the Vistula-San triangle also against the 1st Army and Bavarian. This invites even more to carry out the thrust on the right Vistula bank east of Ivangorod with strong force. It will throw the entire Russian northwest front.</body>\n",

      "<body>In themselves, the forces of the 4th and 11th Armies, if not further weakened, will suffice. They would still grow if parts of the 1st Army were freed for use on the right bank of the Vistula. The prerequisite for the strength of the thrust is that it can be carried out without diverting forces to cover its right flank. One must consider the likely countermeasures of the enemy, who will hardly be ready to retreat behind the Bug. He will withdraw parts from the front or the right wing and immediately oppose them in a position between the Vistula and Bug, roughly along the Swangord—Wlodawa line. He will also throw available weak forces against the right flank of the advance, utilizing the rail connections via Brest Litowsk and Kovel. This development must be secured against. The Army High Command¹) has already recognized this necessity at the outset by directing the left wing of the 2nd Army to Kaminoka Strumilowa. I believe it is necessary to already consider redirecting the 2nd Army in this direction. The Besziden Corps is not sufficient for this if the advance of the right wing of the 11th Army extends over Belz to Hrubieszow and Cholm. Otherwise, it must be kept further back and not lose the strength of the front through lateral expansion. It is therefore requested to consider whether the 2nd Army should not join the advance in a northerly direction in echelons from the left wing in the general direction of Vladimir Volynsk. If the presumed influence from the east remains, this advance direction already results in bypassing an enemy position leaning on the Bug at Wlodawa and later covering against Brest Litowsk. For the final evacuation of Galicia and the continuation of operations against the Russian 8th and 9th Armies, the forces of the 7th and the now reinforced Southern Army should suffice, perhaps with the addition of the V Army Corps and Group Szurmay, while the 2nd Army with IV, XIX, and XVIII Army Corps turns north against the Radziechow—Krystynopol line.

Furthermore, Generaloberst von Conrad, disregarding the admonition of General von Seeckt, adopted a new operational idea by suggesting the cooperation of the front of the High Command East, \"to strike the main Russian force and push the enemy back behind the Vistula.\" For this purpose, he recommended an attack from the area of the army group Gallwitz, which was to be reinforced by contributions from other front sections, in the general direction of Siedlce. He envisioned, as he wrote, that operation \"which was initiated by us at the beginning of the campaign, but at that time could not penetrate due to the Russian superiority and the absence of the German thrust on Siedlce.\" General von Falkenhayn's view initially differed in some points from these proposals of the 8th and General Staff Chief. His position is evident from the draft of an operations order, which he sent to Teschen on the morning of June 28 with the addition that it would be advisable to issue this order to the armies immediately, should Generaloberst von Conrad approve it. General von Falkenhayn was indeed in agreement with retaining the XXXXXI Reserve Corps within the 11th Army.\" However, since this had already been withdrawn to Jaroslaw at the time, it was initially not considered as flank protection for the 11th Army. For this purpose, the German Chief of Staff rather considered the immediate advance of the k.u. 2nd Army against the Bug line Busk—Sokal necessary. To the right of it, the Southern Army was to continue its advance over the line Brzezany—Krasne (south of Busk) eastwards without pause and secure its right flank against the section of the lower Lota Lipa. To support it, the deployment of the last German division still in southern Hungary, the 103rd Infantry Division, via Delatyn and Stryj to Stanislau was envisaged. Also, the k.u. 7th Army was to advance without any reference with a strong left wing over the Dniester to the line Buczacz—Podhajce, while otherwise holding its positions from Bojan (east of Czernowitz) to north of Horodenka.</body>\n",

Overall, he had thus joined the proposals of General von Seeckt. Regarding the later planned regrouping of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army and the operational cooperation of parts of the Eastern Command, he refrained from making a statement.\n",
      "The existing differences of opinion were resolved through verbal discussions between the two chiefs of staff on the afternoon of June 28 in Plesz. General von Falkenhayn complied with all the wishes of Generaloberst von Conrad. The Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army was initially to advance only to the upper Zlota Lipa (including Dunajow) and to Buß—Kamionka Strumilowa (including) with strong reserves on the northern flank to secure the Bug line up to the confluence of the Rata. Thus, it was considered of lesser importance as flank protection for the 11th Army. Instead, Generaloberst von Conrad maintained his intention to continue advancing the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, that is, after breaking through the Russian position south of Kamien towards Tarlow, to lead it via Lemberg and then advance it over Radziechow—Sokal, ready to intervene to the left or right as needed. The advance of the Southern Army over the Gnila Lipa was initially to proceed only to Zlota Lipa down to Dunajow. Generaloberst von Conrad requested to refrain from bringing the 103rd Infantry Division from southern Hungary, as he still considered it indispensable on the Serbian front. The 7th Army was to continue securing the right flank and the temporary possession of Czernowitz. Overall, this meant that the eastward-facing covering front was only a spatially limited and temporary situation. The Woyrsch Army Detachment remaining on the left Vistula bank was to take over the entire front there up to the Pilica, exploiting any deviation of Russian forces for attack and following them to the Vistula.\n",
      "On the evening of June 28, orders were issued to all armies in this sense. In an accompanying letter to General von Seeckt, the head of the Austro-Hungarian Operations Office, Major General Metzger, justified the measures envisaged for the immediate flank protection of the 11th Army: \"... The reinforcement of the covering front against the three armies of the Russian Southwestern Front is intended to serve the purpose of forming an army remaining at the disposal of the Austro-Hungarian High Command, designated for operations east of the Bug, as the protection of the eastern flank of the 11th Army is only possible offensively in the long term.\"</body>\n",

A purely defensive flank protection on the Bug, Lipa, Dniester line is reliably not feasible with further advances of the 11th and 4th Army and could not be achieved by merely stretching the 2nd Army, which has very limited numbers, all the more so since it is assumed here that the enemy will bring troops from other front sections via Kowel—Wladimir Wolynsk and via Dubno—Brody, not only to close the connection of his 3rd and 8th Army but also to make the 8th Army capable of attack.\"\n",
      "The discussion of the general staff chiefs of the allies in Pleß on the afternoon of June 28 further created unanimity in the view that the participation of parts of the commander-in-chief East would decisively contribute to achieving a major operational success against the main Russian forces in Poland. In choosing the starting point and direction of an offensive from the German Eastern Front, for which various possibilities were considered, General von Falkenhayn still retained free hand, as he initially wanted to hear the opinion of Field Marshal von Hindenburg. In addition to the attack against the lower Narew recommended by Colonel General von Conrad, he also considered an advance along the Pilica up to beyond the Vistula as well as a simultaneous undertaking at or after Lublin. In this sense, he sent an inquiry to the commander-in-chief East on June 28 and requested his opinion.</body>\n",

The fronts lying \"between these focal points\" would be ruthlessly stripped of forces by the enemy and were already in the process of doing so. Therefore, one had to expect heavy fighting at the mentioned locations. However, the Chief of the General Staff hoped that Libau could be held for a longer time. Against Warsaw, he thought of advancing further with the help of the then impending gas attack. He wanted to bring relief to the situation in Galicia by attacking elsewhere indirectly.

      "On June 1, General von Falkenhayn requested not to reduce the 9th Army's strength in the near future, as \"in case of urgent need,\" all dispensable forces with it must be relied upon to use them \"in the south.\" The war diary of the Eastern Command also noted that a total of nine Russian divisions²) had now been transferred from their own front to the Galician front.

The Commander-in-Chief East assessed the prospects based on previous experiences as not so favorable and therefore replied on June 4: \"The armies under my command attack as much as possible. However, since I have to continuously release forces due to the overall situation, I currently have no sufficient reserves for an effective attack except with the 9th Army and north of the Njemen.\" General von Falkenhayn, who did not consider these explanations convincing, refrained from a rebuttal.

Such an offensive could have a decisive effect, leading \"on the shortest spatial route into the rear of the Russian army retreating from East Galicia between the Vistula and Bug.\" Precisely for this reason, however, \"serious resistance in the tactically already very strong and presumably also heavily occupied line Ostrowiec—Grodno\" was to be expected, and it was therefore very questionable whether the attack across the broad swampy lowlands of the Bobr could be successful. Before the Eastern Commander-in-Chief made a final decision, he consulted the chiefs of staff of the armies in question (Gallwitz Army Group, 8th, 10th, and Njemen Army) on June 30 in Lößen to hear about the attack possibilities in their sectors. Colonel Count von Schwerin explained for the 8th Army that the attack at Ostrowiec was not possible due to the terrain conditions; he recommended the offensive on Lomza and westward. However, this interim solution was not further discussed; rather, Lieutenant General Ludendorff decided in favor of the offensive in the Njemen area and the simultaneous execution of the surprise attack planned against Kowno.\n",

In the event of success, the troops can at best hold a more or less advanced bridgehead south of Osjowiec after the fall of Osjowiec. A continuation of the offensive towards Bialystok is not possible; the forces are insufficient, as it is certain that the Russians will concentrate forces there. Within the framework of the overall operation, this provides relief for other forces, but it does not lead to an immediate tactical cooperation that would crown a truly decisive operation.

To what extent the tactical success will lead the Njemen Army eastward, or towards Wilna, remains to be seen. The fact that the Russians have led very significant forces into the area north of the Njemen as soon as they felt a threat here makes it likely that they will again bring reinforcements against the Njemen Army from a northern part of their 2nd Army. This will relieve another part of the overall front as well as any potential operation at Osjowiec.

He thought, as he did then, initially only of immediate support for the offensive of Field Marshal von Mackensen through a tactical success on his own front, but not of a large own operation that could ultimately lead to a campaign decision against Russia in conjunction with that offensive. In his opinion, the forces were not sufficient for such a goal. Since the prospects for tactical success at the point where the strongest operational impact was expected, at Osowiec, were not favorable, he advocated for the attack at Kowno and northwards, which should \"bring relief at another point of the overall front.\" Only if the capture of the strong fortress Kowno succeeded, did he hope \"in further consequence for a great strategic success.\"\n",

      "<body>General von Falkenhayn, who had a discussion with Field Marshal von Mackensen in Rawa Ruska on July 1 and gained the impression that everything was progressing well there, arrived in Posen via Plesz on the morning of July 2. His view was as follows: The situation in the West seemed relaxed after the failure of the French-English attacks, but one had to be prepared for a repetition of similar breakthrough attempts. They could force the shift of the main focus of warfare back to the Western Front. Meanwhile, the strained situation of Turkey increasingly demanded active intervention against Serbia. How long the Austro-Hungarian military leadership on the Italian front would manage with the forces deployed there was uncertain, although all attacks had been repelled so far. Despite the great successes in Galicia and the currently favorable prospects of the Mackensen army group, it seemed necessary to continue the offensive against Russia with spatially and temporally limited objectives, so that the Supreme Army Command remained able to quickly redeploy strong forces to another front if necessary. The possibility of a quick conclusion to the now two-month-long Eastern operation was therefore urgently desirable. The necessary major military success seemed most safely and quickly achievable through the direct cooperation of the Mackensen and Hindenburg army groups in the area between the Bug, Vistula, and Narew.\n",
      "Based on these considerations, General von Falkenhayn firmly rejected an offensive over Kowno and northward, as the Eastern Commander-in-Chief apparently wanted to propose; he also had doubts whether any effect could be achieved on this path that would benefit the main operation. The experiences made in a similar attempt in the spring (February/March) seemed to argue against it. Even then, the Eastern Commander-in-Chief had harbored very far-reaching hopes, which were not fulfilled. A local tactical victory was not sufficient, \"especially not if, as in the present case, it ran the risk of dissipating in an eccentric direction and merely leading to greater dispersion.\"</body>\n",

However, it is not very likely that what is summarized there was fully discussed on July 2.\n",

      "ran the risk of dispersing in an eccentric direction and merely leading to greater expansion.\" The Supreme Army Command needed a success that promised quick and decisive effect on the struggle between Bug and Vistula. However, General von Falkenhayn did not expect such success from the operation via Kowno, even if a significantly larger increase in forces could be made possible for this front section than he considered permissible given the overall situation, and even if this would enable the offensive of the left wing to continue in the direction of and beyond Vilna against the enemy's rear connections. \"The Russians had long recognized the dangers of operational envelopment ... and learned to apply countermeasures against it. Their use was facilitated by their numerical superiority, their more efficient railway network, and the ruthlessness with which they could and did, from experience, give up territory whenever it seemed expedient to them¹).\"\n",
      "Now Army Group Mackensen had received orders on June 28 to advance against the Russians between Bug and Vistula²); the operational direction of the Supreme Commander East had initially been left open. Meanwhile, General von Falkenhayn had decided, in line with Conrad's plan³), for the offensive from the area of Army Group Gallwitz against and across the lower Narew, with the further goal of a thrust passing east of Warsaw⁴). He had abandoned earlier concerns about this operation across the \"swamp section\" of the Narew, as the lowlands would \"soon be passable everywhere\"⁵). The German Chief of General Staff envisioned as the ultimate goal to compress the enemy masses in Poland through simultaneous pressure from the south and northwest and, if possible, to cut off their retreat. A decisive victory over these significant enemy forces was intended to increase and expand the already apparent shock to the Russian army in Galicia to such an extent that it would be incapable of offensive action for a long time; such an effect seemed to him the highest achievable with the available means in the foreseeable future, and \"a fully sufficient success for the purposes of the Supreme Army Command.\"\n",
      "Accordingly, the Chief of General Staff gave a presentation to the Kaiser at the Royal Castle in Posen and recommended \"the cooperation of Hindenburg's forces in favor of the operation on the eastern bank of the Vistula from the area of Przasnysz and not from Kowno.\"\n",

      "<body>on the eastern bank of the Vistula from the area of Przasnysz and not from Kowno.”1) The Kaiser shared this view. Given the overall situation and the specific conditions of the Russian theater of war, he was also of the opinion that the attack over the Narew offered far better prospects than at Kowno. After the presentation by General von Falkenhayn, the Kaiser received Field Marshal von Hindenburg and Lieutenant General Ludendorff. The Commander-in-Chief East presented the overall situation in the East and his intentions in accordance with General Ludendorff's memorandum in the presence of General von Falkenhayn. It was the first time since winter that he had the opportunity to present his views on the major operations to the supreme warlord. He proposed the offensive of the reinforced Njemen Army with a simultaneous attack against Kowno; in response to the Kaiser’s objections, he conceded that it was “more a matter of feeling whether to attack at the Narew front or north of the Njemen.”2) He believed he was acting for the benefit of the whole by temporarily abandoning resistance to the intentions of the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army to avoid further unwanted friction, in order to resume his own plan at a given time.\n",
      "Then the Kaiser elaborated on his intentions, “with which” — as Colonel General von Plessen wrote at the time — “the decision for the offensive from the area of Przasnysz was made.” In any case, due to proximity, the impact is felt more noticeably and quickly than it can be from Kowno.”\n",

Accordingly, regarding the exposure of the front west of the Vistula, he arrived at a different conclusion concerning the allocation of forces for the Narew attack than the Supreme Army Command might have wished. These differences of opinion did not come to open expression; rather, General von Falkenhayn essentially accepted what the Commander-in-Chief East considered correct.\n",
      "The 8th Army was to join the attack of the Gallwitz Army Group. Furthermore, as General von Falkenhayn wrote after the war, \"the attention of the Commander-in-Chief was directed to the necessity of temporarily involving all forces otherwise available at his front\" in the Narew operation. Until this was carried out, \"all operations not directly serving security purposes, even in the north, should be postponed. On the other hand, it would be advisable to make preparations for a rapid shift of troops from the Narew Group to the north for a later attack.\"\n",

The Commander-in-Chief East instructed the Gallwitz Army Group to break through the Russian positions on both sides of the Narew with precision and to advance against the Bug to relieve the Mackensen Army Group. The cutting off of enemy forces located at the Vistula and in the north should not have been considered, as it was evident that this not precisely thought-out formulation is at least doubtful whether \"cutting off the enemy masses\" was even mentioned when the order was given, thus intended, as the goal of the attack.

Under the first impression of that decision, he sent a message to the 10th Army on July 2, stating that the Supreme Army Command had ordered to refrain from the intended attack on Kowno. However, he could not bring himself to completely abandon the attack prepared north of the Njemen.

East of the Szkwa, the right wing of the 8th Army extended in a 70-kilometer width to the Bohr below Ostrowiec, which, with a total deployment of four divisions, included some additional powerful divisions.

      "In the evening, Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann, who had remained in Lötzen and was informed by telephone about the outcome of the Potsdam meeting, communicated to the Gallwitz Army Group what the Eastern High Command was planning. The breakthrough target was Siedlce; in this direction, the advance was to be made \"by the shortest route\" from the left wing. Such an attack led via Ostrolenka over the Narew. \"The bold idea,\" — as General von Gallwitz wrote after the war — \"to advance directly deep into the enemy's rear — Siedlce was 140 kilometers from my front — occupied me intensely.\" For such a far-reaching undertaking, the reinforcement by the envisaged XVII Army Corps alone seemed insufficient. Also, the \"extremely difficult\" terrain between Orzyc, Omulew, Rozoga, and Szkwa with the river barrier lying just behind it, the Narew at Ostrolenka and Nowogrood, was not very suitable.</body>\n",

General von Gallwitz was in agreement with his Chief of Staff, Colonel Marquard, \"of the opinion that before such a deep thrust, a reckoning with the opponent facing Prasznysz, the Russian 1st Army and especially its core, the 1st Siberian Corps, must take place, and from this a development further west would be preferable for tactical and terrain considerations.\" This view corresponded to the attack plan against the area of Prasznysz, which General von Gallwitz had already presented to the Commander-in-Chief East on June 28 and which was then included in General Ludendorff's memorandum. He now found the approval of the Commander-in-Chief East, who considered it risky, given the difficulty of the task, to bind an experienced army leader too much in execution. On the morning of July 3, Lieutenant General Ludendorff informed the Gallwitz High Command that \"the goal of Siedlce should initially be set aside, a tactical success must absolutely be in the foreground,\" if it had a far-reaching effect.

Army Detachment Woyrsch covers against Iwangorod and Pilica estuary and will follow in this direction if the enemy retreats. — 2.) 9th Army is initially to occupy Poland left of the Vistula while holding the left wing on the Vistula in case of need, abandoning the connection with Army Detachment Woyrsch. If the 2nd Russian Army retreats, the 9th Army is to follow and achieve the closure of Warsaw-Nowogeorgiewsk from the left Vistula bank. — 3.) The main focus of the army lies with the Gallwitz Army Group. After receiving reinforcements, it is to break through and defeat the Russian 1st Army and continue to advance against Nowogeorgiewsk—Szkwa estuary, exerting decisive pressure to extend against this line of the Russian northwest front.\n",

      "On July 4, Lieutenant General Ludendorff arrived at the army headquarters in Soldau to discuss the situation and intentions with General von Gallwitz. There was \"unanimity about the procedure to be followed, with General Ludendorff favoring the advance against the Narew line Pultusk—Rozan (not Ostrolenka). He secured ammunition in masses.\" The attack day was initially set for July 11.\n",
      "On July 5, General von Gallwitz issued the basic instructions for the attack. They corresponded to the already mentioned Marquardt memorandum on attack procedures, which among other things demanded a vigorous approach to breakthrough. The heavily fortified Przasnysz was to be bypassed initially to bring it down more easily after taking the high ground west and east of the city. This resulted in two separate sections over a total attack width of about 36 kilometers, with Przasnysz in the middle. In these, three corps with a total of seven divisions were to attack in the first encounter, with an eighth division following behind the center. The troops of the neighboring sections, including two active divisions east of the Orzyc, were to tie down and distract the enemy with their own operations and join the attack.\n",
      "When on July 6 the transport of three Russian corps from northern Poland became known, the Eastern Commander-in-Chief also assessed the attack prospects more favorably. \"The Russian now has hardly any forces left to counter a breakthrough frontally and by flanking attack,\" it says in his war diary. The following day he expressed concerns about whether the attack was too broad.\" General von Gallwitz held to his plan; he considered \"the number of attacking troops sufficient; even though the enemy positions were magnificently developed, the occupation was no longer particularly dense after the withdrawal of the II Siberian Corps.\" Nevertheless, he decided to provide a Landwehr brigade behind the right and an active division behind the left attack wing from the reserves of the neighboring sections. An attack operation of the 10th Army and a new gas attack of the 9th Army were to contribute to distracting the enemy and fixing his forces; further operations, especially the offensive of the Njemen Army, were still pending. For the attack against Kowno, preparations were to be resumed, and the next freely available unit was to be sent there, even if its execution could not be considered initially. Otherwise, the attack planned for the right wing of the 8th Army meant the most immediate support for the Gallwitz Army Group.\n",
      "On July 9, the Eastern Commander-in-Chief reported to the Supreme Army Command in response to their inquiry: \"According to the instructions given to me on the 2nd of the month in Posen, the Gallwitz Group, reinforced by the XVII Army Corps, 38th Infantry Division, and all available artillery, will attack on both sides of Przasnysz and break through the Russian position. The right wing of the 8th Army will support the Gallwitz Group's offensive by attacking between Szdna and Pipja. The attack cannot begin before July 12 ... I had to postpone the operation against Kowno because troops are not available at the moment.\" Referring to this final sentence, General von Falkenhayn inquired about the use of the 41st Infantry Division, as the forces set for the Narew thrust seemed too weak to him. On his behalf, Major General Lappen arrived at the Eastern Commander-in-Chief in Lötzen on July 10. The strike group set through the Przasnysz area was now further reinforced by the 50th Reserve Division and the 9th Army, so that it now counted 10½ divisions. The 9th Army had thus given up a total of four instead of the originally planned two divisions.</body>\n",

      "At the front of the Army Group Gallwitz, the days since July 2 had quickly passed with preparations for the attack. Its start had finally had to be postponed to July 13. Since the foremost Russian line was in places up to 1000 meters away from the German front, the troops had needed time to advance — according to the views and combat conditions of the time — in nightly spade work to the storm distance of about 250 meters. The reinforcement divisions had therefore already had to move into their sections on July 8 and 9 and had since worked their way forward against the enemy. Deceiving the enemy about the attack intentions was thus almost impossible, especially since the camouflage of the inevitably extensive other movements and attack preparations was already extremely difficult due to the short duration of the summer nights.\n",
      "The enemy seemed to be standing in perhaps reduced strength, but otherwise unchanged in his previous positions. He lay in widely branched and deeply structured defense installations, which were arranged in groups but connected with continuous obstacles and seemed to be carefully expanded. Two position systems were to be distinguished. The front consisted of three positions, of which the third, running on average three kilometers behind the first, was formed only by a series of support points; in its middle, the town of Przasnysz was fortress-like expanded. In the line Ciechanow—Krasne lay a contiguous second position system, which was connected to the first by the barrier position Ciechanow—Przasnysz.\n",
      "The heights close behind the German positions offered the artillery good observation possibilities. The attack led west of Przasnysz over richly structured and often covered terrain, which east of Grudusk (heights 175 and 179) showed height differences of up to 50 meters; in the attack section of the left wing, the terrain generally showed simpler larger forms, but was more heavily wooded. On fields and meadows stood excellent grain or high summer grass. Only a single large road, which led most directly to the attack direction from Mlawa via Przasnysz and Makow to the crossroad Pultusk—Rozan, crossed the attack area; otherwise, one was dependent on pure natural paths.\n",

      "The total number of about 500 guns<sup>1)</sup> with around 400,000 rounds corresponded roughly to the deployment that had brought success at Gorlice, but by equipping the heavy field howitzer batteries with 1,000 rounds compared to only 600 at Gorlice, it gained even greater strength. This artillery, whose deployment was led by Colonel von Berendt as \"General of the Foot Artillery,\" was to fire as inconspicuously as possible, so that on July 13, after daybreak, as soon as observation was secured, the effective fire could begin. In the \"instruction\" given by General von Gallwitz, the long-time inspector of the German field artillery, to his troops, it was stated: \"Well-aimed, lively, and highly observed point fire. Large ammunition use in a short time, but no drumfire that excludes observation. The moral effect is lost if little is hit. Temporary increase of fire to strong fire waves to force the enemy to occupy his trenches in anticipation of the attack. Just before the assault, maximum fire increase, sudden forward shift on agreed signal, then advance. Artillery must provide the infantry with the necessary fire protection until the breakthrough. Immediately behind the last shell, the first man of the assault column must be in the enemy trench.\"\n",
      "General von Gallwitz wanted to personally lead the attack of the Plüskow and Pannewitz corps west of Przasnysz; his office was set up in Dzierzgowo behind Grudusk. The Plüskow corps had the task of indicating if anything protruded from the Russian front - the section Grundtke (inclusive) - Pandlowo - Koscielne (exclusive); this was a width of about seven kilometers. The Pannewitz corps was to conduct the \"main attack against the front Beroza (exclusive) - Height 154 east of Olziewic (inclusive)\"; this was a width of 4.5 kilometers. At 8 a.m., the infantry of both corps was to launch the assault and, if possible, reach the high positions on both sides of Czernice Borowe on the same day. On the eastern flank, Lieutenant General Freiherr von Bater was independently active and also had command over Division Fall. He was to attack the ten-kilometer-wide line Dłusnice - Stegna to break through the enemy front between Murawko and Orzyc; the line Bartniki - Dembiny was named as another target for him.\n",

The neighboring sections, especially the corps Surén to the west, were to deceive the enemy with minor operations and increased fire activity and were to be ready to advance later in connection with the assault group.\n",
      "Overall, it was estimated that in front of the seven attacking German divisions in the first line (each with nine battalions), there were about three Russian divisions (each with 16 battalions), and it was assumed that west of Przasnysz were parts of the I. Turkestan Corps, at Przasnysz and to the east the I. Siberian Corps, known throughout as combat-ready troops.\n",
      "For the continuation of the attack after the initial breakthrough, General von Gallwitz had ordered the corps Plüskow and Pannewitz. \"In exploiting the successes achieved to continue the breakthrough, I do not want to restrict the commanding generals, but I ask them to remain steadfastly straight within the strictly maintained combat zones. Careful consideration will be needed as to whether the attack on the second or third enemy position requires systematic preparation, which seems permissible for a staggered procedure. The more the enemy has suffered in the removal of the front line, the less his resistance will be in the next positions.\" Furthermore, General von Gallwitz intended to regulate the approach depending on the results of the attack from case to case; only after the removal of the positions of Sczernice Borowe and Bartniki—Dembiny should the attack be conducted from the northwest and northeast simultaneously against Przasnysz, which remains particularly important as a road junction. He also considered the possibility that the enemy, after breaking through his front lines, would retreat in such disarray that his rear sections could be overrun with rapid action. Even against Przasnysz, a coup de main can promise success if the Russians can no longer manage to gather sufficient forces to occupy the works.\"\n",
      "In poor weather and rain, the effective firing began on July 13 at 4 a.m. across the entire attack front; impaired observation seemed to affect the result. General von Gallwitz allowed the two corps of the right wing to delay the start of the assault by one hour.\n",
      "At the corps Plüskow, to whose support the heavy batteries of the 50th Reserve Division had also been advanced, the artillery effect seemed sufficient.</body>\n",

Meanwhile, Lieutenant General von Bernuth with the 86th Infantry Division took the advanced elevation northwest of Pawlowo Koscielne. General von Plüskow believed he had only weak enemy forces in front of him, but they fought well. He expected the enemy to hold the \"main position\" on the 20 to 30 meter high, partially wooded heights north of the Grunduß—Czernice Borowe road. The attack on this line was to be carried out in coordination with the Gallwitz High Command, systematically under new artillery preparation. By noon, the Plüskow Corps had already reached the northern edge of those heights.\n",

The left wing east of Czerwinice remained — as ordered — waiting. At 12°, General von Pannwitz designated the southern edge of the forest north of Czernice—Olszewice as the next target.\n",
      "The Watter Corps, which had advanced at 8:42, also had good initial successes. On the right, the 26th (Württemberg) Infantry Division under Lieutenant General Wilhelm Duke of Urach captured the fortifications of Osowiec.

      "At 3:30 in the afternoon, the attack on the right wing was reorganized. The Plüskow Corps received the high ground immediately south of the Grudusk—Czernice line as the day's objective; the following Pfeil Brigade was made available to cover the flank during further advances. The Pannwitz Corps, which was later tasked with turning southeast against Przasnysz and thus significantly extending its front, was assigned the 35th Infantry Division, thereby reuniting the XVII Army Corps.\n",
      "During the afternoon, the advance slowed. The movement of artillery required time, and the strength of the infantry advancing from line to line began to wane. General von Plüskow had temporarily halted his 38th Infantry Division south of Grudusk to wait until the 86th Infantry Division reached the Grudusk—Czernice road. At 1:30 in the afternoon, he learned from the 38th Infantry Division that the enemy held Lysaftowo; the others were reportedly \"in full retreat against the third position lying south of the main road.\" When the road was reached by the 86th Infantry Division in the afternoon, the commanding general ordered a new attack. After initially good progress, the enemy artillery fire intensified; the enemy seemed to have settled again. From Lysaftowo, he attacked the flank of the 38th Infantry Division. The German infantry laboriously advanced further and took the strong positions of Pziszcoli Gorne in the evening after the deployment of the Pfeil Brigade. However, the German artillery effect suffered from continuous rain and poor observation. Thus, the attack against the Russian third position, otherwise from Lysaftowo and at the southern edge of Czernice, came to a halt. Artillery firing and storming were postponed to the morning of July 14.\n",

It was already getting dark when the 1st Guard Reserve Division took Chojnowo at 9 o'clock in the evening; the strong position northeast of the place could only be wrested from the enemy by the 35th Infantry Division in a devastating attack at 10 o'clock. Thus, despite all the dedication of the troops, they did not get beyond the line Chojnowo—German starting position at Mchowo on this day and were still about five kilometers away from Przasnysz.\n",
      "The General Command Watter had the impression at 3 o'clock in the afternoon that the enemy was retreating everywhere and only offering resistance with rearguards at some points. However, progress was slow due to rain and forest fighting. The enemy seemed to be receiving reinforcements.

On the left wing, the division of Lieutenant General von Fall had entered the front line; the wide meadow depression of the Orzyc offered protection to its eastern flank.\n",
      "The overall result of the first day of attack did not quite meet the high expectations of the morning and midday hours, although the breakthrough into the enemy positions west of Przasnysz had reached a depth of up to six kilometers, east of the place up to 4½ kilometers. The two front positions of the Russians were breached at two points over a width of 15 kilometers each, and at many points the third position was reached; at Czernice, all Russian battery positions were taken.

The Watter Corps was to reach the Bartniki—Dronzczewo road, ready to assist against Przasnysz later if needed. The order further stated: \"If the enemy retreats at night, all corps will relentlessly follow in their combat zones.\" These ran against the second line of Russian defenses, specifically for the Plüskow Corps on Opinogora and east, for the XVII Army Corps on Zielona and east to Bogate, for the Watter Corps east of the Wengierka.\n",
      "The battle continued through the night in some places. The divisions of the Plüskow Corps had mostly already reached their first target for July 14. At dawn, the attack continued along the entire breakthrough line. Soon, however, it became clear that only rearguards were facing them. Pilots, who had been on the move since 3 a.m. and advanced deep into the hinterland, found the roads, especially the main road Przasnysz—Makow—Pultusk, covered by southward-moving vehicle columns; magazines went up in flames. The enemy was in full retreat; even Przasnysz was evacuated.</body>\n",

General von Gallwitz sent them the directive as early as 9 a.m.: \"The pursuit idea must remain the guiding principle in the next operations. Enemy rear guard positions must be attacked and overrun without delay.\" The barrier position along the Ciechanow–Przasnysz road was taken without delay. At noon, General von Gallwitz reported to the Eastern Commander-in-Chief the further intention: \"Advance the army against the last occupied section Ciechanow–Bogate–Krasnosielc, which is to be attacked.\" Meanwhile, the enemy had also begun retreating in front of the entire western flank of the army group. The corps Dickhuth and Surén followed. East of the Orzyc and in front of the 8th Army, the Russians still held.\n",
      "In dull and rainy weather and consequently muddy roads, the three corps of the German breakthrough front approached the Russian second line of defense in the early afternoon hours. Some advanced positions were taken. General von Gallwitz, who personally led the two corps advancing west of the Wengierka, considered postponing the attack to the next morning, but then let the corps begin when they wanted to take the Russian positions in the evening before the enemy brought reinforcements. However, the attempts had to be abandoned because the artillery did not achieve sufficient effect under unfavorable observation conditions. At nightfall, the attackers were positioned everywhere close to the enemy positions, ready to attack. Behind the Plüskow corps, the 50th Reserve Division had moved up, and the 36th Infantry Division had been withdrawn as a reserve at the XVII Army Corps.\n",
      "The attack of the Watter corps also came to a halt in the evening after insignificant individual successes against strong Russian resistance. The enemy stubbornly held his fortified positions from Bogate to Drozdowo on the western bank of the Orzyc. The corps had gradually swung southeast and extended its left wing with landwehr, as the enemy on the right bank of the Orzyc in front of the corps and in front of the 8th Army was still in the old positions.\n",
      "On the western flank of the army group, the Surén corps had been able to follow the retreating enemy. In doing so, the 85th Landwehr Division had approached the positions of Ciechanow. The fighting continued here into the darkness. Further west and with the Dickhuth corps, they had reached the line running over Plonsk to Wyszogrod on the Vistula, reaching the Russian second line of defense up to eight kilometers, but also stood partly further away from it.</body>\n",

      "Overall, the attack of the Army Group Gallwitz had advanced 10 to 15 kilometers in two days. The loot had increased to 7100 prisoners, and the own losses were moderate at 2700 men. It turned out that the fight had so far been mainly against the 11th and 2nd Siberian Divisions. However, it was also necessary to reckon with the full force of the 1st Siberian Division held in reserve, as well as reinforcements that were rushing in by rail and foot march according to aerial observations. A possibly heavy new attack was imminent; however, there was no doubt about its outcome after the previous successes.\n",
      "The infantry of the German assault corps moved closer to the enemy positions on July 15th under cover of darkness; at dawn, the artillery began firing. It turned out that they had quite strong, well-protected installations in front of them. The attack task seemed not much inferior to that which had been solved on July 13th after the most thorough preparation by completely fresh troops; however, the forces were not sufficient to carry it out across the entire width of the front. General von Gallwitz pointed out to the two western corps 11 and 17 that the enemy was bringing up reinforcements, and that it was therefore necessary to attempt a breakthrough through the enemy position at one point today if possible. Since this seemed to be the least strongly developed according to the results of the aerial reconnaissance in the area of Zielona, he wanted to strike here.\n",
      "General von Plüskow prepared the incursion on his left wing in the area west of Zielona, General von Pannwitz on his right wing east of the mentioned place. While the artillery concentrated its fire on these positions, the flyers reported further unloading of Russian reinforcements at Nasielsk and northwards, which were marching on Pultusk and Ciechanow. Under these circumstances, General von Gallwitz gave the corps the instruction that now, as they had the last enemy position in front of them, it was no longer a matter of deep penetration, but of quickly swinging in to unroll the Russian lines. Between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, the 1st Guard Reserve Division under Major General Albrecht succeeded in breaking through in the area of the bridge southeast of Zielona; it was quickly expanded eastward with the help of parts of the 36th Infantry Division. This division itself was inserted between the 1st Guard Reserve and the 35th Infantry Division to break through in the direction of Wenzewo on the way to Pultusk.</body>\n",

Parts of the 50th Reserve Division had already been involved here; now this entire division was inserted to break through to Kolaczkowo. Meanwhile, at 5 p.m., the 38th Infantry Division under Major General Schultheiß also broke into the stubbornly defended Russian position at Dipinogura further west; the enemy retreated from here to Ciechanow.\n",
      "At 6 p.m., General von Gallwitz ordered the two western corps: \"If the rolling up of the enemy position has led to the enemy clearing the entire line,\" the Plüskow Corps should proceed south to Gontz—Ciechanow, the XVII Army Corps should turn southwest to Karniewo—Makow, and the 50th Reserve Division should fill the gap between them towards Stary Golynin. He was able to report to the Commander-in-Chief East at 6:15: \"The fortress-like last enemy position Ciechanow—Krasnosielc has been broken through after a hard fight at Zielona over about seven kilometers, five large strongpoints taken.\" However, he also had to draw attention to the beginning difficulties in the supply of ammunition.\n",
      "On the outer flanks of the two corps, north of Ciechanow and at Bogate, the enemy still offered stubborn resistance, against which, in the spirit of General von Gallwitz, the Plüskow Corps turned right, the XVII Army Corps turned left, while in the direction south only the 50th Reserve Division under General of Cavalry Baron von der Goltz continued; here the entire Russian 30th Division of the IV Corps, which had arrived by rail, was identified as a new opponent. The unloading at the Warsaw railway continued, and new enemy forces marched on the road Rozan—Makow. General von Gallwitz therefore repeatedly urged vigorous pursuit and rolling up of the parts of the Russian front still holding at Bogate. He wanted to \"personally reap the immediately beckoning fruits of victory\" and hoped, above all, through the cooperation of the Plüskow and Surén Corps, to perhaps catch the Russians at Ciechanow.\n",
      "Despite the fatigue of the troops, movements and battles continued partly deep into the night, but without reaching the set goals. The Plüskow Corps reached the road Ciechanow—Pultusk only at the road junction Pomorze with a detachment set to interrupt the Warsaw railway, but remained with the 38th and 86th Infantry Divisions on average still about three kilometers away from it.</body>\n",

This was partly due to the fact that the German attack on the east bank of the Wengierka had fallen about two kilometers short.\n",
      "The four divisions of Lieutenant General von Watter faced an opponent who held tenaciously in strong positions everywhere. The general planned attack ordered for July 15th led only to local successes.

      "believed that the attack would penetrate the Russian position network so quickly. The question arose in which direction the operation should be continued.\n",
      "Within the framework of the overall situation in Poland, the purely frontal retreat of the Russians towards Wyszogrod—Plonsk—Makow had no decisive significance yet. Left of the lower Vistula, their front had long been pushed back before the German 9th Army up to the height of Wyszogrod; it would only become untenable when the Narew Line itself fell. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the month, there were signs that the Russians also wanted to withdraw left of the Vistula, initially into the Grojec—Blonie position, which offered a completely secure connection to the Narew Line in the strong cornerstone of Nowogeorgiewsk. Aerial reconnaissance, intercepted radio messages, and prisoner statements consistently gave the impression that the systematic evacuation of the area west of the Vistula was being initiated. Extensive destruction measures appeared to be underway; villages were going up in flames; the population, it was said, was being evacuated. Two Russian corps (VI Siberian and IV) had been withdrawn; the positions in front of the southern wing of the 9th Army were supposed to be significantly weaker than before. Thus, the possibility had to be considered at any time that the enemy might withdraw before the 9th Army. Whether he would then try to continue holding the Grojec—Blonie position in the south and the Narew Line in the north in connection with the large and strong fortress Nowogeorgiewsk, or whether he would soon retreat further under the pressure of Army Group Mackensen's offensive, which was to be continued between Bug and Vistula after a temporary standstill¹) — it remained important that Army Group Gallwitz's thrust hit as deep as possible into his rear, thus maintaining an eastward direction in the continued attack.\n",
      "In contrast, General von Gallwitz intended to advance with his main forces in the direction of Pultusk—Rozan; the Eben Corps was to cover against Ostrolenka, which he hoped would be attacked by the 8th Army. In a telephone conversation about this question, General Ludendorff, now that the enemy positions had been penetrated in their entire depth, wanted the decisive attack to be \"directed more towards Ostrolenka and in return rather give up terrain at the Vistula.\" General von Gallwitz considered such an extension of the attack too broad; given the current situation, Rozan was the most easily attackable point. An extension to Ostrolenka would bring us before a more solid position and before the undefeated troops of the IV Siberian and V Corps.\n",

When he finally posed \"the specific question\" of whether he should attack Ostrolenka, \"the Field Marshal, who was with Ludendorff, immediately granted him freedom of action; the latter also agreed\"1). The decisive factor was that even now, the primary goal was the tactical success, the conquest of the Narew line. However, General Ludendorff also wanted to give the Gallwitz High Command, in which he had confidence, as much freedom as possible in its decisions2). Thus, it remained with its intentions.\n",
      "After the movements were completed on the evening of July 15, General von Gallwitz assumed that the Russians would try to establish themselves in the line Nowogeorgiewsk—advanced positions from Pultusk—area of Bogate—Orzyc and hold this line, which was significantly shortened compared to earlier. He ordered the continuation of the attack in a southern and southeastern direction. For this, the left wing of the XVII Army Corps was to \"only engage\" the enemy in the strong positions of Bogate, primarily to allow the pivoting of the German right wing to take effect. On July 16, the enemy held close to the extended front of the corps and before the right wing of the Surén Corps, his prepared second line of defense; the striking power of these German troops was in no way sufficient to drive him out here by force. However, he had evacuated the town of Ciechanow, threatened by encirclement, during the night. The 86th Infantry Division of the Plüskow Corps was able to report capturing artillery as booty from their night advance. Further east, the enemy was retreating under rearguard actions. The corps, however, initially advanced southwestward as ordered, against the retreat routes of the enemy withdrawing from Ciechanow, managing to shoot down an attacking Russian cavalry brigade, and only resumed the decisive thrust towards Pultusk in the afternoon. Meanwhile, the enemy resistance had been able to strengthen again in connection with the still-held positions north of Golymin on one side and from Bogate on the other. By evening, the left wing of the corps again reached east of Somyn, and subsequently, the Plüskow Corps, whose center, fighting on the Pultusk road, had reached Stary Golymin, while its two wings were somewhat lagging.\n",

The situation temporarily appeared so favorable that General von Pannwitz wanted to redirect his corps eastward to outflank the enemy of Corps Watter. However, in the afternoon, they encountered very yielding new resistance on both sides of Krasne; it seemed that the enemy had received further reinforcements. It was only late in the evening that parts of the 36th and 35th Infantry Divisions managed to penetrate the northern part of the stubbornly defended location. South of Bogate, despite fierce Russian resistance lasting into the night, successes were also achieved; parts of the 35th Infantry Division crossed to the eastern bank of the Wengierka. Corps Watter encountered equally strong resistance, attempting to force the Orzyc crossing at several points simultaneously. The 26th Infantry Division could only reach the river with its left wing south of Podos. The 3rd Infantry Division took the crossing at this location after heavy, costly fighting but had to relinquish it again against newly emerging Turkestan battalions; it remained definitively in German hands only in the evening. The 4th Guard Infantry Division and the right wing of Division Falk could only reach the river on both sides of Krasnosielc and had to repel heavy counterattacks here in the afternoon, with the heavily fortified location of Krasnosielc forming the mainstay of Russian resistance.\n",
      "Between the upper Orzyc and Pissa, however, the enemy abandoned his defense front, held for months, on the night of July 16 and retreated over almost 60 kilometers in width. The left wing of Division Falk had crossed the Orzyc southeast of Dronzdzewo by noon in a broad front and was positioned on the eastern bank northeast of Krasnosielc by the evening of that day, ready to strike the Russians still holding at this location in the flank and rear the next morning. Corps Eben and the right wing of the 8th Army had also set out from their positions to pursue and followed the enemy halfway to Siedlanka.\n",
      "Much was gained, and yet the hoped-for larger territorial gain after breaking through the last prepared position of the enemy was temporarily achieved in the least operationally effective direction, against the northern front west of Pultusk. In the direction of Rozan, progress over the Orzyc was not made, and to exploit the situation between Orzyc and Pissa, the striking power of the German divisions following here in only a thin line was in no way sufficient.

      "<body>In the attack front, difficulties became noticeable. Although in the four days since July 13, only two of their divisions had moved slightly more than 30 kilometers, or 1½ days' marches, from their original positions, it was already noticeable that overcoming each new resistance required very large amounts of artillery ammunition, which, due to difficult road conditions, no longer reached the front in sufficient quantities. It was also always the same ten divisions that had now been attacking continuously for the fourth day, while their front had meanwhile extended from 40 to 50 kilometers. Fresh troops, which could give the attack new impetus and enable the formation of a focal point at an operationally decisive location, were lacking and were not yet in sight. It is to be assumed that if they had been present, the supply difficulties would have increased even more.\n",
      "To reinforce, the Commander-in-Chief East could only fall back on the 9th Army, which since July 10 had still counted two general commands with six divisions, including the 5th and 49th Reserve Divisions, otherwise replacement troops and Landwehr, and some Landsturm. If the enemy of this army was still at least significantly superior in infantry, there was currently no danger at their front. The longer and stronger the Russians remained at the Rawka and Bzura, the greater the result of the operation on Pullus* had to be. However, the Commander-in-Chief East had not yet intended to move all essential parts of the 9th Army to the breakthrough front Narew, but had assigned them the task of following the retreating Russians to turn against the Grojec—Blonie position and Nowogeorgiewsk and later against Warsaw. As the progress of the Gallwitz Army Group also made the retreat of the enemy from the 9th Army increasingly likely, he decided on July 16, if the enemy retreated here, to move forces of this army to the right bank of the Vistula. At noon, he ordered the newly formed 83rd Infantry Division from Landwehr and Landsturm posts of the previous Posen Corps to be assembled in the direction of Wyszogrod for crossing the river and to prepare the division forming the southern wing for transport. Later, he decided to also prepare rail transport for the 83rd Infantry Division to move them to Willenberg behind the eastern wing of the Gallwitz Army Group.

      "In front of the Army Group Gallwitz, the enemy had used the darkness to once again evade the German pressure on broad sections of the front. Resistance was only offered north of Pultusk and northwest of Rozan. These fortified bridgeheads of the Narew line seemed to be held; reinforcements were brought against them. At 8 o'clock in the morning, General von Gallwitz regulated the further advance of his corps. He intended to close off the northern front from Nowogeorgiewsk—Bzura with the right wing, and to advance with the center against the Narew section Pultusk—Rozan. For this, the Plüskow Corps, to which the 1st Guard Reserve Division was also to be transferred, was assigned to Pultusk, the XVII Army Corps against the Narew between Pultusk and Rozan, the Watter Corps against Rozan; the Falk Division was to retreat to the Eben Corps during further advances, which would then again have two active divisions and twelve Landsturm battalions. It was to close off Ostrolenka with its left wing. This command regulation for the left army wing somewhat took into account the view of the Commander-in-Chief East, who wished for the main focus to be shifted further east, but this weakened the striking power in the breakthrough direction Pultusk—Rozan. The army headquarters was moved forward to Lejtsin southeast of Przasnysz.\n",
      "During the day, the Litzthuy and Surén Corps reached as far as Wyszogrod—Nowe Miasto to the north, the Plüskow Corps with the center to just before the strongly fortified enemy positions of the northwest front of Pultusk. The temporarily held hope of perhaps achieving the goal with a coup here had to be abandoned after the reconnaissance results now available. On the left wing of the corps, the 50th Reserve Division faced fierce resistance at the crossroads of Karniewo. In a line running from here northeast to the mouth of the Wengierka into the Orzyc and further over the 70-meter-high fortified heights southeast of Podos (Height 171) to Jednoroje, the enemy had settled again.

The Watter Corps itself was held up at the Orzyc bridges destroyed by the enemy and could therefore only work its way to the new Russian positions southeast of Podosz by evening. In agreement with the Army High Command, the decision for the next day was expected from the 35th Infantry Division, which was to attack the flank and rear of the enemy. The enemy seemed to have received further reinforcements, which he threw into the battle as they arrived. At the Eben Corps, only the Fall Division advanced well. Otherwise, this corps and the right wing of the 8th Army could make only slight progress in the forest and swamp terrain east of Ostrolenka with many obstructed sand paths. General von Scholz wanted to resume the attack the following day also east of the Pissa.\n",
      "On the morning of July 18, the enemy had vacated his positions in front of the left wing of the Plüskow Corps, the XVII Army Corps, and the Watter Corps; contact with him was mostly lost. It gradually became apparent that the Russians had retreated in one move to the fortified area of Pultusk and Rozan and between both places against the Narew. The army order from the morning of July 17 had already taken this possibility into account. Thus, the German troops now followed up to the northwest and north front of the positions of Pultusk and Rozan. Between both places, they initially remained about six kilometers away from the Narew. On the left wing, the strength of the Eben Corps was not enough to push the enemy further back against Ostrolenka. Also, on the entire remaining front of the army group and with the 8th Army, there was a standstill, though only insignificant progress was made.\n",

At the same time, His Majesty expressed confidence that the thrust against the Narew would not come to a halt at this section, but rather that every effort would be made to advance it as quickly as possible towards the lower Bug.\" For the newly resumed offensive of the Mackensen Army Group, it was of utmost importance that no standstill occurred. Everything now depended on the success of quickly crossing the Narew in the direction intended by General von Gallwitz towards Pultusk—Rozan, with Rozan being, according to the General's view, \"the easiest point to tackle\" and also representing the more operationally effective direction. Any delay would benefit the enemy, who, as indicated by the targeting of his radio stations, was now constantly bringing in new forces. His XXI Corps from Galicia was identified as a new enemy at Rozan, the III Siberian Corps was supposed to be advancing from the Niemen Front, and it could easily free up additional forces from the area west of the Vistula, where, besides the German 9th Army, since July 17, the Woyrsch Army Detachment was also moving against Iwangorod. Meanwhile, the difficulties of the operation had grown to the point where a temporary standstill had to occur before the Narew line could be overcome. Bringing up ammunition and the heaviest artillery required a lot of time with increasing distance from the railway. By this day, July 18, the main railway line from Mława to Warsaw had been converted to German gauge and restored up to Ciechanow; field railways from Mława to Przasnysz and from Willenberg to Ostrolenka were under construction.\n",
      "In General Ludendorff's memorandum of July 1, it was stated: The Gallwitz Army Group \"could push the Russians back to the Pronsk—Pultusk line in heavy fighting.\" This goal was achieved in six days of struggle, even significantly exceeded on the flanks. The \"Pincer of Przasnysz\" had torn open the Russian first line of defense over a width of 40 kilometers, the \"Hammer of Ribik\" had also struck the decisive hole in the defensive line Ciechanow—Krasnosielc. The Russian front was breached to a depth of 30 kilometers.\n",

Whether the same result would have been achieved if the attack had been launched from the beginning with the operational goal of Siedlce, focusing on the left wing towards Ostrolenka, cannot be determined retrospectively. The battle against the I. Siberian Corps, considered the core of Russian resistance, would certainly have been easier, as it would not have been confronted frontally in its particularly strong defensive positions at Przasnysz, but its flank would have been gained, forcing it to fight in open field with a shortened front.

      "When the German attack broke out, the enemy was by no means as surprised as was assumed on the German side. He had already learned of the arrival of German reinforcements at Chorzele on July 6 through prisoner statements. In the following days, his ground and air reconnaissance noted, among other things, an increase in artillery, wagon trains, and the construction of supply railways; he concluded from these signs that a German attack was imminent. Almost every night brought individual prisoners. In doing so, the German XVII Army Corps, previously stationed at the Narew, was identified as a new opponent. On the night of July 11, it was finally determined that the Germans were approaching closer, and the width of the German attack was correctly assessed by the high command of the Russian 1st Army. It expected the start of the attack for July 12. On this day, the German artillery's firing made such a strong impression that July 12 was highlighted in the records of some units as a \"day of battle.\" However, their own defensive preparations were too late.</body>\n",

      "The Russian positions on July 13, as before, were occupied along the 40-kilometer-wide attack front by only two divisions: the 2nd Siberian of the 1st Siberian Corps to the east, and the 11th Siberian of the 1st Turkestan Corps to the west of Przasnysz, which together counted 32 battalions and about 100 guns. As a reserve, the 1st Siberian Division of the 1st Siberian Corps had been moved forward to Mlava on the night of July 12 and thus stood a strong day's march behind the front; behind the 11th Siberian Division, a Turkestan brigade had been set up as a reserve. Further forces were sought to be freed in more westerly sections.\n",
      "On July 13, the 2nd Siberian Division east of Przasnysz vigorously defended against the attack of four German divisions. In the area of Przasnysz itself, ½ of the 1st Siberian Division was inserted, west of the city the defense of the 11th Siberian Division was already withdrawn early into the intermediate position of Czernice before the attack of initially five German divisions. However, the resistance began to collapse here as well in the afternoon despite the deployment of the Turkestan brigade; parts retreated in dissolution. Meanwhile, the leader of the 1st Siberian Corps ordered the retreat into the second line of defense running over Krasnosielc—Podos to Bogate, and around midnight General Litwinow ordered the retreat of the entire army. They were to keep the mentioned line extended over Ciechanowo to Wyszogrod on the Vistula. The infantry of the 11th Siberian Division had shrunk from 14,500 to about 5,000 rifles, and the 2nd Siberian Division had probably lost a third of its strength. According to the Russian view, the advantage of the situation was not sufficiently exploited by the Germans on this day. Only because the Germans had repeatedly halted in the attack was it possible to organize the Russian troops, severely shaken by overwhelming artillery fire, for new resistance. In this context, the procedure of the Plüskow Corps, which continued the attack without interruption on the night of July 14, is presented by the Russians as particularly effective and therefore exemplary.\n",
      "By the evening of July 14, the 1st Siberian Corps (2nd Siberian Division on the right, 1st on the left) was ready for new defense from northeast of Krasnosielc, where it connected to the correspondingly bent-back western wing of the 12th Army, to west of Bogate. Here, the 30th Infantry Division of the IV Corps, brought in by rail, was already arriving, and the 14th Cavalry Division was positioned behind the front.

      "With the approach to the fortified Narew line, the Gallwitz Army Group faced a new task. It was necessary, in view of the defensive opponent, to force a crossing over a river whose defense could rely not only on some permanent works but also on field fortifications that had been expanded over months of work.\n",
      "The Narew itself was, without the smaller river loops, about 100 kilometers long between the Bug estuary above Nowogeorgiewsk and the bridgehead of Ostrolenka, a strong natural obstacle. In the summer of 1915, it was about 80 to 150 meters wide, with sandbanks in places and some bush-covered islands, and had a low water level after a dry spring. Very shallow fords were rare and variable in their location. On foot, one could wade through the river in many places; however, bridges were necessary for guns and vehicles. The lowland accompanying the watercourse in varying widths was almost everywhere dry and passable as the German troops approached.\n",
      "For the Gallwitz Army Group, it was necessary to overcome the extensive installations of Pultusk and the smaller ones of Rozan with the large fortress of Nowogeorgiewsk on the right flank, but if possible, to carry out the crossing over the river outside these two places. Pultusk, with its two old forts near the local bridge, was expanded into a spacious weapons site by about ten kilometers of advanced, deeply structured defense installations; at Rozan, which also had some old forts, the distance of the new installations from the bridge site was only about three kilometers. At both places, the heights of the western right bank approached the river flowing from north to south, while they were several kilometers away on the east side. The east-west running river chalk between the two places showed less pronounced height differences and was widely accompanied on both banks by a broad, simply wooded lowland. A similar picture was offered by the area above Rozan, at Ostrolenka, and towards Lomza.\n",

      "On the evening of July 18, General von Gallwitz issued an \"Instruction for the Attack on the Narew Front.\" General von Plüskow was to attack the \"northern part of the bridgehead\" of Pultusk with four divisions, including 56 batteries (18 of them heavy and 10 heaviest artillery), and with the 86th and the \"disposable parts\" of the 38th Infantry Division to the west, with the 50th and the 1st Guard Reserve Division east of the road from Ciechanow, here \"mainly the part leaning on the Narew.\" The attack of the XVII Army Corps was to \"initially aim at creating efficient crossings and securing them\" between Pultusk and Rozan. It was said to be \"conducted in such a way that the bridgehead can be achieved under the protection of previously prepared strong artillery at two places simultaneously and surprisingly, while at several other places the enemy is misled by simultaneously intended crossing points appearing as feigned attacks and Lachy,\" but reconnaissance was to provide confirmation first. A division was to be assigned to each crossing point. The Eben Corps with three divisions, including 39 batteries (eleven of them heavy and one heaviest artillery) was designated against Rozan and was to lead the main attack against the western front. The attack on the two fortresses was to be initiated by the corps and carried out according to the progress made; General von Gallwitz wanted to determine the timing for the attack of the XVII Army Corps himself. The neighboring corps, the XVII Reserve Corps and the Eben Corps, were to engage the enemy in front of their front and thus cover the flanks of the attack.\n",
      "On July 19, the situation on the right wing of the army group remained unchanged. The center moved closer to the indicated positions and the Narew without significant fighting. At the High Command, the idea of breaking through the river between Pultusk and Rozan and thereby primarily bringing Pultusk down came more and more to the fore.\n",
      "General von Plüskow intended to lead the main attack against Pultusk from the northwest. General von Gallwitz, however, placed particular emphasis on ensuring that also a forward position on the northern front at Chmielewo on the Narew be attacked to cross the river at the loop extending far to the north and to seize Pultusk from the rear; he wanted the focus of the attack to be shifted more to the east.\n",

      "In anticipation of the 83rd Infantry Division rolling towards Willenberg, General von Gallwitz intended to soon pull the active troops of Corps Eben to the right to force the Narew crossing between Rozan and Ostrolenka. The Commander-in-Chief East promised further reinforcements with the Menges Division, which General von Gallwitz requested behind his right wing to Mlawa, as well as the airship Z 12, which was to attack the enemy unloading stations. He also ordered the 8th Army to pull a division with strong artillery to its right wing upon reaching the Narew bank, to act against Ostrolenka or to cross the river at the Rozoga mouth. He also demanded a closer approach of the right wing of the Gallwitz Army Group to the Narew and the positions of Nasielsk, where the enemy seemed to be evacuating his XXVII Corps.\n",

However, General von Pannwitz had ordered his right 36th Infantry Division to move east from the area just east of the Orzyc estuary behind the 35th Division, to cross the river bend at Ostrołęk, which juts out the furthest against the enemy, on the left flank of the corps. But here the enemy still stood on the right bank, which he also attacked before the 36th Infantry Division arrived, with strong forces advancing from the east south of Rozan, with weaker parts also from the south west of Lachy, crossing the river and pressing the right flank of the Bülow Corps, but especially the XVII Army Corps. Further Russian forces simultaneously advanced west of the Orzyc estuary and from the northern front of Pułtusk against the left flank of the Plüskow Corps.\n",
      "This led to a series of partially stubborn battles. General von Plüskow moved the bulk of the 38th Infantry Division as a reserve from his right flank behind the left; he also believed he could not do without the cooperation of the 42 cm guns against Pułtusk now. At the XVII Army Corps, the situation looked serious at times; in the afternoon, General von Pannwitz had already deployed his last reserves and requested reinforcements. Only in the evening did the situation appear restored everywhere; the large river bend south of Rozan remained in enemy hands, with about one Russian infantry division and one cavalry division involved in the fighting here, with possibly somewhat stronger forces at Pułtusk. The own losses were considerable; the Plüskow Corps had captured about 1000 prisoners with the 1st Guard and the 50th Reserve Division together, but also lost about 600 men each. Additionally, a battalion of the 86th Infantry Division of the Plüskow Corps, which had three cholera deaths, had to be withdrawn from the front, and losses due to dysentery occurred.\n",
      "All in all, the previously high hopes were somewhat dampened by the day's events; it had shown that overcoming the Narew line would pose greater difficulties than expected. The enemy had increasingly shifted the focus of his defense to the Pułtusk—Rozan area. South and east of Pułtusk, the I Turkestan Corps seemed to be positioned, in Pułtusk itself the IV Corps, northeast of it at the Narew the 14th Cavalry Division and further back the I Siberian Corps, at Rozan the newly arrived XXI Corps, at Ostrolenka the IV Siberian Corps, while the XXVII Corps seemed to be advancing towards Bischöf. </body>\n",

      "After the vicissitudes of the day, the three German attack corps initially focused on Albeney for July 21. General von Gallwitz said to himself, \"that engaging the Narew front by the weak XVII Army Corps, before we firmly held the flanks, would offer no prospect,\" so there was no point in leaving parts of the corps in a vulnerable position in the Narew bend\"). He had it evacuated from Gostkowo to south of Rozan during the night.\n",
      "But even on the flanks of the army group, greater successes were initially not to be expected. Although the commanding general of the XVII Reserve Corps, Lieutenant General Surén, had left the garrison of Nowogeorgiewsk so small after the withdrawal of the Russian XXVII Corps that he wanted to attempt a coup de main with his Landwehr divisions, at least against the positions of the northern front. General von Gallwitz had initially agreed to this\"). In view of the strength of the fortress, he then doubted the success of such an undertaking; he considered it more appropriate, given the overall situation, to move the 83rd Landwehr Division of the corps to the east behind the right flank of the Plüskow corps. This also nullified the plan of Lieutenant General Surén. At the same time, the Commander-in-Chief East made the General Command of the III Reserve Corps, previously belonging to the 9th Army, available for unified leadership of the attack on the large Russian fortress. On the left flank, General von Eben wanted to carry out a feint operation on the Narew south of Ostrolenka on July 21, to then force the crossing at this place on the 22nd. But this plan also became obsolete, as General von Gallwitz ordered the main forces of the corps to be deployed north of Rozan. Thus, the last combat-ready parts of the army group were drawn to the actual breakthrough front, which thereby — without the forces still expected by rail (83rd Infantry Division and Division Menges) — reached a strength of twelve divisions.</body>\n",

The army reported that it had prospects of crossing the river at these two points and requested reinforcement of its right wing by a division. In view of the difficulties that had been shown to the Gallwitz Army Group, the Commander-in-Chief East temporarily considered continuing the 83rd Infantry Division, which was rolling towards Willenberg, to Kolno, but then abandoned this idea as it would have meant a dispersion of forces. He had firm confidence that the attack of the Gallwitz Army Group must succeed.\n",
      "On the morning of July 21, General von Gallwitz viewed the situation more calmly than under the impression of the evening news, but he believed he had to reckon with a repetition of the Russian attacks. On the other hand, he was clear that a prompt continuation of their own attack, which the Commander-in-Chief East repeatedly urged, was necessary. However, preparations had not progressed far enough at either the Plüskow Corps or the Watter Corps to ensure full success by July 22. Therefore, General von Gallwitz agreed that the attack at the Plüskow Corps should be postponed to the morning of July 23 and then carried out as far as possible in one go to the bridgeheads. Also, in front of Rozan, General von Watter wanted to take further measures on July 22 to carry out the attack against the inner line on July 23. Since the enemy between Pultusk and Rozan, where he also stood with parts on the right Narew bank as before, was now calm, the XVII Army Corps was also to attack again by forcing the crossing on the night of July 23, this time not again in the Ostrykol arc, but further west in direct connection with the attack of the Plüskow Corps. In addition, on the same night, the Eben Corps also wanted to fight for the crossing in the area north of Rozan, as did the 8th Army at the Szkwa estuary. Thus, the general attack in the entire 75-kilometer-wide area from Pultusk to the Szkwa was in prospect for July 23. The Gallwitz Army Command had been relocated to Krasne as early as July 21.\n",

The effective firing that began on the morning of July 23 from more than 200 guns (including about 80 heavy howitzers and 42 cm) was sharply concentrated against the intended breach point, one of which lay between the road from Stary Golynin and the Pelta, while the main attack was to take place along the road from Makow and to the east.\n",

      "Russian artillery barely responded. At 8:00 a.m., the 1st Guard Reserve Division under Major General Albrecht was the first to break into the northern front along the route from Makow, soon followed on its right by the 50th Reserve Division under General von der Goltz, and at 9:00 a.m. by the 86th Infantry Division of the XVII Reserve Corps under Lieutenant General von Bernitz, in whose area the 42 cm battery had been effective. However, it took hours before the entire northern front was taken. It was not until after 11:00 a.m. that progress was made on the road from Stary Golynin, and only after 12:00 was the large earthwork of Chmielewo over the Narew in the hands of the 1st Guard Reserve Division. General von Gallwitz ordered this division to halt so that it could immediately cross the river and, if possible, reach the road to Wyszkow behind Pultusk by evening. Moreover, the success achieved was to be exploited to the fullest extent to quickly capture the town and the crossings. All other considerations had to be set aside.\n",
      "However, it was not easy to achieve the set goal, as from the previous artillery setup only two flat-fire batteries, a 10 cm and a 13 cm battery, equipped with very few rounds, could act against the inner defensive line and the bridges located an average of six kilometers behind the front position. Thus, a completely new artillery deployment was necessary. Also, the attack of the 85th Landwehr, 86th Infantry, and 50th Reserve Division did not gain ground with the hoped-for speed. Parts of the 50th Reserve Division suffered significant losses, while others, when rolling up the Russian position, captured many prisoners but also lost time. Observations of the extensive forest areas hindered the rapid pursuit behind the enemy, whose retreat, according to observations by the aviators, was stalled at the bridges of Pultusk. However, it could not be effectively targeted by the German artillery. The aviators themselves were not equipped at the time to seriously disrupt it with bombing. The attack movement came to a halt in the evening before the inner defensive line, which, in connection with the two permanent works, directly covered the town of Pultusk and the crossing point and seemed strongly fortified. Forces capable of getting the attack going again were lacking, as the division Menges (Landwehr and replacement troops) assigned to the XVII Reserve Corps in the meantime was still 25 kilometers on the march, having been partially exhausted by a 40-hour train journey, so that their intervention could not be expected that day.</body>\n",

At dawn, the position should be breached.\" Meanwhile, the 1st Guard Reserve Division had brought infantry to the southern bank of the Narew at Chmielewo and Grojno. However, a bridge was not expected to be completed until 3 a.m., so the division could only advance into the rear of Pultusk then. This threat — General von Plüskow believed — would likely be avoided by the enemy through timely evacuation of the western bank.\n",
      "In the area of the XVII Army Corps, the Narew crossing by the 38th Infantry Division, which had driven the enemy from the northern bank the previous afternoon, was unsuccessful at Zambski. However, further east, the 36th Infantry Division under Lieutenant General von Heineccius, whose infantry partially waded through the river, reached the southern bank early on July 23 and advanced from there. By noon, the right wing of the 35th Infantry Division also managed to secure the southern bank, while infantry of the 38th Infantry Division crossed in the area of the 36th and then created space westward. The construction of bridges progressed slowly due to Russian counteractions. The 36th Infantry Division suffered such significant equipment losses that they had to rely on the bridge train of the 35th, delaying their construction again; the 38th Infantry Division could only begin construction at Zambski by evening.\n",
      "Nevertheless, by July 23, they had established a firm foothold on the 16-kilometer river stretch from Chmielewo to Binduga on the southern bank of the Narew and could begin constructing four bridges, including that of the 1st Guard Reserve Division. The apparently not very strong enemy stood close by, holding the right bank in the arc from Ostrolęka.\n",
      "At Rozan, General von Watter had intended on July 23 to fully occupy the positions of the Northwest Front. However, this partial goal was not fully achieved. As the enemy positions did not seem storm-ready everywhere, some strongly fortified installations north of the Pultusk road were taken; with very few own losses, 1100 prisoners were captured.

      "The 8th Army's operations against the Narew on July 23 had yielded no results.\n",
      "On the night of July 24, the expectations of General von Gallwitz were fulfilled. The Russians evacuated Pultusk and Rozan. Parts of the 86th Infantry and 50th Reserve Division had already moved into Pultusk during the night. By 5 a.m., the report was in the hands of the High Command, and by 6 a.m., the news followed that the advance troops of the 3rd Infantry Division had also entered Rozan. In both places, the bridges were destroyed, except for a military bridge and a footbridge just north of Rozan, which were under such heavy enemy fire that they could not be used for the time being. The Russians had set Rozan itself on fire during their retreat, similar to previous places; only about a third of the houses could still be saved. Pultusk, on the other hand, showed only minor damage.\n",
      "General von Gallwitz himself later judged the success: \"The famous Narew Line was taken after ample careful preparation, but ultimately after a short battle. What had not been considered about this problem in military literature and strategic tasks! It was something worth experiencing. However, eleven days had passed since the attack at Przasnysz, too much for the map distance. But what had the Russian piled up in works in this area to defend it? he mostly did!\" About 37,000 prisoners and 49 machine guns, but only 14 guns were the total booty since July 13, of which 8,500 prisoners, 49 machine guns, but not a single gun from the period since July 18. In the fortified bridgeheads of Pultusk and Rozan, only 3,600 prisoners were made together. The enemy had mainly occupied his extensive defensive installations on the right bank of the Narew with infantry alone for so long until they were shattered by the mass deployment of German artillery.\n",

      "General von Falkenhayn saw in the favorable course that the operations had taken since mid-July not only with Army Group Gallwitz but also with the Army Detachment Woyrsch²) and Army Group Mackensen³), promising signs for the maturation of the great success hoped for between the Vistula, Narew, and Bug. \"General von Falkenhayn brings good news. Everything is progressing in the East. In the West, the enemy is calm. ... Falkenhayn says it seems as if the campaign will now be decided in the East!\" — so wrote Generaloberst von Plessen in his diary on July 19. In such hope, the German Chief of General Staff had decided to bring in two more divisions from the West⁴). So far, all allocations from other theaters of war had been assigned to Army Group Mackensen. Since their further relocation did not seem advantageous due to long transport routes and difficult supply conditions, General von Falkenhayn inclined to assign the two divisions to the 9th Army so that they could advance between Iwangorod and Warsaw over the Vistula into the rear of the enemy still holding at the Narew. He then agreed to the proposal of Generaloberst von Conrad, who advocated deployment with Army Group Gallwitz. General von Falkenhayn therefore informed the Commander-in-Chief East on July 20: \"After the course of recent events, it is highly foreseeable that the decision in the campaign against Russia will fall in the area south of the Narew. In it, therefore, the deployment of even the last battalion, not absolutely necessary elsewhere, is justified and required. His Majesty has consequently ordered the deployment of the 54th and 58th Infantry Divisions as well as the Mortar Battalion No. 1 from the Western theater of war. The transport begins on July 20th.\"\n",

      "When this telegram reached the Commander-in-Chief East, it was 2 p.m.2). The enemy had evacuated the fort on the west bank of the Narew near Ostrolenka the previous evening, and the Gallwitz army group reported the first success against Rozan as well, but the severity of the subsequent Russian counterattacks over the Narew between Pultusk and Ostrolenka had not yet been recognized. The staff was still full of hope to quickly overcome the Narew line. To the left of the Vistula, the 9th Army was advancing against the Grojec-Blonie position3), the right wing of the Woyrsch army detachment4) was approaching the fortress of Iwangorod from the south. On the front from Lomza through Ostrowiec and Rowno to Schaulen, the situation was essentially unchanged; in the far north, the left wing of the Njemen army had come close to Mitau5).\n",
      "The Commander-in-Chief East, in contrast to the Supreme Army Command, was still of the opinion that the thrust over the lower Narew would remain operationally ineffective, and that the sooner, the better all available forces should be deployed at the Njemen, the retreat of the Russians on the left bank of the middle Vistula might have reinforced this view. Therefore, he had already assigned the surplus third brigade of the Menges division to the 10th Army the day before, to push further forward against the Njemen and Kowno, according to a diary entry by Major General Groener from that time, he was thinking of a \"breakthrough at Olita\". Only a success in the Njemen area now seemed to promise operational impact. The decision on the use and unloading stations for the divisions rolling in from the west was to be reserved by the Commander-in-Chief East until the beginnings reached the Vistula the day after tomorrow; by then he expected to have a clearer view of the further outcome of the attack on the Narew. Here he pushed sharply forward, also meeting the wishes of the Supreme Army Command. In this, General Ludendorff, in a telephone conversation with Major General Tappen, requested to postpone the decision on the deployment of the two western divisions until the morning of July 22nd, and expressed the conviction that the Gallwitz and Scholtz armies would smoothly cross the Narew and the Bug and exert the effect on the battles at Lublin demanded by the Supreme Army Command.</body>\n",

It seemed that the enemy was withdrawing forces from the 9th Army and thereby strengthening its Narew Front. Thus, the Commander-in-Chief East now considered a sharp attack by the army possible and necessary. He gave the order in the evening to break through the enemy positions on the left bank of the Vistula to cross the river above Warsaw³). He aligned with the thoughts of General von Falkenhayn⁴). He considered cooperating with the left wing of the Woyrsch Army Detachment and possibly also presenting this to the Supreme Army Command⁵). Meanwhile, he made the first arrangements for the encirclement of Nowogeorgiewsk.\n",
      "On the morning of July 21, the decision of General von Falkenhayn arrived. Even if the not entirely satisfactory course of July 20 at the Narew Front had already raised slight doubts in him as to whether the high hopes he had attached to the overall operation in recent days would be fulfilled, he now had to reflect that the offensive of the Mackensen Army Group was also threatening to come to a standstill due to unexpectedly stubborn resistance. If that happened, the success of the entire operation was in question. Therefore, the most urgent requirement seemed to him to keep the attack on the Narew Front in motion.

At 12:45 PM, another message from General von Falkenhayn to General Ludendorff in Lötzen arrived, stating: \"Even for the case you mentioned in yesterday's telephone conversation with Tappen, that Group Gallwitz was advancing well, unfortunately, in my opinion, no deviation from the highest orders should occur now.\"\n",
      "Then Field Marshal von Hindenburg himself addressed the Supreme Army Command at 12:45 PM: \"We also intend to break through the Narew line under all circumstances. However, since it was possible to achieve this goal without deploying the new units and their use further east would then be more effective, General Ludendorff has communicated my intention to postpone the final determination of the deployment point until the divisions begin to cross the Vistula.\" In response, General von Falkenhayn elaborated his view: Due to the situation in the Balkans, time was pressing. However, it is not to be assumed that the Mackensen Army Group, after the achievements and efforts it has already made, \"will advance quickly on its own,\" nor will the cooperation of the Woyrsch Army Detachments and the 9th Army suffice. \"So it remains only to make the Narew assault group as strong as possible, so that it quickly forces a decision, and therefore the allocation of the two fresh western divisions to it has occurred. — This does not prevent, as soon as clear signs of collapse and yielding of the enemy between the Vistula and Bug become apparent, strong forces from the Narew assault group being thrown onto the Njemen to pursue the success initiated by Your Excellency.\" The prerequisite is only \"accelerated transition of railway bodies at the East Prussian border to those over the Narew.\" They also formed, according to the view of the Eastern Commander-in-Chief(1), the precondition for unhindered progress of the Gallwitz Army Group.\n",

However, it is doubted here that the Narew operation can lead to a decision. The decision lies at Kowno, taking this fortress and advancing toward Wilna.\" It was feared, as repeatedly discussed and emphasized in the staff, \"that the Russians, with their great skill in retreat, would slip their head out of the noose at the Narew while sacrificing rear guards\"¹).\n",
      "On July 22, Field Marshal von Hindenburg presented his intentions to the Supreme Army Command: \"According to His Majesty's orders, I am placing the greatest emphasis on operations against the Narew. Since the Narew has not yet been crossed, the new infantry divisions are being unloaded at Puppen and Kolno to strengthen the Narew assault group. After crossing the Narew, Gallwitz's right wing will take the fortifications at Zegrze with the weakest possible forces, encircle Nowogeorgiewsk from the north and northeast and attack it. The 9th Army is to break through the Russian position in front of Warsaw, then cross the Vistula upstream with parts of its forces and attack Warsaw. Close cooperation between the 9th Army and Gallwitz's right wing is essential in the battle for Warsaw and Nowogeorgiewsk and will be kept in mind by me, as well as freeing up parts of the 9th Army for the offensive to the east.

After crossing the river, it was to take a more easterly direction. Depending on the need, one could then force the Bug crossing with the right wing in the area of Wyszkow and thus go directly into the rear of the Russians still holding at Warsaw, or also — remaining on the right bank of the Bug — strike towards Brest Litowsk and thus against the depth of the Russian connections. A corresponding order was already given at noon to the Gallwitz Army Group and the 8th Army after the first reports of successes achieved at Pultusk1).\n",
      "The decision of the Supreme Army Command received the following day, July 24, coincided — as far as the continuation of the Narew operation was concerned — with what the Commander-in-Chief East had already ordered. It stated: \"After taking note of Your Excellency's intentions, His Majesty has ordered: The rapid continuation of the operations of the Narew strike group in a generally southeastern direction is necessary. The more it succeeds in placing emphasis on the left wing, the better it will be. The unloadings at Kolno and Puppen already indicate this. The measures against the fortresses of Warsaw, Nowogeorgiewsk, and Zegrze are to be adapted to the guiding idea, therefore, for the time being, as few forces as possible are to be deployed against them. The capture of the fortresses is currently of no value compared to the importance of the thrust to the southeast. — Your Excellency's intention to deploy parts of the 9th Army after breaking through the position at Blonie—Nadarzyn across the Vistula corresponds to the plans of the Supreme Army Command. A reinforcement of the 10th Army is unfortunately not feasible at the moment, which also answers the final sentence of the telegram. It will be of great importance for the overall operations if the Niemen Army soon advances with at least stronger cavalry against the Russian rear connections in the area of Wilna.\"\n",

Since the battle for the Narew crossings was still in full swing when this order was received, General von Gallwitz initially gave only the Plüskow Corps the new directive to take the direction towards Wyszkow after capturing Pultusk.

North of the exploited Pultusk breach, which was essentially dry at the time, the XVII Army Corps reached up to the 36th Infantry Division on the left bank of the Narew up to the height of the Ostrołł loop. The 35th Infantry Division succeeded in bridging the river bend itself at two points, but then it was stuck in narrow bridgeheads due to increasing enemy resistance. The same happened to the Watter Corps, which, in view of strong Russian defenses at Rozan, was only able to bring weak infantry across the river. The Eben Corps also failed to advance. Although its 83rd Infantry Division under Lieutenant General Stumpff had brought two battalions across the Narew further north at Raminow, the 2nd Infantry Division, Lieutenant General von Falk, these weak forces, which had waded through the river, were only able to hold out against repeated Russian attacks with heavy losses and with extreme difficulty; flanking fire from well-fortified positions hindered their reinforcement as well as their supply with ammunition and provisions.\n",
      "The advance of the left wing of the army was particularly close to the heart of the commander-in-chief. If this success remained unachieved, while the right wing gained ground, it would result in a pivot that would increasingly lead to purely frontal pursuit behind the gradually eastward-yielding enemy; operational impact could then hardly be hoped for.</body>\n",

In the afternoon, General von Gallwitz inquired extensively by telephone with General von Eben about the prospects of crossing the river north of Rozan and considered attempting it now more at Ostrolenka, as General von Eben had originally intended1); but here too the enemy had meanwhile strengthened, and a new attempt at this point required such extensive regrouping of troops and ammunition that it could only be undertaken for July 27. However, this seemed too late. Thus, General von Gallwitz agreed to the proposal of General von Eben, who — although unable to guarantee the outcome — in agreement with Lieutenant General von Falk commanding at Kaminotka, hoped that there, even in tough fighting, they would gradually reach the goal. \"We must absolutely get through,\" it says in the record made at the Gallwitz High Command about this conversation, \"it is of utmost importance for the operation.\"\n",
      "In the mistaken assumption that General von Eben would now cross at Ostrolenka, the 8th Army was ready to join this advance with its own right wing.\n",
      "By the morning of July 25, seven Narew bridges were completed by the Gallwitz Army Group in the Pultusk—Rozan area, with another begun kilometers south of Pultusk and at Rozan. However, the enemy had meanwhile had time to settle again and further strengthen. On the front from Nowogeorgiewsk to Lomza, including both places, up to 17 Russian divisions2) now seemed to be standing, most densely just in front of the part of the German front where the Narew had already been crossed. At the same time, new delays in supply, especially in the delivery of ammunition, became noticeable; the routes from rail and field railway junctions had become longer, the few existing roads were completely worn out and often impassable due to heavy traffic and new rain showers. Thus, a shortage of ammunition arose at the fighting front, which hindered the rapid continuation of the operation even more, as the demands of the infantry for strong artillery preparation grew.</body>\n",

      "General von Gallwitz had transferred the leadership of the attack between the Narew south of Pultusk and the Pultwy-Bruch to General von Plüskow. The day passed here with skirmishes against the new Russian positions and other attack preparations. North of the Pultwy-Bruch, the XVII Army Corps advanced towards the railway running along the eastern edge of the lowland Wyszkow-Ostrolenka, where the enemy had apparently made a strong front again. At the Watter Corps, the bridges of Rozan were still under Russian fire. The infantry settled in the foreland of the Narew lowland, and the entire artillery then withdrew to the west bank in the evening. \"For the divisions of the corps, it was initially about setting up the captured positions,\" it says in the corps' war diary on this day. The Eben Corps also failed to achieve any further success. The situation of the troops, heroically established east of the river but also reinforced by battalions, became increasingly difficult, as despite all efforts, it was not possible to silence the Russian artillery machine gun fire; it came from forest positions that could not be scouted and therefore could not be fought down with limited ammunition. Thus, the losses at this one spot rose to almost 1000 men. An additional difficulty was that the water depths of the fords changed so much due to the impact of heavy Russian shells and rain that almost every connection to the east bank was eventually interrupted.\n",
      "In the 8th Army, the 75th Reserve Division succeeded in bringing a company across the river east of the Szkwa estuary; further progress was also prevented here by strong enemy counteraction.\n",
      "The hope that after overcoming the Narew near and east of Pultusk, it would proceed quickly and thus facilitate the crossing further upstream did not seem to be fulfilled.

The bridgehead on the eastern bank of the Narew at Rozan had thus been expanded in three days of fighting to a depth of only about three kilometers, though also extending northward. This — it was hoped — would benefit the 2nd Infantry Division at Kamionka, which was still fighting under the most difficult conditions for the crossing. Despite serious losses, Lieutenant General von Falk did not want to give up here, but continued to reinforce the units that had crossed, although they gained no significant ground forward.\n",
      "At Ostrolenka, new delays occurred. General von Gallwitz, who placed particular value on rapid forward progress at this point and therefore pressed for it, had to yield to the objections of General von Eben, who wanted to execute the crossing only after thorough preparation, based on the experiences at Kamionka. Major General Baron von Watter, the commander of the approaching 54th Infantry Division, reported that despite all efforts to accelerate, he could not cross until the 28th. This was partly due to the unfamiliar road conditions in the East, which posed great difficulties for his vehicles coming from the West, further increased by rainfall.\n",
      "The 8th Army also achieved barely any progress on July 26th. Two battalions of the 75th Reserve Division reached the left bank of the Narew; however, their situation threatened to become difficult when the enemy prevented bridge construction here as well through artillery fire and searchlight illumination.\n",
      "In a situation report directly requested by the Supreme Army Command in the morning, General von Gallwitz had reported on his current mission and described his forces as sufficient against the enemy forces currently opposing him. However, for an effective continuation of the attack, the troops needed a rest period and, above all, ammunition. Further delays in the forward movement were therefore inevitable. General von Gallwitz contemplated the idea of first directing all force to the left wing, with which he then wanted to swing southward.

General von Plüskow considered a withdrawal of units that had suffered particularly heavy losses only possible \"once a rear position had been established\". On the left wing at Rozan, where the enemy had evacuated the wooded area east of the river during the night, the bridgehead was expanded to Goworowo, reaching a depth of eleven kilometers; simultaneously, the 83rd Infantry Division could advance northward to within about five kilometers of the Kamionka crossing point; in total, more than 2000 prisoners were captured. However, the hoped-for relief for the situation of the 2nd Infantry Division remained elusive for now. The 54th Infantry Division, positioned for crossing at Ostrolenka, still lacked the promised pontoons and some ammunition, so that the river crossing early on July 28th seemed impossible according to the unit commanders. General von Eben, however, maintained the previously set attack time.\n",
      "In the 8th Army, the 75th Reserve Division under Lieutenant General von Seydewitz had succeeded in completing a bridge at the Szkwa mouth during the night and, during the course of the day, bringing its entire infantry to the southern bank of the Narew despite enemy fire; the 58th Infantry Division had arrived behind it. Lieutenant General Ludendorff now designated the advance eastward against the rear of Lomza as the next task for this wing of the 8th Army; he promised two mortar batteries from the Eben Corps once this corps had completed its crossing. Since the heavy batteries freed up at Pultusk and Rozan had been assigned to the Beseler Group, the left wing of Army Group Gallwitz and the right wing of the 8th Army had to make do with their existing artillery, which was quite insufficient for the task at hand; the Eben Corps had only six heavy howitzer batteries for its three infantry divisions.\n",
      "On the morning of July 28th, Army Group Gallwitz reported directly to the Supreme Army Command, apparently in response to their inquiry: On the right wing, the attack against Dembe—Serock would be possible in about three days; \"until then, the Russians are exhausting themselves in futile attacks\". The Prut position, which had proved to be strongly fortified, was also to be attacked; however, it would take two to three days before the ammunition would arrive. At the Pulwy marsh and to the north, the XVII Army Corps would fight a delaying action across a broad front. The important thing now was to first help the Eben Corps cross the Narew. If the crossing at Ostrolenka succeeded today or tomorrow, the offensive could be continued on this wing as well in two to three days with nine divisions.</body>\n",

While Colonel Marquard pointed out that \"the encirclement around Warsaw must be closed and tightened,\" the left wing should not be extended further against the 8th Army, rather it should be reinforced if possible, Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmann represented the view of the Commander-in-Chief East, who did not expect much from the thrust southwards against and over the Bug, but wished to gain space southwards; the Gallwitz Army Group should first unite with the 8th Army to open the Narew crossing in the direction of Sniadowo; until Lomza had fallen, it could not cross the Bug anyway.\n",
      "Reports of Russian offensive activity also came from the right wing of the Army Group on this day. In a discussion with the Plüskow Corps, Colonel Marquard hoped that the Russians would bleed out in the continuous attacks. Meanwhile, the German attack was halted everywhere. The resumption at the Plüskow Corps was now scheduled for August 3; until then, ammunition should be procured. This meant that the right wing of the army was not only — as assumed in the morning report to the Supreme Army Command — delayed for three days, but for almost a week, the advance against the Bug directly into the rear of Warsaw, to close the encirclement there, was postponed accordingly. But even on the rest of the front, things did not go as desired on July 28.\n",
      "At the Watter Corps, only a local success at Goworowo was recorded; the temporarily assigned 83rd Infantry Division, reserve, landwehr, and landsturm troops with only about six batteries, were too weak to make further progress after the successes of the previous day. At the Eben Corps, the stubbornly enduring 2nd Infantry Division managed to bring five batteries across the river during the night — parts of the 37th Infantry Division followed —, but the situation could not be decisively improved initially.\n",
      "At Ostrolenka, where the security detachment of the 54th Infantry Division only partially succeeded early in the morning against the enemy's prepared defense, the army command, considering the experiences at Ramonieka, considered whether to proceed with the operation after all to abort the operation after all, in order to bring the division over a bridge that had meanwhile been started south of Kamionta to the left bank of the Narew.\n",

In contrast, the division commander, Major General von Watter, still considered the execution of the already initiated operation promising and necessary \"in the interest of the troops and the cause.\" He wanted to conduct crossings at several points during the coming night, thus on a broader front, with which General von Eben also agreed. However, General von Gallwitz now intervened with the order to prepare the division for a march southward, where a secured crossing was guaranteed and fresh fighting power was urgently needed against the enemy's tenacious resistance.\n",
      "With the 8th Army, the 75th Reserve Division could not significantly expand its position south of the Narew due to rising water; its troops were, as stated in the war diary, \"at the end of their strength after enormous exertions.\" For the continuation of the attack, the 58th Infantry Division was also placed under the command of Lieutenant General von Seydewitz and deployed on the right wing.\n",
      "The morning of July 29 brought the surprising news that the Army Detachment Woyrsch had gained the right bank of the Vistula between Iwangorod and Warsaw with several spearheads¹). However, complete standstill prevailed at their own front; the enemy seemed to be reinforcing here; near Wyskow, aviators had reported unloading of troops that appeared to be marching toward Ostrow. If the enemy withdrew from the Vistula, it was possible that he would try to gain room for maneuver to the north. General von Gallwitz therefore ordered for his entire right wing up to and including the XVII Army Corps to strengthen and wire their positions and to withdraw reserves. On the left army wing, on July 30, unless a \"significant change in the situation occurred\" by then, only the Eben Corps was to attack, to which the 83rd Infantry Division fell back. The objective was to envelop the IV Siberian Corps stationed at Ostrolenka from the south. The Watter Corps was to cover the right flank of this attack. As General von Gallwitz explained to General Ludendorff²), his further intention remained unchanged: \"Hold on the right, no attack against the fortresses for now. On the left with ten divisions, covered against the east by the 8th Army, advance on Ostrow—Malkin,\" thus executing a large right wheel against the Bug. From the Plüskow Corps, the 1st Guard Reserve Division was to march back to Szelkow as an army reserve, from where it could be drawn over Rozan to reinforce the left army wing.</body>\n",

      "The attack of the Eben Corps didn't begin until noon on July 30th and, despite the deployment of the 54th Infantry Division on the right wing, its results again fell far short of the hopes of the Gallwitz High Command. Due to the Russians' tenacious resistance, instead of encirclement, they only achieved a frontal push-back of a few kilometers in a northeastern direction. A directive that General von Gallwitz gave to the Commanding Generals and Division Commanders on this day shows what general difficulties stood in the way of rapid advance, but also with what emphasis the leadership nevertheless held fast to achieving a great objective through attack. It stated: \"The great successes achieved in the fight for strongly fortified positions through the deployment of heavy and heaviest artillery must not lead to waiting for the cooperation of such combat resources even in cases where the fight can be carried out without them.\" The 21 cm mortars were intended for strongly fortified strongpoints, against wide wire obstacles, and under certain circumstances also against localities with strong masonry. However, the ammunition resupply was difficult and, with lengthening supply lines, could only be accomplished at the expense of field artillery ammunition and provisions. As much as it was necessary to \"spare the infantry losses where possible, we must also not spoil the troops too much. Hastily constructed strongpoints, for whose construction the enemy had only a few days available, must be overcome with the cooperation of field artillery and heavy field howitzers. The longer the attack on such points is delayed, the more time the enemy has to strengthen them.\"\n",
      "Ammunition shortage also became apparent in the 8th Army. The commander of the 58th Infantry Division, Lieutenant General von Gersdorff, who was accustomed to western combat conditions, reported that in his opinion \"a continuation of the attack was impossible with the completely inadequate means.\" The Narew crossing was not anticipated until the night of August 2nd.\n",
      "For a week, the operation had essentially been at a standstill. General von Gallwitz brought the 1st Guard Reserve Division to his left wing. When he then also withdrew the 50th Reserve Division from the Plüskow Group on July 31st, this group felt capable only of holding the position, but no longer of attacking. On the same day, at the Eben Corps, a Russian counterattack temporarily broke through the 83rd Infantry Division and inflicted heavy losses on it.</body>\n",

      "<body>The division inflicted heavy losses on them. At the same time, it became apparent that the situation of the parts that had crossed the Narew at Kamionka was significantly worse than General von Gallwitz had assumed based on previous reports. General von Eben had indeed ordered the continuation of the attack on the entire front east of the Narew, but had to report in the evening that his ammunition columns at the distribution point Krempa, where the Watter Corps also received supplies, would have to wait for days to be filled; the demands of his corps were barely met to a third there, which posed a serious threat to the continuation of the attack. Nevertheless, progress was made by the 2nd Infantry Division during the afternoon, especially in finally taking the Russian position dominating the crossing at Point 92. At Ostrolenka, rearward movements of the enemy were observed on the southern bank of the Narew. On the other hand, the Narew Bridge of the 75th Reserve Division was destroyed again by Russian fire at the 8th Army. At 11 p.m., General von Eben ordered the continuation of the attack on the entire front for the following day to open the river crossing for the 8th Army.\n",
      "Even August 1st brought no decisive progress. Complaints about ammunition shortages persisted, while the Russian artillery showed more activity than before. According to Major General Tappen of the Supreme Army Command, who spoke at the German headquarters in Krazne that day, there was enough ammunition available for the East; however, due to long and poor road connections from the unloading stations, it did not reach the front in the required amount. Not only the Chief of Staff of the Eben Corps, Major General von Boyna, but also that of the Watter Corps, Lieutenant Colonel Reinhardt, made emphatic complaints about this situation in telephone conversations with the High Command. The cholera threat was also not yet overcome¹). There were 97 cases; as a specialist in combating it, General Physician Dr. Hünermann joined the army group.\n",
      "Meanwhile, it became known that the attack of Army Group Mackensen was now progressing and that one of the works of Iwangorod had already fallen. Foreign newspapers spoke of the impending evacuation of Warsaw.

      "<body>On August 2, pilots reported that the evacuation of Warsaw seemed to be well advanced; numerous larger bivouacs had been observed south of the Bug towards Nowo Minsk. Increasingly, it had to be considered that the enemy was now also yielding in front of the Army Group Gallwitz. However, on this day, only the Eben Corps made some progress; on August 3, it found the Russian positions at the Narew near Ostrolenka vacated and moved forward. By evening, the railway from Goworowo to south of Ostrolenka had been reached; more than 2000 prisoners were taken. \"The railway for the general attack in a southeasterly direction was clear,\" wrote General von Gallwitz later; it was to begin on August 4. Instead, the Commander-in-Chief East now ordered the continuation of the attack with the left wing on Sniadowo, thus sharply to the east. This required a turn from the previously southeast-directed front and the final abandonment of the thrust south over the Bug into the rear of Warsaw. Somewhat deviating from the decision of the Commander-in-Chief East, General von Gallwitz temporarily held on to the idea of advancing his left wing more southeasterly to cooperate with the Mackensen Army Group.\n",
      "On August 4, the attack was also resumed at the Watter Corps, which had meanwhile been reinforced by the 1st Guard Reserve Division, and the enemy east of Goworowo, on and north of the road to Ostroln, was thrown out of its positions in fierce fighting. At the same time, the Eben Corps advanced up to 15 kilometers east of Ostrolenka. Following this, the \"Seydewitz Corps\" (58th Infantry and 75th Reserve Division) of the 8th Army began the advance south of the Narew to the east. Near the town of Nowogrod, the 10th Landwehr Division crossed the river. 5000 prisoners were the day's bounty for the Gallwitz Army Group, 4000 of them at the Watter Corps. However, the territorial gain for this corps, especially on its right wing, remained small. In the evening, it was also learned that the enemy of the 9th Army had meanwhile retreated behind the fortifications of Warsaw and that it had completely vacated the left Vistula bank at Iwangorod. One particularly felt \"a decision,\" noted General von Gallwitz on this day. However, he still expected new resistance from the enemy in a position that had meanwhile been prepared, which ran fairly straight from the northeastern end of the Pulwy Marsh to the area west of Lomza.</body>\n",

      "On August 6th, the left wing of the Beseler group reached the fort Dembe on the Narew, which was not defended by the enemy. Otherwise, the day brought some progress in tough fighting in the direction of the southwest, especially at Wonsowo and Czerwín, which, although not operationally significant, together with the battles of the last three days, resulted in a larger number of prisoners, 14,000 men along with 69 machine guns, and also a capture of six guns. An attempt made by the 8th Army on this day to advance against Dostwiec by releasing gas, however, did not achieve the hoped-for success. On the other hand, various points on the front reported backward movements by the enemy; numerous village fires indicated imminent, perhaps larger, retreat intentions of the Russians.\n",

However, if the Russians retreated here, it was to follow them to encircle Warsaw and Nowogeorgiewsk on the left bank of the Vistula.\n",
      "After the transfer of the XVII and ½ XI Army Corps for the Narew attack, Field Marshal Leopold Prince of Bavaria, with Major General Grünert as Chief of Staff, at his nearly 100-kilometer-long front still had over 6½ infantry divisions, including the fully capable assault troops of the 5th, 49th, and 50th Reserve Divisions, as well as a cavalry division¹).\n",

The Supreme Command estimated the force ratio against the opposing Russian 2nd Army at 83 German versus 148 Russian battalions, though they felt significantly superior in artillery of all calibers and ammunition. As aerial reconnaissance results repeatedly indicated that the enemy would soon withdraw to the Grojec-Blonie position, the pursuit concept took precedence over the defensive task. Both the Supreme Army Command and the Supreme Commander East wished that the enemy, before withdrawing, should be further weakened by another gas attack if possible, to relieve pressure on both Army Group Mackensen's offensive and the impending attack against the Narew.\n",
      "On July 6th, Field Marshal Prince Leopold ordered gas to be released as soon as weather conditions permitted. The priority was \"to damage the enemy before it's too late, even if full tactical exploitation of the effects must be foregone.\" Gas cylinders were installed in the area of the XXV Reserve Corps between Humin and the Sucha, and in the northern adjacent Bzura bend near Beseler's group. The timing of the release was left to the commanding generals.\n",
      "Already that evening, weather conditions in the southern sector seemed so favorable that General von Scheffer ordered the release at 9:45. Between Humin and Borzynow, the success appeared good. Further north, the release was suspended due to insufficient wind strength, but then the gas cloud that had formed further south blew back there and drifted northward along the positions beyond the Sucha. It came completely unexpectedly for the German troops stationed there and wasn't even recognized in the darkness. Serious losses occurred; against a total loss of only 29 men from Russian fire stood about 1450 casualties from their own gas, including 138 dead - counting all who died from the effects in the following days. The effect on the enemy also appears to have been considerable.

      "In the following days, signs of the enemy's impending retreat increased. The Russian IV Corps had been withdrawn from the front on the right wing of the army, and the enemy weakened in front of the southern adjoining Army Detachment Woyrsch. Daily, the pilots reported heavy rail traffic in the rear area. Prisoners stated that the area in front of the Blonie position was being devastated, and villages there were being burned down.

      "When the attack at Przasnysz began on July 13, the tension increased, but the 9th Army itself was further weakened. It had already given up the 50th Reserve Division; Landsturm troops and re-harnessed artillery had taken their place and were consolidated into a division under Major General Gerée. When the attack by the Gallwitz Army Group made good progress and on the right wing, which had remained calm opposite the 9th Army, began to move on the Vistula bank, the Commander-in-Chief East announced on July 16 that the 9th Army was to prepare for the siege of Warsaw and Nowogeorgiewsk; moreover, further forces were to be released in the event of a Russian retreat. The 83rd Infantry Division and the Menges Division were designated for this purpose.\n",

A little over 1300 prisoners were the total spoils.

The Supreme Commander East gave the order to break through the enemy positions between Grojec and Blonie in the direction of Tarczyn, \"to gain the right bank of the Vistula above Warsaw³) and attack Warsaw.\" He made ammunition particularly available. On the left, the army was to secure against Nowogeorgiewsk, for its later siege General von Beseler transferred to the General Command of the III Reserve Corps to the Army Group Gallwitz⁴), while Lieutenant General von Diringshofen took command of the troops of the left wing of the army.\n",
      "Already on the morning of July 21, the expectation of the High Command 9 was confirmed. The enemy had evacuated the Grojec position at night, but still held at Blonie. The corps Scheffer (49th Reserve Division and Landsturm Division Gereke), previously set for the breakthrough to Tarczyn, was given the direction to the northeast towards Piaseczno. On July 22, the 9th Cavalry Division, as the right wing of the army, following the enemy, reached the Vistula over the Pilica estuary and turned north against Gora Kalwarja. The new Russian position extended in a semicircle of about ten kilometers around this place and then moved to the Warsaw front, which ran from Piaseczno via Nadarzyn and Blonie to the Vistula west of Nowogeorgiewsk.\n",
      "On this day, the Supreme Army Command had announced that, according to reliable reports, the evacuation of Warsaw was to be expected soon, so as not to expose it to shelling. To the left of the Vistula, the extensive fortifications of the city, as aerial reconnaissance showed, had already been blown up by the enemy. The Supreme Army Command placed great importance on accelerating the attack on the fortress front. The 9th Army planned for July 25. Field Marshal Prince Leopold led the breakthrough against the Piaseczno—Nadarzyn section, with the aim of reaching Warsaw early here. The following days were spent preparing for the attack, especially with the positioning of the partly unlimbered batteries and their ammunition; air raids were launched against the Warsaw station and the Vistula bridges. As then on July 24, the news of the capture of the Narew fortresses Pultusk and Rozan came, it seemed to the Supreme Army Command and the Supreme Commander East that it was high time to also advance with special emphasis from the west against the Russians.</body>\n",

      "On July 27, Generaloberst von Woyrsch informed the Commander-in-Chief East that his left wing, the German Landwehr Corps, was to force the Vistula crossing between Iwangorod and Gora Kalwarja, at the mouth of the Radomka, on the night of July 29. For this, he requested the support of the 9th Army through feigned operations below the mouth of the Pilica. However, the enemy pushed back the German 9th Cavalry Division, which was standing in a 22-kilometer-wide front, somewhat during these days. The wide deployment of the army was not considered entirely without concern, as it had concentrated all its strength in a narrow space against the planned breakthrough point and was no longer so mobile due to its entire composition with built-in, partly unmanned guns and numerous siege and bridge equipment, that it could evade at any time. At the same time, it became apparent that the amount of ammunition necessary for the destruction of the Russian position and for subsequent new attack preparations would probably not be available at all. Rather, the Supreme Army Command had pointed out that, according to the evening report from the previous day, there seemed to be little prospect of early successes against the Blonie position; in this case, a reinforcement of the Narew strike group or the Woyrsch army detachment by parts of the 9th Army would be considered, \"all the more so as, according to all reports, the Russians will hardly hold Warsaw if it is threatened from the east.\"\n",
      "The Commander-in-Chief East replied: The Russians had about six divisions in the Blonie position and were conducting the defense very actively. Therefore, a further weakening of the 9th Army would be impossible, even if the attack were stopped. In view of the current high water level of the Vistula and the Russian fortifications along the eastern bank, the attempt to cross at the mouth of the Radomka seemed to him to have little prospect of success. \"Within the framework of the current operations, it would therefore be more promising to either reinforce the 9th Army with the Landwehr Corps to initially push the Russians into Warsaw, where they would have strong forces free to deploy — or to deploy the Landwehr Corps on the right wing of the Narew strike group to accelerate the fall of Warsaw through vigorous pressure from the north.\" General von Falkenhayn replied: \"Although I do not consider an advance of the Russians from the Blonie position westward with further objectives likely, the release of forces from the 9th Army is temporarily refrained from in consideration of Your Excellency's position.\"</body>\n",

General von Falkenhayn now points out that the Eastern Commander-in-Chief had based his assessment of the difficulties of these two army parts on incorrect assumptions. The favorable turn on the southern part of the Polish theater of war had also revived his hope of achieving a great success on the chosen path.

The letter, in which he informed the Eastern Commander-in-Chief of the decision, for the first time also contained a certain concession to the operational idea that he had been advocating with increasing emphasis since the meeting in Posen on July 2. General von Falkenhayn admitted that it was undoubtedly highly desirable to advance with a strong army on the middle Njemen, but then continued: \"Time and space unfortunately make it impossible to form this army from contributions from Woyrsch around Mackensen so that the enemy could not easily take timely countermeasures.

This line of thought also corresponded to the intention to give further impact to the successful, but not yet secured, crossing of the Vistula by the Woyrsch Army Detachment by providing reinforcements. On July 31, the inquiry was therefore made to the Commander-in-Chief East: \"The crossing of the Vistula by the Landwehr Corps has already led to a welcome impact on the enemy. The effect would be significantly increased by bringing in additional forces. An attempt will be made to make troops from the southeastern front available for these purposes. Support could be provided more quickly by the 9th Army.

He believes that we lack the forces for the big pincer. He still wants to bring the III Army Corps from the west to Gallwitz, where everything available must be deployed. The mistake is that we do not aim with Falkenhayn to destroy the Russian army as much as possible. They want to be content with the defense on the Bug line, to then bring their ten corps through a breakthrough to the west. Falkenhayn does not come to this thought. He believes that we fulfill the task with the army, bringing about the decision in the east through our own operation against the rear connections of the Russians. For this purpose, everything possible from the Bug Army to Gallwitz should be pulled out for the offensive.

Their slow progress1) threatened to nullify this hope at the beginning of August. He therefore considered further reinforcement of this group necessary and suggested to the Eastern Commander-in-Chief on August 2 whether the transfer of one to two divisions of the 9th Army to the Narew was now appropriate. \"Even if the Russians wanted to leave the right and advance westward from the fortress triangle, which I consider very unlikely, they will not be able to change the course of the main decision in any way. The position of the Commander-in-Chief of the 9th Army would indeed be temporarily very impaired. However, I am ready to request an order from His Majesty that would remove any sharpness from the process.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Eastern Commander-in-Chief had already decided to reinforce the 10th Army with new forces as preparation for the future attack against Kowno2). He replied to the Supreme Army Command on August 3: \"I do not currently consider it possible to withdraw one to two divisions from the entire front, which is under attack and in close contact with the enemy parts of the 9th Army. If the Russians vacate the Blonie position, one to two divisions will be freed. I will prepare everything to expedite the transport. However, I do not consider their deployment at the Narew favorable. There is no lack of troops here, but we are fighting purely frontally in very difficult terrain conditions. I can only support the deployment of forces that may be freed up at the 9th Army at Kowno, to decisively act against the rear connections of the Russians in conjunction with the Njemen Army after capturing the fortress. Kowno maintains only weak fire. A quick deployment is still possible here. However, I will also attack Kowno without reinforcing my weak left flank to prepare an offensive here. I have given the order for this. I request the allocation of ammunition for the heaviest artillery and heavy field howitzer ammunition. Should I receive the heaviest artillery, I would be grateful.\" In response to a query from General von Falkenhayn, this position was supplemented: \"Before the 9th Army, the enemy apparently about to vacate the Blonie position.\"\n",

      "That the Supreme Army Command considered such plans had been known to the Commander-in-Chief East for some time, yet the order came now as a complete surprise. After a series of incomparable victories and almost a year of successful activity as the sole commander over the German part of the Eastern Front, Field Marshal von Hindenburg felt the restriction of his command area, ordered on the very day of the capture of the Polish capital, as an affront. His staff felt the same way. This exacerbated the opposition to the Supreme Army Command to the utmost, in conjunction with factual disagreements, leading to an irritated exchange of telegrams with them. That General von Falkenhayn expressly described the formation of the new army group as a temporary, purely operational measure necessitated by the war situation and the command arrangement vis-à-vis the Austro-Hungarian army, which did not restrict the administrative area of the Commander-in-Chief East, could not erase the feeling that, besides factual reasons, at least the intention played a role to limit the power area of the Commander-in-Chief East and thereby take away the possibility of reinforcing the 10th Army and thus the planned thrust over the Njemen.\n",
      "Despite the reorganization of circumstances, the Commander-in-Chief East adhered to the plan to dispatch the parts of the 9th Army (84th Infantry Division and heavy batteries) already designated against Kowno, but encountered decisive rejection from the Supreme Army Command. General von Falkenhayn expressed his conviction again on August 6, \"that in the current situation, everything depends on defeating the enemy in Poland by attacking from all sides, and that rapid advancement of the wings is only possible if a strong pressure from the Vistula is exerted.\" For use against Kowno, he proposed the 115th Infantry Division from the West as a replacement for the requested parts of the 9th Army, which, however, could only arrive on August 12. The heavy batteries were to be released only after the 9th Army had forced the Vistula crossing, thus at a quite uncertain time. From the troops of this army, the Commander-in-Chief East was left only with the division-strengthened, consisting of Landwehr and Landsturm, previous Westernhagen detachment, which had formed the northern wing and was designated against the southern front of Nowogeorgiewsk.</body>\n",

      "The entirety of these events prompted a letter from Field Marshal von Hindenburg to General von Falkenhayn, in which he bitterly complained on August 12 that \"the degree of independence essential for his position, naturally serving the whole, had gradually and repeatedly been restricted in a rather diminishing form to an extent that not only impaired his creativity but also significantly hampered the conduct of operations.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Njemen Army had reached Poniewiez and Mitau, and the 10th Army had initiated the attack against the large Njemen fortress Kowno. Despite the extremely limited means available according to the previous instructions of the Supreme Army Command, the Eastern Commander-in-Chief was determined to continue doing everything possible to gain ground in the Njemen area and thereby pave the way for a future operation over Wilna. However, it was difficult to muster the necessary forces after the transfer of the 9th Army, as not only Kowno but also the large fortress Nowogeorgiewsk had to be dealt with, in front of which about four divisions were entrenched. On August 7, General von Falkenhayn had pointed out: \"Our ammunition situation makes it completely impossible to simultaneously undertake the siege of two fortresses\"; since the siege of Kowno had already been initiated, that of Nowogeorgiewsk had to be postponed. But just two days later, he demanded that the deployment of the heaviest Austrian-Hungarian batteries, freed up from Iwangorod, be directed first against Nowogeorgiewsk, whose accelerated capture he \"must place special value on given the current situation and the reports on the condition of the garrison.\" Thus, in the following days, the attack on Kowno and that on Nowogeorgiewsk proceeded side by side.\n",
      "Once again, Field Marshal von Hindenburg reported his assessment of the overall situation to the Supreme Army Command on the morning of August 13: \"The operation in the East, despite excellent achievements of the Narew thrust, has not led to the destruction of the enemy. The Russian has, as expected, evaded the pincer movement and allows himself to be pushed back frontally in the direction he desires.</body>\n",

On the other hand, a decisive blow is only possible from the area around Kowno, although unfortunately a considerable amount of time has been lost for this. I therefore urgently request again a reinforcement of my left wing, in order to either become offensive depending on their outcome or at least to hold the territory gained so far. I emphasize again that I saw the only possibility of destroying the enemy in the offensive of my left wing against connections and the rear of the enemy. This offensive is probably still the only means to avoid a new campaign, in case it is not already too late for this.\"\n",
      "In contrast, General von Falkenhayn stated in his detailed response of August 14: \"The destruction of the enemy has never been hoped for from the ongoing operations in the East, but merely a decisive victory corresponding to the purposes of the Supreme Army Command. The destruction as a whole should not have been pursued in the present case, according to my view, which must remain decisive after approval by His Majesty. The basic conditions for this are simply lacking, one cannot expose the connections of an opponent who is numerically far superior and facing frontally, who has excellent connections, unlimited time, and unrestricted space, while one is forced to operate in trackless, path-poor terrain with a tight time limit and in connection with many troops that are not very powerful, some even not resistant. However, no one will doubt that the enemy has already been decisively defeated for our purposes, who realizes that the Russians have lost about 750,000 men as prisoners alone in three months, countless material, besides Galicia the Kingdom of Poland and the Duchy of Courland, finally the possibility of seriously threatening Austria-Hungary during the initiation of the Italian war or at all in the foreseeable future, as well as the other, their Odessa army, at the critical moment in the Balkans. There is also some prospect that the results of the operations will increase, as it has been possible to push no less than five thoroughly defeated enemy armies into the area between Bialystok and Brest Litowsk.\" — In contrast, the Chief of the General Staff now admitted for the first time that the operation would probably have been even more decisive if it had been possible to simultaneously strike over the Niemen.</body>\n",

      "On August 24, General von Falkenhayn responded to the complaints of the Field Marshal General from August 12.3) He emphasized that none of the measures he himself proposed or ordered according to his authority had ever been carried out for reasons other than purely factual ones. In impressive sentences, he then stated: \"In my position, I have to bear the responsibility for the overall course of the war before my conscience, before our King and Lord, and before our descendants entirely alone. No one can share it with me, no one can relieve me of it, no one can help me in the slightest. In this position, subordinating my honest, factual conviction to the opinion of anyone else, no matter how high they stand, or even to personal consideration, no matter how venerable the person in question may be, would be a crime for which there is no closer designation, not because I consider myself better than many others — I know my inadequacy all too well —, but because in my office, which was not entrusted to me through my own doing or at my own request, but merely through the trust of His Majesty in the most difficult moment of the war, according to my understanding, there should be no factual compromises, and because my absolute duty in this office is to unite all parts of our armed forces in joint action for the good of the whole according to the unified will of the supreme command, which of course only represents that of His Majesty.\"\n",

Here, the 8th Army joined in the direction of the Narew lowlands west of Lomza. Again, 4000 prisoners were brought in. The enemy apparently was in an orderly retreat to the east from the previously advanced arc against the middle Vistula. The bridges over the lower Bug had been demolished, numerous localities set on fire.\n",
      "General von Gallwitz still intended to pursue in a generally southeast direction to intercept the Russian forces retreating from Warsaw to the east at the Bug.

Accordingly, the commander-in-chief P gave the 12th Army the order on August 8 to advance north of the Bug against the line Makow—Zambrow—Lomza, main forces on Czyzew. Subsequently, the 8th Army received Rutki as its target; it was to take Lomza. When General von Gallwitz again expressed hope of capturing the enemy retreating from the Vistula at the Bug, Lieutenant General Ludendorff wanted to take this possibility into account. General von Gallwitz was, however, little satisfied: \"My new front,\" he later wrote, \"left to the east, right to the south, then formed almost a right angle. Ludendorff, however, considered the army strong enough to turn sufficient forces to the southeast against Ciechanowice in addition to the front to the east and the Bug occupation in the south.

      "However, he often did not let himself be deterred in his decisions. General Ludendorff had already informed the 8th Army that it was desirable to take Lomza as soon as possible to free up forces for the 10th Army, with the 3rd Reserve Division being considered for the task. In the evening, he agreed in a conversation with Colonel Marquard that the 12th Army no longer intended to cross the Bug, and concluded by saying: \"If you want to wait a little longer, you must hold far ahead. I believe you have enough forces.\"\n",
      "The view recorded in the files, which the Chief of Staff of the 12th Army, Colonel Marquard, presented to his commander in the evening, sought to bridge the differences: \"The enemy cannot, due to poor road conditions, withdraw all the forces located there, about 16 corps, from the arc between the Vistula and the Bug over Brest Litowsk and south of it. Rather, at least five to six corps must cross the Bug northwest of the fortress, even if some corps are transported by rail. The task of the 12th Army is to prevent this retreat to the northeast or at least to hinder the enemy as much as possible. If the enemy immediately begins the backward movement, the 12th Army may no longer be able to catch him at the Bug. The operations must therefore be conducted so that in this worst case, one can fall on the enemy's flank further east — in the Bielsk area. The longer the enemy delays the withdrawal, the more likely it is to engage him in battle at the Bug. If he offers sustained resistance in a position forward of Brest, one can completely get behind him. To do justice to all these possibilities, one must pursue the now defeated enemy with a strong left wing and echeloned right along the Bug.\" Accordingly, Colonel Marquard wanted, as soon as the current resistance was broken, to direct the left wing, the Eben Corps, towards Zambrow, the Hahne Corps south past Andrzejow, the Watter Corps and the XVII Army Corps against the enemy north of Andrzejow and at the Bug, the XVII Reserve Corps folded right. \"The main idea\" must remain to encircle the enemy \"in the north and push him back over the Bug or in a southeasterly direction. Only if the execution proves impossible and a concentration of the main forces on other parts of the front becomes necessary should this viewpoint be abandoned. — If the enemy prepares in a bridgehead position at the Bug, it should be indicated: XVII Army Corps between Bug and Straße Ostrow—Malkin, Korps Watter subsequently from the north and northeast.\"\n",

When the left wing of the 8th Army's attack group had passed the Wizna swamp, it would face danger from the left, and it was questionable whether the army's strength would then be sufficient.

The enemy now seemed to be in full retreat to the east. Pilots reported retreating enemy columns in many places; villages were burning, the fields were devastated. A leap forward was achieved, as on no day since the beginning of the operation; it amounted to 20 kilometers and more for many corps. South of the Bug, contact was made south of Wyszkow with the cavalry of the 9th Army.\n",
      "General von Gallwitz and his advisors were not entirely of the same opinion regarding the further direction to be taken. Since the end of July, the First General Staff Officer, Major Stäpf, had increasingly inclined to the view of the Commander-in-Chief East that the Narew-Ostrolenka had done its part, and that the decision should henceforth be sought in the Njemen area. \"The distance we have gained in four weeks can be marched on the left wing in four days,\" he wrote on August 9. In contrast, General von Gallwitz himself still held firmly to the idea of pursuing with full force to the southwest. Colonel Marquard, however, now proposed a more northerly direction, \"since there is nothing more to be gained at the Bug.\" The decision requested by the Commander-in-Chief East was fair to both possibilities and went as follows: the army should, with the main focus on the right, push further forward against Ciechanowice–Sokolv; the 8th Army, which had entered through the Wizna swamp, would maintain connection with them. However, since this army had just now to hand over the 3rd Reserve Division, which was standing northeast of Lomza, to the 10th Army, it counted only five divisions, of which three were already south of the Narew.\n",

This was due less to the strength of the enemy than to the fatigue of the troops and the almost complete lack of visibility of the terrain. It was repeatedly expressed to the Army High Command that while the attack was progressing slowly, and the reinforcement of the lines with new masses changed nothing noteworthy, much had been achieved with some rest for the troops, who had been in continuous combat for four weeks.\" At the Corps Plüskow and Eben joining to the north, the enemy offered even considerably more resistance. Unlike the previous day, it appeared to be not weak rear guards but stronger forces with much artillery; the entire day was spent struggling to advance just a few kilometers. By evening, the Eben Corps had taken Zambrowo. The 8th Army had gained a foothold on the eastern bank of the Gac section.\n",
      "Thus the narrowest point between Bug and Narew had been reached; on a 45-kilometer front, about 18 German divisions stood so close together that it had already become necessary to place five of them in the second echelon. The Narew operation had long since passed its tactical peak and threatened to devolve operationally into frontal pursuit. Catching the Russian masses retreating before the army groups Mackensen and Prince Leopold east of the Bug could only succeed if the 12th Army advanced quickly, faster than the enemy could retreat. So far, this had not been the case. In the 30 days since July 13, they had gained about 120 kilometers in total, amounting to only four kilometers per day; it was hardly to be expected that they would advance significantly faster in the future. August 11 had again shown what it meant when the enemy was willing to offer resistance. With an enemy who had conducted his withdrawal operation skillfully up to this point, such determination had to be expected to continue whenever his situation required it.\n",
      "The battles so far had clearly shown the difficulties of frontal pursuit. Actual pursuit had rarely occurred: Almost everywhere and every time, the enemy had been able to withdraw unnoticed under the cover of darkness after stubborn resistance, only to establish new positions further back, often in previously prepared positions. Each time, weak points in the new formation had to be scouted, the attack ordered, and the artillery concentrated on the breakthrough points. Every tactical advance had to be purchased with an expenditure of time, ammunition, and blood that hardly corresponded to the operational gain.</body>\n",

      "The unexpectedly large ammunition requirement, even for an experienced artillery general like the commander-in-chief of the 12th Army, which had to be used to overcome every single enemy rearguard position¹), significantly contributed to the delay of the advance. The increasing distance from the starting point made it increasingly difficult to bring up the necessary quantities. The railway construction could not keep pace with the operation despite its slowness. At the destroyed Vistula bridge in Warsaw, on the Mlava–Nowogeorgiewsk line, otherwise on German territory and near Kolno, the endpoints of the main railway operations were temporarily located. A field railway rebuilt from Mlava via Przasnysz had reached the area west of Rozan, coming from Willenberg to Ostrolenka, thus ending about 60 kilometers behind the front. The troops to be pursued between Bug and Narew had meanwhile grown to about 18 divisions with more than 700 guns.\n",
      "Opposite them, however, the enemy had also further strengthened. By August 11, about 18 divisions of his 1st and 12th Army were standing, of which four divisions were gradually brought in from the Southwestern Front, with probably also about 700 guns²). Thus, the impression of the German troops seems correct that the enemy was now considerably stronger in artillery than at the beginning of the operation. The more his infantry dwindled, the more the essentially undiminished artillery had to make itself felt.\n",
      "The severity, but also the peculiarity of the four-week previous battles is illustrated by the following figures: The casualties of the Gallwitz Army and the right wing of the 8th Army involved in the attack had grown from about 37,000 between July 13 and 26 to more than 56,000 by August 8.</body>\n",

General von Falkenhayn wanted to decisively hit the retreating enemy still west of the Rokitno swamps and the primeval forest of Bialowieza. The army group Prince Leopold, which stood close to Lukow and Siedlce on the evening of August 11, was therefore set to advance with the right wing on Brest!).\n",
      "Commander-in-Chief East also had hope on this day that his 12th Army, advancing with a strong right wing on Ciechanowice, could at least intercept parts of the Russian troops that were heading further south from the west and southwest towards the Bug. However, he did not promise himself decisive successes from this. He considered it certain that the enemy would succeed in systematically evading in a northeasterly direction and wished to place the emphasis on further advance initially still in a generally easterly direction towards Bielsk, but later north of the forest of Bialowieza. In contrast, General von Gallwitz continued to advocate for the southeasterly direction.\n",
      "While troops of the army group Prince Leopold entered Lukow and Siedlce on August 12, the 12th Army encountered sustained resistance on the entire front north of the Bug on this day. However, during the night the enemy also withdrew here; the pursuit led together with the right wing of the 8th Army to the lower Narec and then into a line that ran west past Sokolow almost straight north to the Narew swamps of Wizna.\n",

The enemy seemed to have set up new resistance. The Supreme Army Command had General of Foot Artillery, Major General Schabel, examine whether it was possible to bring down the fortress of Osowiec by blowing and shooting gas. Since the reconnaissance had shown that with the available limited forces, for example only three heavy artillery batteries, even with the use of gas, there was no prospect of capturing the place, they had to wait until an advance on the eastern Bobr bank was opened. Here the 8th Army now had four divisions, while on the western bank its 11th Landwehr Division alone blocked the 50-kilometer-long swamp stretch.\n",
      "On the evening of August 13, the Commander-in-Chief East learned that the enemy was now retreating rapidly down the Bug in front of the Mackensen Army Group from the south. He had to, as it seemed, cross the river at Brest and below in a northeasterly direction. On the northern wing of the Prince Leopold Army Group, the Frommel Cavalry Corps had received the direction towards Kleszczele, \"to get behind the enemy parts retreating over the Bug.\" For the 12th Army, this initially changed nothing. Its commander was still full of hope. In an order he gave to the commanding generals that day, it was said that further advance of the army could lead to the destruction of the enemy. \"We must break the opposing resistance with all our might as quickly as possible. Extreme effort in the coming days will save us a lot of blood later. The goal is worth the effort.\"\n",
      "On August 14 and 15, the attack of the center (Plüskow Corps) and the XVII Reserve Corps, which had meanwhile moved in north of it, brought the decision for the 12th Army. East of Mazowiec, the 4½ division strong Russian XXI Corps retreated before the attack of the German 54th, 38th, and 86th Infantry Divisions, losing 2000 prisoners, as it is called in the official Russian account¹), \"defeated,\" and thus gave the entire Russian front between Bug and Narew the impetus for further retreat.</body>\n",

When the Supreme Army Command then pointed out again that 12 to 13 Russian corps were retreating before the Mackensen Army Group towards the Bug below Brest, and that a ruthless attack by the Prince Leopold and Hindenburg Army Groups promised great success, and that the right wing of the 12th Army under these circumstances had to maintain the direction eastward, towards Kleßzelle, this did not change the fact that the focus of their advance — as determined by position and terrain — had to remain initially directed towards Bielsk between Nurec and Narew. In this view, the Eastern Commander-in-Chief and the 12th High Command agreed, with the latter, as before, hoping to catch the retreating Russians, while the former thought of opening the Osowiec front.\n",
      "On August 16th, the 12th Army reported, in response to a direct inquiry from the Supreme Army Command about the state of the enemy, that it had suffered great bloody losses and lost many prisoners, but was still making strong counterattacks; it was still combat-ready and had more artillery and ammunition than in the previous week, its units were very mixed. The 8th Army, similarly questioned, also pointed out that the Russian use of ammunition had increased significantly in recent days. August 17th seemed to confirm this assessment of the enemy. Reports of counterattacks against the right wing of the German 12th Army prompted General von Gallwitz to order the XVII Army Corps stationed there to hold and strengthen its positions for the following day, and for the 9th Army, whose northern wing was occupied only by cavalry over a wide area, to bring in infantry support. Nevertheless, the continued attacks of the army in the direction of Bielsk, in which the 38th Infantry Division lost a high number of 750 men that day, caused the Russians to continue their retreat the following night, thus clearing the Bug crossing for the Prince Leopold Army Group.\n",
      "The evening of August 18th saw the German troops in the line Niemirow on the Bug — holders of the middle Nurec — before Bielsk and on the left bank of the Narew to the west of Tykocin. Here, the 8th Army had positioned the 10th Landwehr Division under Lieutenant General Clausius, which had already crossed the foot in the swampy terrain on both sides of the road leading from the south to Ostowiec.\n",

On August 19, the 12th Army attempted to advance at the decisive point against Bielsk. The 86th Infantry Division of the XVII Reserve Corps suffered extraordinarily heavy losses, losing 1300 men. However, decisive progress could not be achieved in the purely frontal battle.\n",
      "c) The Turn to the Northeast.\n",
      "On August 19, the Commander-in-Chief East, to regulate further pursuit, reported to the Supreme Army Command that he intended to \"focus the main pressure of the 12th Army in the direction of Bielsk—Narew (City), assuming that the left wing of the 9th Army will also be directed in a northeasterly direction, i.e., north of the Klejsczele—Gajnowka railway. Is the Supreme Army Command in agreement?\" — The response was: \"The Narew Assault Group of Army Group Hindenburg) must initially proceed in a purely eastern direction, securing its left flank against the Narew section with the right wing over Klejsczele, then continue north of the Policzna section. Emphasis must still be placed on rapid advancement over Bielsk. The group's departure to Ostrow can only occur when the situation with the enemy west and southwest of the Sialkowice forest is further clarified.\" This directive was further supplemented, as General von Falkenhayn on the same day explicitly emphasized that the opening of Ostowiec was at this moment less important than the uninterrupted continuation of the thrust along the left Narew bank along the river. At the same time, the southern wing of the 12th Army, \"due to good progress with Prince Leopold,\" could take a slightly more northerly direction; it should now proceed north past Klejsczele to Gajnowka. This at least approximately corresponded to the intentions of the Commander-in-Chief East, who then reorganized the tasks of all his armies. In the order, it was stated: \"Focus 12th Army direction Bielsk—Narew (City)—Mjalinowo, focus 8th Army direction Tykocin—Anyszyn.\" At the same time, the 10th Army was now to attack Wilna with the left wing. For this, the allocation of the two cavalry divisions of the 9th Army was requested from the Supreme Army Command, but on August 20, however, it was answered that only the German 9th Cavalry Division was released.\n",

      "The enemy continued to retreat according to his situation before the army group Prince Leopold rather than before the northern adjoining 12th Army. On the other hand, the increasing pressure against the rear of Osowiec prompted him to evacuate this place after the demolition of the works and bridges already on the night of August 23 and thus to retreat before the 8th and the left wing of the 12th Army. While the northern wing of the army group Prince Leopold reached the western edge of the Bialowies forest by the evening of August 24 in pursuit, the strong southern wing of the 12th Army fought hard beyond Bielsk. The center was still fixed before the upper Narew, the extreme left wing, the 37th Infantry Division, had already crossed it in connection with the Seydlitz Corps of the 8th Army west of Bialystok. Even further north, three Landwehr divisions of this army could follow the enemy over the abandoned Osowiec almost in one go to Knyszyn and to the Berezowka section.\n",
      "The difficulties that stood in the way of a more effective continuation of the offensive had increased significantly in the last ten days with the 12th Army. Already in the \"special orders\" of August 12, General von Gallwitz had pointed out that it was impossible for the stage to keep pace with the troops. The space to be bridged by the columns of the corps had to be stretched far beyond the usual measure, the oat supply reduced to half of the normal requirement. Since the harvest was now in the field or had just been brought in, the troops were to feed as much as possible from the land. In the area still untouched by the war, which had now been reached, essential parts of the supply needs were also provided in a reasonably sufficient quantity, because the enemy had no longer succeeded in removing or burning all the supplies of the vast area in time; but even the flour and bread supply could hardly be managed alongside the ammunition supply by the vehicle columns.\n",
      "Even a leader as strong-willed as General von Gallwitz had to increasingly take these conditions and the diminished attack power of the troops into account. Records of the responsible offices and leaders provide a picture of what it looked like in the army: In the war diary of the Watter Corps, it was already written on August 20: \"37 days continuously in combat, the infantry had only half its strength left, the field artillery material was unusable to a worrying extent.\"</body>\n",

On August 22, \"with regard to the urgently necessary ammunition savings, only very quiet artillery fire was maintained.\" The following day, the leader gained the impression in a conversation with the commanding general that due to the overexertion, the troops' offensive capability had significantly declined. It was expected from the artillery that \"it should do everything.\"\n",
      "In the Corps Stieren, according to its war diary on August 20, the last ammunition column was emptied, and the next filled one could only arrive on the 23rd. The heavy losses, it was said, especially of the 86th Infantry Division, were attributed to the inadequate artillery preparation due to a lack of ammunition. A regiment of the 50th Reserve Division had to be withdrawn from the front after it had shrunk from 57 officers to 6, from 3700 men to 600. The remaining troops, it was said in the report, mostly came from the \"last replacement, which arrived during the operation, was already classified as inferior and also proved to be inferior.\" New replacements, which were requested, would not find any old core in the regiment to give them support. The regiment needed 14 days to reorganize and regain internal strength.\n",
      "On August 22, the chief of staff of Corps Plüskow, Colonel Baercke, personally arrived at the army headquarters to describe the \"lack of striking power due to the small numbers and the shortage of officers.\"\n",
      "On August 24, Corps Parnewitz also reported: Since ammunition and supplies could not be brought up according to consumption, a three-day pause in the attack was necessary.\n",
      "General von Gallwitz himself judged in his diary entries on August 20: \"The Russian army report emphasized the tenacity of our attacks.\" But I could not deny that our strength was no longer what it used to be. For 39 days we had been fighting and had since then given up 1,400 officers and 60,000 men.\n",

A stop in the relentless push soon seemed inevitable.” The war diary of the High Command also pointed out the low combat strength of the infantry, which, as always, had to bear the brunt of the bloody losses as well as the mental and physical strain. Thus, the battalions of the 38th and 54th Infantry Divisions did not have 400 men of combat strength, and the 4th Guards Infantry Division counted only 4000 rifles in total. On August 21, General von Gallwitz could “no longer overlook the exhaustion of the troops.” The hope, temporarily held the following day, of repelling the enemy quickly shattered in the face of increasing difficulties. “It would be a pity,” he wrote in his diary, “if we were to falter now, because with the Russians, according to prisoner reports, letters, and their enormous losses, things look even bleaker. They are ripe for collapse if we can only apply the necessary force. Everywhere they show hopelessness, mainly because of our artillery... I wanted to wait yesterday to bring up artillery ammunition replacements. But the troops, who are of the best will, always act differently and thus awaken in the higher command the belief that it will still work. With battalions of 325 men, there is not much to be done. Now, the army has fulfilled its duty.” Russian counterattacks, which were also reported on this day, the General considered “to be repelled as ordered from above, as last attempts to turn the tide or at least to gain freedom of movement.”\n",
      "The conditions were more favorable than with the 12th Army at the 8th Army, which had not been fighting as long or as hard and had better supply conditions.\n",
      "With such a decisive reduction in the offensive power of the main army, it was ultimately of lesser importance which direction was given to the right wing of the Commander-in-Chief East for further action. The Supreme Army Command still wished to let the main force act in a purely eastern direction, while the Commander-in-Chief East, since the capture of Osowiec, considered a northeasterly direction necessary to at least indirectly support the advance of the 10th Army against Vilna²). He therefore ordered on August 24, in continuation of the instruction given on August 19 — as he had to believe — in agreement with the Supreme Army Command³), that “after the capture of Białystok” the railway from there via Sokolka to Grodno should form the boundary for the further operations of the 12th and 8th Armies.</body>\n",

In fact, in the following days, the 12th Army did not even have the opportunity, due to supply issues, to pursue with the remaining forces. On the evening of August 26, its left wing, together with the right of the 8th Army, was able to capture the important city of Białystok in battle. On August 27, the 12th Army reached the city of Narew behind the now rapidly retreating Russians, and on the 28th, the pursuit could only be continued with partial forces. The offensive of the strongest army advancing through northern Poland had stalled. A record by Captain von Waldow from the Eastern High Command the next day stated: \"The Russian is retreating systematically, and so quickly that we cannot follow with our rear connections. The railways are too badly destroyed. One could howl with rage. The 12th Army must actually halt in the pursuit and wait, and the Russian gets time to move forces to Wilna. Just now comes the news that a new corps is being unloaded there and is marching north. Our operation has not succeeded.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, a fundamental new order from the Supreme Army Command on August 27 halted the army groups Mackensen and Prince Leopold in view of the Rokkino swamps.

As countless testimonies prove, as far as its strength reached, it repeatedly approached the almost daily new attacks with joy and was rightfully filled with the proud consciousness of having pushed back a numerically superior enemy through all of Poland for about 200 kilometers.\n",
      "Tactically, everything was accomplished that — considering the given circumstances¹) — could be accomplished. If the attack results were not fully satisfactory in terms of the extent of captured materials and operational success, this primarily expresses that these were pure frontal battles, beginning with the breakthrough of an extremely strong and deeply structured position system that had developed over months of work, continued across a river section likewise prepared for sustained defense, and ending in pushing back an enemy who repeatedly put up resistance but always managed to evade a decisive battle in time. Stubborn resistance at strong natural sections, often combined with local counterattacks, alternated with unnoticed nightly withdrawals. The pursuit repeatedly came to a halt before new enemy positions, which were perhaps often only very weakly occupied. This continuously repeating pattern required not only time and strength but also disproportionate amounts of ammunition and cost the attacking infantry many officers and the best of the troops, so that finally only hastily trained war replacements and older age groups were bearing the burden of combat. The need for effective preliminary artillery work became all the more pressing. But its effectiveness was also no longer at the same level as at the beginning of the war due to worn-out gun barrels, less effective makeshift ammunition, and insufficient gunnery training of some batteries manned with older age groups. When one considers how much the strength of the Russian defense had increased simultaneously through the long-range effect of artillery and machine guns, despite great shortages of equipment and ammunition, one will properly appreciate the magnitude of what was achieved by leadership and troops.\n",
      "The destruction of the enemy had not been achieved, only its attrition. The captured numbers tell a clear story. In 6½ weeks, for 21 divisions of the German 12th and 8th Army, they totaled around 125,000 prisoners, 350 machine guns, but only 23 artillery pieces. How little this meant in its entirety, especially regarding the number of artillery pieces, becomes clear when one considers that at Tannenberg, 13 German divisions in six days captured 92,000 prisoners and 350 artillery pieces.</body>\n",

      "General von Falkenhayn pointed out after the war that the Gallwitz army, due to a lack of forces, was unable to give real emphasis to its left wing and was thus increasingly pushed in a purely Westphalian direction. The Commander-in-Chief East could very well have brought more forces to their attack, four divisions from the 9th and two from the 10th and the Njemen Army. \"Had the Narew assault group conducted their attack on the 14th with 20 divisions, it is highly probable that they would have been able to prevent strong parts of the enemy from withdrawing from the pincers. It is therefore a mistake that the reinforcement was omitted. Its cause must... be sought solely in the fact that it was not possible to bring about a unified understanding of the situation between the leading and executing positions.\" It should \"not have been tolerated\" that the main operation, \"for whatever reasons, a single man was withdrawn. As surely as it would have been primarily the responsibility of the high command to integrate into the overall operation, so surely was part of the responsibility for the fact that this did not happen on the chief of staff. His task was to ensure the complete surrender of each part as a whole and for the same, even where, as in this case, extraordinary personal difficulties stood in his way.\"\n",
      "The Commander-in-Chief East, who was decidedly opposed to the Narew operation from the outset and considered its continuation deep into August to be misguided, nevertheless did everything in his view to ensure its success. After the Kaiser had once decided very willingly for the proposal of his chief of staff, Field Marshal Hindenburg considered it his duty to leave nothing undone to help this plan succeed. Since then, he has used his entire authority for the success of the operation and personally positioned himself at the start of the attack on the battlefield at Przasnysz, because he knew \"what decisive importance our Supreme Army Command attached to the success of the ordered breakthrough.\"</body>\n",

      "<body>He went to the battlefield at Przasnysz because he knew \"what decisive importance our Supreme Army Command attached to the success of the ordered breakthrough.\" General Ludendorff, as the Field Marshal further wrote in his book, had indeed often internally adhered to the plan of the Njemen operation. This deviation \"had neither any influence on our further joint thinking and action,\" nor did it impair the \"strength with which we implemented the decision of the responsible Supreme Army Command in mid-July.\" Similarly, General Ludendorff himself wrote that the disagreements with General von Falkenhayn imposed on him the special obligation to implement the Supreme Army Command's thoughts, which differed from his own, \"if possible with even greater care than those that were consistent or his own.\"\n",
      "The Supreme Army Command was continuously informed about the measures of the Commander-in-Chief East, especially as far as they concerned the Army Group Gallwitz. Had it considered the deployment of forces against the Narew insufficient, it would have had to intervene decisively. Regarding the question of complete exposure of the front west of the Vistula, General Ludendorff expressed himself as follows: \"The release of the left bank of the Vistula west of the Sam mouth Nowogeorgiewsk was correct if the Supreme Army Command was firmly determined to fight for the decision in the East. Then it had to accept the risk of exposing the front. The enemy could not advance into the empty front. It was different if it had to be reckoned with the possibility that the operation against Russia might come to an early conclusion. Then the enemy, who no longer felt threatened far in Poland and Lithuania, could attack west of the Vistula.\" In a similar sense, General von Falkenhayn expressed himself to the Commander-in-Chief East on June 28, stating that the enemy would not be able to derive any significant benefit from the exposure of the front west of the Vistula \"as long as the advance between the Bug and Vistula\" — that is, the offensive of Army Group Mackensen — \"remained in progress.\" On the other hand, he almost continuously urged an attack by the 9th Army after July 2, even considering adding two more western divisions to it. Thus, the Supreme Army Command is at least fully responsible for leaving stronger forces west of the Vistula. A significant contrast between their view and that of the Commander-in-Chief East does not seem to have existed on this point.\n",

But General von Falkenhayn allowed the Commander-in-Chief East to act there as well, even repeatedly demanding active engagement for this section of the front. It is therefore quite questionable whether his idea that 20 instead of 14 divisions should have been deployed against the Narew is merely a retrospective consideration, which, however, cannot be denied justification.\n",
      "If the six divisions in question had been available at the beginning of the Narew operation, which was undoubtedly possible given the situation, intentions, and railway conditions, one could have attacked the enemy on July 13 at two places simultaneously, besides Przasnysz also at Ostrolenka—Nowogrod, with strong forces and thus not only split the Russian defense but above all given one's own attack a much more effective operational direction. Also, according to later experiences, an early, surprising attack at Ostrolenka—Nowogrod might have come faster and easier than at Pultusk—Rozan and over the Narew. In the course of the fighting, the attack front was eventually extended to Nowogrod. However, since the total strength for this was too low and it was the border area between the Gallwitz Army Group and the 8th Army, full unity of command at this point was not achieved. It was precisely here that troops were lacking, especially heavy artillery, because General von Gallwitz deliberately kept his left wing weak compared to the center of his front, where he initially sought tactical victory. In addition, disagreements with the General Command of the I Army Corps stationed in front of Ostrolenka and resulting fluctuations in orders had a detrimental effect. Only after overcoming the Narew itself did the center of the army group get bogged down in front of new Russian positions, did General von Gallwitz begin to shift the focus more to the left wing. And to achieve operational effect, it was already quite late.\n",
      "The Commander-in-Chief East gave the Gallwitz High Command, in which he had full confidence, free rein in conducting the operations. More serious disagreements about the pursuit direction only arose during the fighting between Bug and Narew, where the Gallwitz High Command could rely on the aligned view of the Supreme Army Command. However, it can hardly be proven that these contradictions affected the success of the operation.</body>\n",

      "<body>The task of pushing an enemy retreating in a broad, closed front into the Rokitno Marshes or, as General von Gallwitz occasionally expressed it, \"embracing\" them, was not feasible when the operational gain in 46 days was only 200 kilometers, averaging less than five kilometers per day. In contrast, the Russians, relying on relatively efficient railway connections, always had the opportunity to secure not only the fighting troops but also many other valuable assets. It might have seemed tempting to throw the parts that appeared to retreat northeast between the Rokitno Marshes and the advancing German armies from the west, numbering 13 to 14 corps, into that relatively manageable area and thereby inflict decisive damage. However, the Russian retreat direction was not aligned with the advance direction of the Gallwitz army in such a way that a flanking effect could be achieved. The northern Russian armies (2nd, 1st, and 12th Army) were brought back almost directly eastward to the Brest-Bialystok line, thus frontally, and only gradually adjusted to the growing demand for forces on the northern wing after abandoning the Slonim front; the 4th, 3rd, and 13th Army retreated diagonally from the south towards them. Thus, the transport of forces by rail in the general direction of Minsk-Wilna went hand in hand. Such a generously and properly managed retreat movement, even for parts of the army, to turn into a catastrophe, was beyond the striking power of a pursuer, who had almost uninterrupted fighting for four weeks in the first half of the attack and was already more than 100 kilometers away from the endpoints of efficient railway stations. And yet, great achievements were made. In cooperation with the Mackensen army group, the victories of the Gallwitz army and its neighbors on the right and left drove the enemy away from the threatening proximity of the German border. The capture of Warsaw and the spoils taken during the yet-to-be-described conquest of the large fortress of Nowogeorgiewsk must also be seen as direct consequences of the Narew campaign.</body>\n",

      "Nowogeorgiewsk was the largest and strongest of all Russian fortresses and the only fortification in western Poland that was exempted from decommissioning in 1910 and had since been further modernized. Located at the confluence of the Narew and Vistula, it secured, together with the outdated forts Dembe, Zegrze, and Benjamino to the east, the Narew crossing north of Warsaw and blocked the railway leading east of the Vistula to Warsaw, which had to cross the Wkra and Narew rivers within the fortress. Eight older forts, advanced beyond the city walls, enclosed an area of about eleven kilometers in diameter. On the north and west fronts, the Russians had begun a new line of fortifications, consisting of armored groups, four to five kilometers ahead of the old one. Since the beginning of the war, it had been rapidly expanded and extended to other fronts. In about the same distance beyond this outer line of fortifications, deeply structured, advanced positions had emerged.\n",
      "On July 17, the right wing of Army Group Gallwitz, Corps Dickhuth, and XVII Reserve Corps, advanced against the northern front of Nowogeorgiewsk. It was a fortunate coincidence that the chief engineer officer of the fortress, who had driven beyond his own lines in a motor vehicle, fell into German hands dead, but with valuable maps. The next day, the left wing of the 9th Army, Westernhagen Division, also approached the fortress's positions on the southern Vistula bank. By July 20, the XVII Reserve Corps' general command had concluded from intercepted Russian radio messages, aircraft, and patrol reports that only a weak enemy was opposite²); strong elements, the Russian XXVII Corps, seemed to be leaving the fortress to the south and east. Lieutenant General Surén considered it possible to take the fortress by storm the following day. However, General von Gallwitz prevented the execution of this plan, which was unlikely to succeed, although preparations had already begun. At the same time, the Eastern Commander-in-Chief appointed the commanding general of the III Reserve Corps, General of Infantry von Befeler, to lead the unified attack against the large fortress, who had already successfully led the conquest of Antwerp; the former quartermaster general of the 9th Army, Major General von Gaußewitz, joined him as chief of staff.\n",

      "The news of the impending fall of Warsaw prompted the acceleration of the attack: On August 5, the advance was to be made against the Narew bend Dembe—Serock; given the composition of the assault infantry from predominantly older age groups, General von Beseler demanded that the artillery must manage it. The bombardment of the positions advanced north of the forts Dembe and Zegrze was successful in causing the Russians, who had already abandoned Warsaw, to vacate these positions very quickly. After the wooded area behind was also cleared on August 6, the two forts could be occupied without a fight the next day, while at the same time on the eastern Narew bank the right wing of the 12th Army reached the Bug3). On August 9, the Wetzling detachment completed the encirclement of the fortress in the south up to the Vistula, above Thorn, corresponding to the progress of the 9th Army4), now also joining the siege troops, which on the same day were directly subordinated to the Supreme Commander East as the independent Army Group Beseler. When on August 10 a brigade of the 85th Landwehr Division could also seal off Nowogeorgiewsk in the east between Narew and Vistula, the ring around the fortress was closed.

Here, General von Beseler wanted to deploy his main forces and proceed similarly to the autumn of 1914 against Antwerp. Without formal siege, under the sharpest concentration of artillery effect, a breach was to be shot in a narrow strip of the attack section into the individual resistance lines, through which the closely following infantry was to penetrate in a rapid thrust. Operations against the other fronts were intended to make it difficult for the enemy to shift forces within the fortress area.\n",
      "The heaviest and heavy artillery alone counted 26 batteries with 113 guns at the attack front. However, a large part of these, especially among the inherently less worn flat trajectory guns, were of older type with only limited firing speed and range. Additionally, the ammunition situation imposed restrictions, as the large fortress of Kowno was also being attacked simultaneously, and a lack of columns made the procurement of ammunition extraordinarily difficult. Thus, the siege gun, the heavy field howitzer, initially had only 200 to 300 rounds each.\n",

      "After thirty hours of artillery effect, on August 13, the 14th Landwehr Division under Lieutenant General Schalscha von Rheinfeld and the Pfeil Brigade broke through the front enemy defense lines between Wkra and Narew on a narrow front and advanced close to the permanent tank groups XIV, XV, and XVI; about 2000 prisoners were the booty.

      "Under the impression of the previous German attack successes, the Russians evacuated their advanced positions on the entire northwest front up to the Vistula on the night of August 15. However, at the attack front itself, things did not initially progress as desired. An assault attempt by General von Schalscha against Fort XV a on the railway failed. General von Beseler considered refraining from the sap attack under these circumstances, but then decided to continue the artillery attack immediately and repeat the assault on August 16. After systematic and strongest artillery preparation against Groups XV and XVI and a subsequent multi-hour crisis, the assault against Group XV succeeded; Fort XV b was taken by Brigade Pfeil, capturing 500 prisoners, Fort XV a, the strongest work of the entire fortification belt, somewhat later by the 21st Landwehr Brigade; the total booty of the day was 2400 prisoners and 19 guns. The simultaneous attempts against the west, south, and east fronts initially brought no decisive progress, but the enemy also retreated to his armored groups here the following night.\n",

The order for this had already been given when the enemy evacuated the armored groups XIV and XVI on the night of August 18, leaving behind many prisoners and much equipment. Without a fight, the German troops could follow up to Nura, behind which the enemy, supported by the old forts, had re-established himself on new defenses. On August 18, the attack artillery opened fire against these forts; the infantry of the 14th Landwehr Division gained a foothold on the western bank of the Bieka.

Meanwhile, the enemy also evacuated all armored groups from the northwest front and retreated to the line of the old forts. Explosions and fires suggested that structures, ammunition, and supplies were destroyed.\n",
      "Fighting, the German troops penetrated the inner forts of the northeast front on August 19, later also entering the citadel. Here, the commander of the fortress, General Bobyr, was captured. The bulk of the garrison seemed to have retreated to the southern bank of the Vistula, whose bridges they had blown up, but surrendered there without making a serious breakthrough attempt, still in the afternoon hours to the German encirclement troops.

      "The cooperation of the attack by Mackensen's army group and Gallwitz's army group did not give the Russians time to evacuate the fortress of Nowogeorgiewsk as systematically as they had done with other fortresses. The evacuation of Warsaw had fully occupied the railways, and that of Nowogeorgiewsk would have required numerous additional 1000 trainloads. Thus, the Russian Supreme Command had already determined on July 5th that the fortress of Nowogeorgiewsk should be defended as an independent position to the utmost. The garrison and artillery equipment corresponded to this. It was calculated that the fortress could hold out for at least two months. The reason for the unexpectedly rapid fall was rightly attributed to the destructive power of the German artillery — one of the last radio messages from the commander spoke of an explosion in the citadel. Moreover, as the Chief of General Staff, General Januschkewitsch, remarked, \"God knows whether the German cannons alone are to blame. If 110,000 men had surrendered and 80,000 had fallen, that would be understandable. But 80,000 surrendered, and only 10,000 fell. One really cannot say that Nowogeorgiewsk fulfilled its task honorably.\"\n",

      "Soon after the capture of Lemberg, the armies fighting in Galicia were given new, separate tasks by the allied military commands1). The 11th and Austro-Hungarian 4th Armies were to advance northward between the Bug and Vistula under the unified command of Field Marshal von Mackensen to press the southern flank of the Russian forces in Poland. The three armies of the right wing, the Austro-Hungarian 2nd, the Southern Army, and the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army, were tasked with covering this operation with a front directed eastward. To avoid any gap between the inner wings of both army groups and to ensure the immediate flank protection of the 11th Army, the prompt advancement of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, positioned between the Bug and Vistula for relief, was intended to move over Lemberg to the Bug2). Until this could be effective, the 11th Army had to protect its flank directly and hold its right wing — Beskiden Corps, Corps Kneussl (119th Infantry Division and 11th Bavarian Infantry Division), Austro-Hungarian VI Corps — staggered to the right.\n",
      "The left wing of the 11th Army (Guard Corps, XXII Reserve and X Army Corps) opened the previously unsuccessfully attacked Taneo section to the left neighboring Austro-Hungarian 4th Army by continuing its advance towards Zamosc in the last days of June. In a rapid march, this army overcame the swamp and forest area of that section on June 30, despite significant route difficulties, and pushed its left wing almost up to the height of Krasnik. The results of the reconnaissance indicated a retreat of the Russians along the entire line northeast behind the Bug and into a position running from Hrubieszow over Krasnik to Josefow. In the foreground of this position, northeast of Zamosc, at the Labunka and especially at the Por, the three corps of the left wing of the 11th Army already encountered sustained resistance on July 1st,\n",

      "Already on July 1, he had placed decisive importance on the fastest possible and uninterrupted advance of the army group in a discussion with Army Command 11 in Rawa Ruska and had Generalmajor v. Kappen point out in Teschen the next day that the right wing of the 11th Army in the Bug defense should be quickly relieved by the 2nd Army and that the 1st Army, designated as future flank protection, should be made as strong as possible. In a personal discussion with Generaloberst v. Conrad on July 3 in Teschen, he further suggested strengthening the 11th Army with the entire South Army to lend the staff of the Mackensen army group the greatest emphasis. However, since the Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff expressed concerns about whether the east-facing defensive front would remain strong enough, it was finally agreed to initially withdraw only two divisions from the South Army to reinforce the 11th Army after crossing the Zlota Lipa. On the evening of July 3, General von Falkenhayn urgently pointed out to Army Command 11 that any delay in the advance must be avoided, \"for the longer the enemy holds time and the railway at Lublin, the harder he will be to defeat.\" However, Field Marshal von Mackensen was able to report to him on the morning of July 4 that the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, which had meanwhile significantly expanded its breakthrough east of Krasnik on July 3, had by no means been halted; rather, it should continue the offensive together with the left wing of the 11th. However, he dutifully combined this report with the note that a very strong consumption of forces had already occurred in the attacked armies, and that the bulk of the 11th Army would only be capable of new attacks when effective relief for it was achieved through the deployment of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army around July 13. General von Falkenhayn now again urgently pointed out to Army Command 11 on the evening of July 4 that any delay in the advance must be avoided. He also once again approached Generaloberst von Conrad with the request to expedite the relief of the Beskiden Corps by the 2nd Army and the transport of the 1st Army. At the same time, he requested the immediate transfer of the two divisions of the South Army and their command to form a new army within the Mackensen army group.\n",

The Mackensen High Command reported in the evening that no fewer than four new Russian corps¹) had been identified in front of their line. The pursuit of the 11th Army had essentially come to an end. Nevertheless, the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army hoped to continue its push towards Lublin after replenishing its ammunition supplies. However, July 7 and 8 brought significant setbacks. The right flank and center were pushed back to the area of Krasnix. Relief by the left flank was widely dispersed, and the heavily weakened 11th Army was no longer able to assist. The attack between the Bug and Vistula had stalled. Meanwhile, the Russians continued their counterattacks only briefly and without much force. Both sides dug in along the entire front.\n",
      "The reinforcement deemed necessary by General von Falkenhayn for a successful continuation of the offensive in the area between the Bug and Vistula depended on the developments at the neighboring fronts. The Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army and the Southern Army²) had only slowly gained ground from section to section since the end of June in daily, partly heavy fighting. The tenacious enemy frequently launched strong counterattacks on this front. Only on July 5 was the 2nd Army in undisputed possession of the line Dunajow—Busk—Kamionka Strumilowa. To its right, the Southern Army had already reached the west bank of the Zlota Lipa from Dunajow the day before. On the same day, the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army advanced very small forces of its left flank at Butowka to the northern Dniester bank, while gathering all dispensable forces to form a strong reserve around Horodenka, as they expected Russian attacks in the area of Jaleszczyki. With the capture of the Zlota Lipa and Bug lines, the allied army commands considered the advance of the right army wing in Galicia temporarily concluded.

The German Chief of Staff had rejected this and added that instead of the current command of the Southern Army, which was transferring to the Mackensen Army Group, General of Infantry Count von Bothmer would take over the command of the army with his general command. Consequently, the Southern Army relinquished its general command of the X Reserve Corps (General of Infantry Roß) with the 101st and 105th Infantry Divisions. On the evening of July 6, the commander-in-chief, General von Linsingen, was recalled with his staff and took command of the newly forming Bug Army on the right flank of the Mackensen Army Group. In the following days, the Southern Army was further weakened by the transfer of the 1st Infantry and 5th Cavalry Divisions, as well as the general command of the XXIV Reserve Corps (General of Infantry von Gerok) to the Mackensen Army Group.\n",

An infantry division moved east of the Vistula to the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, while the remaining parts were transported by rail via Lemberg behind the right flank of the 11th Army to the Bug downstream from Kamionka Strumilowa. Here, the Szurmay Group and the 46th Infantry Division from the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army joined them. The Woyrsch Army Detachment took over the entire front west of the Vistula up to the Pilica.

      "<body>Generaloberst von Conrad proposed that the Austro-Hungarian 4th and 11th Armies, with their left wing along the Vistula and their right on Cholm, should attack, with the Bug Army to the right of them — this with a strong group east of the Bug on Wladimir Wolynsk. On the western Vistula bank, the Army Detachment Woyrsch was to advance in coordination with the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army in the general direction of Iwoslen. Generaloberst von Conrad envisioned covering this decisive main operation to the east in an offensive form by advancing the Austro-Hungarian 1st and 2nd Armies and the Southern Army up to the line Zimno (south of Wladimir Wolynsk)—Druzkopol—Pieniatin—course of the Sereth, while the 7th Army was to simultaneously push northwards east of the Strypa. In these proposals, General von Falkenhayn saw the danger of a fragmentation of forces; he agreed with them only regarding the use of the 4th and 11th Armies and the Army Detachment Woyrsch. However, he wanted the Bug Army to closely cooperate with the 11th Army to increase the striking power on this side of the Bug. Furthermore, he desired the involvement of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army in the operations of Army Group Mackensen under the command of the Generalfeldmarschall. It was to advance east of the Bug against the line Wladimir Wolynsk—Luzk to protect the Allies' offensive on the right flank. The head of the operations department, Generalmajor Tappen, went even further in the objectives for this army. He advocated that it should be reinforced by German troops to quickly and securely take control of that line \"as a starting point for repelling the Russians.\" If the foundation were thus laid for the possibility of always keeping the Russians from evading eastwards, they would have to come into a very bad situation under the simultaneous pressure of General von Gallwitz's offensive; under certain circumstances, they could even be encircled if they held their ground.\" This aligned with the view of the head of the Field Marshal's staff, Generalmajor Groener, who wrote in his diary on July 4: \"In my opinion, a strong army east of the Bug is necessary.\" General von Falkenhayn opposed such an extensive offensive goal east of the Bug, as \"given everything known about the terrain beyond the Bug, it was feared that this alone would present insurmountable obstacles to further operations.</body>\n",

He assumed that it was primarily important not only to throw the enemy but above all to cut off a retreat in an easterly direction. Only by quickly advancing the Bug Army on the western, the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army on the eastern bank, could the enemy's retreat still be blocked. However, this required a reinforcement of the Bug Army and a reduction of its attack front.\n",

The Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, in a frontal attack against the strong position behind the broad Wolica depression, could only achieve local progress with significant losses. However, a full success was achieved west of the Wieprz. Under the pressure of a powerful thrust by the inner wings of the XXII Reserve and X Army Corps, exemplarily from Goltzowa, the Russians, simultaneously pressured by the Guard Corps at the front, were forced to quickly abandon the Wieprz-Wolica angle. By deploying the 119th Infantry Division on the right wing of the X Army Corps, the attack wedge could be pushed further north to Izdebno. On this day, the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army did not yet launch a unified attack.\n",

However, the 11th Army managed to exploit its success west of the Wieprz despite increased resistance. Krasnostaw succumbed to the assault of the Guard. Under a flanking cover pushed north on the west bank of the Wieprz, the infantry of the Guard Corps crossed the Wieprz and gained a bridgehead east of Krasnostaw. To be able to quickly move the parts of the 2nd Guard Infantry Division of Lieutenant General Freiherr von Aßtritz, still standing at the Wolica front, the 105th Infantry Division was to be deployed for their relief. This division and the adjacent 22nd Infantry Division, which had succeeded in crossing the Wolica at a spatially limited point, were subordinated to General of Infantry Kosch. To the left of the Guard Corps, the XXII Reserve and X Army Corps fought back and forth over Izdebno. The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, attacking on a broad front, still gained no ground today.

      "The previous result of the offensive was minor. Only the three corps of the left wing of the 11th Army had breached the Russian front west of the Wieprz in a spatially limited manner. The stubborn resistance that the enemy had offered in the first three days of fighting, and the reports received by July 18 about his force distribution, gave the commander of the army group the conviction that very strong Russian forces must have been deployed between the Bug and the Vistula, determined to fight the decisive battle. He even expected a counterattack from the Cholm—Lublin line, at least the strongest defense in this line. On the other hand, he no longer considered an advance of the Russians from the east over the Bug against the right flank likely. He therefore believed he had to concentrate his forces as much as possible in the area between the Bug and the Vistula, where the decision was being fought, but could forego the transfer of stronger forces of the b.-ö. 1st Army to advance from Krylow to Vladimir Volynsk. This army was instructed to only gain bridgeheads on the Bug, which should serve as a fallback for the cavalry corps of General von Hebred (German 5th, Austro-Hungarian 4th, and Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division) to be deployed later on Vladimir Volynsk—Luzk. The Bug security of the 1st Army was to extend downstream to Slupce. Since the army no longer needed the XXXXI Reserve Corps for this purely defensive task, it was to join the Bug Army and increase its striking power. This seemed all the more necessary to him, as this army had not yet succeeded in advancing by July 18.\n",
      "In the 11th Army, the breach in the enemy position widened on this day. The bulk of the 105th Infantry Division of Major General von der Esch, deployed to the Wolica front, was moved west of the Wieprz behind the guard and pushed through the bridgehead of the Wieprz to the east. Immediately starting heavy counterattacks by the Russian guard from the north and east brought this advance to a halt and thus enabled the extremely threatened Russian garrison of the Wolica position to retreat. The Austro-Hungarian VI Corps and the 22nd Infantry Division simultaneously pushed frontally over this section after the retreating enemy. Also west of the Wieprz, the cavalry corps and the left wing of the XXII Reserve Corps had to fend off strong counterattacks. The initially well-advancing left wing of this corps did not get beyond Olszanka. In front of the X Army Corps, the enemy offered sustained resistance only in a new position northwest of Izdebno.</body>\n",

      "On July 19, the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army expanded its bridgehead at Sokal and was able to establish a foothold north of Iczary on the eastern bank of the Bug. The Heydebreck Cavalry Corps began to cross the river. The army was again reminded that further advances beyond the Bug were not appropriate, but that the prompt relief of the XXXXI Reserve Corps was necessary, as it had occupied the western bank of the Bug on both sides of Krylow and was simultaneously striving to maintain the connection to the Bug Army to the north. This army was now in full forward movement, as the enemy had retreated along its entire front during the night of July 19. Covered on the right flank by the 1st Infantry Division at the Bug, the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division pushed the enemy back behind the Huczwa, which had become boggy due to the recent rains. The 107th Infantry Division, led by Major General von Moser, advanced north of Zaborez. Here, the Russians retreated successfully in the face of further advances into the rear of their position at Hrubieszow. The territorial gain was significantly greater on the left wing of the army, where the Beskiden Corps under General of Cavalry von der Marwitz was able to follow the retreating enemy to Woslawice. To continue the pursuit the next day along the entire line, Hrubieszow was to be taken early by encirclement from the west.\n",
      "In front of the 11th Army, the enemy retreated further east of the Wierpz under the double pressure in the front and against its rear from the bridgehead east of Krasnystaw. The Austro-Hungarian VI Corps followed and reached the stream section at Siemnica Krolewska with its left wing. As the troops of General Korsch (22nd and 105th Infantry Divisions) and parts of the Guard Corps gathered northeast of Krasnystaw, the former were to be withdrawn again. Along this entire line, they now found themselves facing newly reinforced positions. On the eastern bank of the river, however, the advance already took on more of the character of a pursuit. The left wing of the Guard Corps swung towards Wierpz. The XXII Reserve Corps advanced beyond Lopiennik. The X Army Corps, however, drove its spearhead towards Piaski under great marching efforts and thus stood close to the intended target, the Cholm—Lublin road.\n",

      "Thus, by the evening of the fifth day of the attack on the battlefield between Bug and Vistula, a significant spatial success was recorded almost along the entire line. However, the enemy had managed to avoid a decision by a systematic retreat into well-prepared positions. Their combat strength, which had also manifested in effective counterattacks, was by no means broken.\n",
      "Meanwhile, on the western bank of the Vistula, the Army Detachment Woyrsch had achieved a significant success south of the Ilzanka, which did not remain without influence on the enemy front opposite the Mackensen Army Group. On the morning of July 17, the right wing of the Army Detachment broke into the Russian position and forced the enemy to retreat. In pursuit, the Ilzanka was reached by the evening of July 18. The group Kövesz on the left wing was also able to follow the withdrawing enemy on July 19 to the line Starzyez—Kowala—west of Przylot—west of Wysmierzyce. This began to make the operational cooperation of the forces on both sides of the Vistula noticeably threatening for the Russians. According to the orders of Field Marshal von Mackensen, the enemy between Bug and Vistula was to be withdrawn to their main positions everywhere on July 20 and these themselves attacked on July 21.\n",
      "Things did not proceed as systematically as planned. Initially, it was a surprise that the enemy attacked the bridgeheads of the southern and 1st Army on the eastern bank of the Bug with strong forces on July 20 and pushed back their garrisons. The Cavalry Corps Heydebreck had to vacate the barely won eastern bank again. This delayed the relief of the XXXXI Reserve Corps intended to strengthen the Bug Army. Field Marshal von Mackensen did not allow the deployment of the 103rd Infantry Division of Major General von Esfom, requested by the 1st Army, for a counterattack on the eastern bank.\n",
      "The Bug Army also encountered unexpected obstacles. The hope of General von Liningen that the enemy would succumb to the attack comprehensively directed against Hrubieszow was initially not fulfilled. The thrust of the 107th Infantry Division, conducted from the west against the heights north of Hrubieszow, did not penetrate. To give this flank attack greater force, the 11th Bavarian Infantry Division of Major General Ritter von Kneussl was replaced by the 1st Infantry Division of Lieutenant General von Conta and moved across to the western bank of the Huczwa.</body>\n",

Since the Besikden Corps also had to postpone its attack due to uncertain weather to July 21, General von Linsingen decided to bring down Hrubieszow the next day through a frontal attack by the 1st Infantry Division south of the Huczwa and by encircling with the 11th Bavarian and 107th Infantry Division from the west. He hoped in this way to separate the Russian forces west and east of the Bug.\n",
      "The striking power of the 11th Army was reduced by the days of fighting and marches on roads made impassable by rain. Its territorial gain on July 20 in new fierce battles against the enemy, reinforced by significant fresh forces, was therefore only slight. The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, which had shifted its focus to the right flank, unsuccessfully attempted to break through in connection with the 11th Army at Chmiel.\n",
      "Field Marshal von Mackensen saw no danger in the strong deployment of forces against the Bug bridgeheads of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army. It even seemed desirable to him that the enemy, feeling threatened here, would tie down forces away from the decisive battle. Apparently, the Russians had no intention of advancing over the Bug themselves. Since the use of the Heydebreck Cavalry Corps east of the Bug was not possible at the time, the Field Marshal ordered on July 21 that his cavalry divisions (the German 5th and Austro-Hungarian 4th) on the western Bug bank should free up the XXXXI Reserve Corps as soon as possible for use at the front of the Bug Army. The Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division was assigned to the Bug Army. Due to shifts within the front, the attack of this army was only carried out in the course of the afternoon. The enemy abandoned Hrubieszow under pressure against his right flank and rear. He was pushed back from Hrubieszow to the north and onto Zabudce. The Besikden Corps succeeded in taking the position on both sides of Wosjlawice on a broad front and then holding it against counterattacks. General von Linsingen believed that these counterattacks served as the prelude to further retreat and therefore ordered that the XXXXI Reserve Corps should soon intervene in the battle over Hrubieszow with the 1st Infantry Division, and the 11th Cavalry Division should follow the army group. The 11th Army encountered the hardest resistance on both banks of the Huczwa. However, the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army succeeded in breaking into the enemy on both sides of Trzciniec.</body>\n",

Field Marshal von Mackensen informed the commander-in-chief, Field Master von Puhallo, that for operational reasons he no longer valued the bridgeheads, only the absolute holding of the river section was necessary. The b. and 2nd Army continued their attack on the right flank. The foremost parts of the XXXXI Reserve Corps had to turn east against the enemy immediately after passing through Hrubieszow, who was standing in the river bend west of Uscilug. To the north, the 1st Infantry Division Woyrsch fought. The Gerdt Corps advanced further west, but encountered new heavily fortified positions at and east of Teratyn. The Beskiden Corps could only hold its lines in changing battles. The divisions of the 11th Army were at the end of their striking power and dug in.

The left army wing advanced on the Vistula to Imitlowice, as ordered by the High Command Mackensen, to maintain the connection with the Army Detachment Woyrsch.\n",
      "Before this, the enemy had already vacated the stubbornly defended position north of the Ilzanta on the morning of July 19 after fierce night battles. By the evening of July 22, the two wings of the Army Detachment Woyrsch reached the Vistula, partly only after overcoming new resistance, above Iwangorod in the line Janowice–Patkowice, below Iwangorod in the line west of Pawlowice–Ryczwol to the Pilica estuary.

The 4th Army will initially cover the middle Vistula, then withdraw, initially to the north.\" The enemy thus seemed to be preparing a large backward swing behind the Bug. Field Marshal von Mackensen did not conceal that it would be desirable for the army group to strike the flank of the Russian retreat with a successful thrust.

Therefore, he reported with a heavy heart to the Supreme Army Command his decision to \"continue the advance northward with a strong center and cover against the east only after a necessary pause in combat.\"\n",
      "This decision did not surprise the German Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army. He himself had viewed the prospects as extremely favorable on July 19¹, but on the 21st wrote to the Commander-in-Chief East²: \"The Mackensen Army Group faces a far superior enemy. Those of its troops that must advance have been severely battered by almost three months of mobile warfare, and their right flank requires constant attention. It is therefore not to be assumed that the army group can advance on its own.\" For the leader of overall operations, however, a pause in the offensive of the Mackensen Army Group called into question the success of his own plans, which were aimed at a decisive blow against the main body of the enemy. The previously favorable course of events, especially on the Narew Front, had only recently awakened in him the hope \"that the decision in the fight against Russia would fall in the area south of the Narew\"³. To achieve this goal, the concentric pressure from the northwest and south against the enemy masses located in the area between the Bug and Vistula could not be allowed to slacken even temporarily. It was therefore crucial to get the stalled offensive of the Mackensen Army Group back on track as quickly as possible. General von Falkenhayn, in the aforementioned letter to the Commander-in-Chief East, identified the uninterrupted continuation of the Narew operation, using all available forces, as the most effective means, since immediate support for the Mackensen Army Group by bringing in fresh units appeared unfeasible due to unfavorable railway and supply conditions⁴ in Galicia and southern Poland.\n",
      "At the same time, he was also eager to bring the forces still west of the Vistula, such as the 9th Army and the Woyrsch Army Detachment, to bear on the course of the war beyond the river as soon as possible⁵. On July 21, he therefore proposed to Colonel General von Conrad to combine these two formations into an army group directly subordinate to the German Supreme Army Command under the command of Prince Leopold of Bavaria and to launch an attack across the Vistula between Iwangorod and Warsaw in the direction of Lublin–Siedlce.</body>\n",

      "Prince Leopold of Bavaria to unite and launch an attack over the Vistula between Iwangorod and Warsaw in the direction of Lublin–Siedlce. This idea undoubtedly corresponded to the understandable wish of the German Chief of General Staff to secure a stronger immediate influence on the continuation of overall operations on the eastern theater of war by incorporating some Austro-Hungarian units into the German command area, in line with the numerous German contributions to the Austro-Hungarian command. He also had sufficient reasons from the standpoint of overall war leadership to bring the fight against Russia to a successful conclusion as quickly as possible, in order to free up forces for use in the West as well as — given the precarious situation of the Turkish ally — to exert \"pressure on the Balkan states.\"\n",
      "However, his proposal met with decisive rejection from the Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff. He had already previously ordered, in accordance with the existing agreements of the Army Detachment Woyrich, to cross the Vistula above Iwangorod under security against the fortress and to engage in the battle of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army. He now requested General von Falkenhayn to maintain the existing command relationships, as the operations of the Army Detachment Woyrich were connected with those of the Mackensen Army Group, while the 9th Army was linked with the Narew attack. General von Falkenhayn immediately pointed out in his response that the consolidation of the two armies was precisely intended to deploy them in the most effective direction, in this case, to attack the Russian forces opposing Field Marshal von Mackensen from the rear. However, Generaloberst von Conrad persisted in his position, arguing that an attack over the Vistula below Iwangorod would be too time-consuming and would give the enemy the opportunity to shift forces from the Vistula bend against both the Mackensen Army Group and the Gallwitz Army Group. The exchange of views on this matter continued for several days without result. Even a personal discussion between the two Chiefs of General Staff in Teschen on July 24 initially brought no agreement. Only after Field Marshal von Mackensen assured General von Falkenhayn in response to an inquiry that the situation at the front of his army group could definitely be maintained by its own strength until the Vistula crossing became effective, did Generaloberst von Conrad agree to General von Falkenhayn's proposal to the extent that the Army Detachment Woyrsch should force the crossing below Iwangorod.\n",

The 3rd and 13th Armies were tasked with delaying the advance of the Mackensen Army Group towards Brest Litovsk through offensively conducted resistance. In particular, the area around Vladimir Volynsk east of the Bug was to be held as long as possible.

Counterattacks by the Russians in the following days were repelled. The overall result of these several days of bitter fighting by the Bug Army was minimal. They only proved that their severely exhausted and weakened divisions alone were not able to break the stubborn resistance of the enemy. Here too, a pause in fighting was absolutely necessary to resume the attack together with the other armies.\n",

He did not fail to recognize that a new eastern thrust, with partial forces on the right bank of the Bug, could effectively hit the enemy if he, as assumed, retreated to the northeast. However, this would have required time-consuming regroupings. The terrain near the Bug, with its numerous watercourses and swampy areas, was also considered particularly unfavorable for movements and battles of large troop masses. Furthermore, it was expected that the enemy would offer particularly stubborn resistance on his outer army wing to cover the withdrawal of his masses over the middle Bug. From a further westward thrust, the Field Marshal finally hoped, in close cooperation with the Woyrsch Army Detachment, to quickly outflank the Russian Vistula front still held on both sides of Swangorod.

      "The main breakthrough point for the 11th Army was again determined to be the front west of the Wieprz. Here, a strong assault group under the command of General von Emmich (XXII Reserve Corps, Corps Roßki, X Army Corps, 119th Infantry and Guard Cavalry Division) was to first break through at Biskupice and then throw strong rear echelons to the south for a flank attack east over the Wieprz. This was intended to ease the difficult frontal attack over the fire-rich Siemnica section for the right-adjoining front (Guard Corps and Austro-Hungarian VI Corps). After reaching the first objectives, the main round was to be moved from the western Wieprz bank to the eastern one. The army reserve (the 22nd and the 103rd Infantry Division, transferred from the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army) was therefore positioned immediately east of the river. The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army was to join the attack with a strong right wing in the direction of Lublin. It extended to the right into the area northeast of Chmiel to facilitate both the crossing of the Giełczew stream by the left wing of the 11th Army and to flank the enemy standing in front of its own front. The center, where the German 47th Reserve Division was located, was to continue the frontal breakthrough northwest of Trzcianice. Additionally, the army was instructed to swing its left wing at the Vistula to hold Russian forces that might otherwise turn against the army detachment Woyrsch tasked with the crossing below Iwangorod. The Bug Army was assigned the dual task of covering the right flank of the 11th Army and participating in the new offensive by advancing on Cholm as long as possible.\n",
      "According to the enemy force grouping reports, the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army (five infantry and two cavalry divisions²) faced seven Russian infantry divisions and two cavalry corps on the eastern Bug bank. More than ten Russian divisions were massed in front of the Bug Army, which numbered eight infantry divisions.</body>\n",

The Russians were supposed to have freshly assembled their formations. Artillery ammunition also seemed to be more plentiful with them now.\n",
      "General von Emmich wanted to lead the decisive attack entrusted to him by breaking out fan-like from the area on both sides of Fajslawice. The Kosch Corps was to break through the enemy position in the direction of Biskupice. Accordingly, the mass of heavy artillery was deployed here. To the right of it, the XXII Reserve Corps was to advance with a strong left wing north of Fajslawice and then attack eastwards below Lopiennik over the Wieprz. The flank security above Lopiennik was taken over by the Guard Cavalry Division. The X Army Corps had to provide strong parts on its right wing to cover the left flank of the Kosch Corps against a threat from the large forest west of Fajslawice. The task of the left corps wing, however, was to join the attack of the neighboring army directed to the northeast west of the Gielczew stream.\n",
      "General Kosch focused on the left wing of his corps. Here, the 105th Infantry Division of Major General von Eich succeeded, after repeated sharp fire concentration, in storming the elevated group of houses Ignasin (west of Fajslawice), the focal point of the enemy position, soon after 7 a.m. In a powerful swing, the division expanded its success to both sides. The 101st Infantry Division, led by Major General Reißer, also managed to advance its attack east of this place at noon, supported on the left flank over Fajslawice, and to pull along the left wing of the XXII Reserve Corps. In the early afternoon, the 44th Reserve Division, following in the second line under Lieutenant General von Dorrer, advanced east over the Wieprz. The 20th Infantry Division, led by Lieutenant General Ritter and Edler von Deiting, offensively covered the left flank of the Kosch Corps by advancing east of the Gielczew stream in the direction of Piaśki. Under the impact of these all-round successes, the enemy abandoned further resistance in a rearwardly developed position and vacated the area in the Wieprz-Gielczew arc. Overnight, the 101st Infantry Division seized the northern Wieprz bridges northeast of Fajslawice, while the 105th Infantry Division on the left of relentlessly advanced northward and captured Biskupice by midnight.\n",

      "The battle on the eastern bank of the Wieprz was not as successful. To make the flank attack of the XXII Reserve Corps over the river as effective as possible, General von Emmich moved the 119th Infantry Division to Fajsławice. By 4 p.m., strong parts of the XXII Reserve Corps had already crossed the Wieprz after executing the right turn. However, strong resistance then set in, as the enemy recognized the threat posed to its south-facing front by this rear threat from the Guard Corps and the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps. Therefore, the XXII Reserve Corps was unable to advance further east today. Consequently, the Prussian Guard Corps also achieved only minor local successes on both sides of Krupie in its frontal attack against the stubborn resistance of the Russian Guard. Similarly, the left wing of the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, which joined this attack, did not achieve significant territorial gains.\n",
      "The Bug Army now showed how much the previous battles had sapped the striking power of the troops. The combat pause had been too short. The attack, whose focus was on the 1st and 11th Bavarian Infantry Divisions west of Annopol, did not break through despite local advances by both divisions. The Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army maintained its bridgeheads on the Bug despite some local losses. The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army also did not achieve any greater success.\n",
      "Overall, the gain of the first day of the attack was thus limited to the successful breakthrough of Emmich's assault group into the enemy's position west of the Wieprz. The aim was now to expand this success so that it also affected the adjoining fronts to the right and left. To this end, Field Marshal von Mackensen ordered General von Emmich to continue with as strong forces as possible on July 30, while maintaining the line from Dorfbis east of the Wieprz, to bring down the particularly well-fortified enemy position in front of the Guard Corps and the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps. At the same time, these two corps were to attack anew at the front. If the strike east of the Wieprz succeeded, it was hoped that the difficult attack of the Bug Army would also gain momentum.\n",

The decisive factor for this change was the fact that the Woyrich Army Detachment had succeeded on July 29 in crossing the Vistula below Iwangorod at several points. It was hoped that this threat to the rear would weaken the enemy's resistance in front of the left wing of the 4th Army.\n",
      "On the early morning of July 30, Field Marshal von Mackensen was unexpectedly faced with a new situation: The enemy, having timely recognized the great danger threatening east of the Wieprz, had begun a retreat during the night almost along his entire front between the Bug and the Vistula into a new position, which, as reconnaissance revealed, ran approximately along the line Matcze (on the Bug)—south of Cholm—north of Lublin—Kurów. This too was strongly fortified according to intelligence reports, with the involvement of the civilian population. West of Kurów, it found support at Nowo Alexandrija on the Russian Vistula front around Iwangorod. Once again, as so often before, the enemy had evaded the decisive blow intended for him at the last moment. Once again, the army group seemed to face the equally difficult, exhausting, and thankless task of a frontal attack against a strong position. For the pursuit immediately undertaken by all three armies quickly came to an end.\n",
      "On July 31, the enemy was pushed back from the field to his main position, partly again under the fiercest fighting. In the Bug Army, the 1st and 11th Bavarian Infantry Divisions successfully advanced over Strzelce. The army was instructed to focus its further advance in the direction of Cholm. Also on the left wing of the 11th Army, the X Army Corps succeeded in breaking into the Russian position west of the Wieprz. The left wing of the 4th Army advanced into the area around Kurów. Its right wing received a direction to the northeast towards Lenczna. The 11th Army was to succeed in making a connection of its striking power in a narrower space impossible. The decisive attack planned by Field Marshal von Mackensen on August 1 with the Emmich Group on both sides of the main road Fajslawice—Wlodawa, with the Plettenberg Group (Guard Corps, 22nd and 103rd Infantry Division) east of it, left wing over Pawlow, was to be conducted. It still seemed as if the Russians were determined, despite the previous failures of their entire front in Poland, to hold against the concentrated attacks of the Allies.</body>\n",

      "<body>The military success of the 11th Army at Biskupice, which had revitalized the offensive of the Mackensen Army Group, coincided with an equally important event on the left neighboring front, the crossing of the Army Detachment W o y r s c h over the Vistula. Generaloberst von Woyrsch, based on the directive received on the evening of July 21 from the Austro-Hungarian Army Command, to engage with the strongest possible forces over Nowo Aleksandrija in the battle of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, immediately set the crossing above the fortress Ertrunkungen against the line Nowo Aleksandrija—Golomb. The crossing was to take place on the night of July 24 to 25 at Nowo Aleksandrija, with a simultaneous feint by the Landwehr Division of General Count von Bredow at Janowice. During a meeting with General von Falkenhayn on July 23, however, the Chief of Staff of the Army Detachment, Lieutenant Colonel Heye, expressed concerns about the crossing at Nowo Aleksandrija, as the advantage of surprise would be lost at this location, and suggested crossing below the fortress instead. Apart from the possibility of surprise, continuing the thrust here would strike the rear of the enemy opposing the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army and have a significantly more favorable operational impact. General von Falkenhayn, who, as already mentioned, shared the same view, proposed a corresponding modification after consultation with Generaloberst von Conrad.\n",
      "Meanwhile, preparations for the crossing at Nowo Aleksandrija were begun for all eventualities. Only on the late evening of July 24 did the new directive from Teschen reach the High Command in Radom, according to which the Vistula crossing below Iwangorod in the area of the Radomka estuary was to be forced by the Landwehr Corps and the Landwehr Division Bredow. The Austro-Hungarian XII Corps of General von Kövess was tasked with securing the river from the Chodel estuary downstream to Kozienice, enclosing Iwangorod, and attacking the fortress upon the arrival of heavy artillery. General von Falkenhayn added to this directive on July 25 that the main requirement for the success of the crossing was the surprise of the enemy.</body>\n",

The choice of the crossing point is therefore left to the high command and should not be limited by the reconnaissance of the Radomka estuary. The crossing should take place as soon as possible, without regard to any parts of the 9th Army that might be brought up.\n",
      "Although the crossing at Nowo Aleksandria had already begun on the night of July 25th upon receiving the new instructions, the left march of the three Landwehr divisions was immediately initiated: the Landwehr Corps was to reach the area Swierze Gorne—Glownaczow—Magnuszew by July 27th, and the Landwehr Division Bredow was to reach the area of Brzuzza by July 28th. Despite the extraordinarily long and strenuous marches required for this regrouping of all troops, especially those already deployed bridge trains at Nowo Aleksandria, all three Landwehr divisions were in the ordered accommodations by July 27th. After the relief of the Landwehr Corps, General von Kövesh took over with the Austro-Hungarian 7th Cavalry Division the Vistula security from south of Janowiec to Opatkowice and closed off the fortress Iwangorod with the Austro-Hungarian XII Corps from the west. The Austro-Hungarian 9th Cavalry Division maintained the river security between Kozienice and the Pilica, and it was immediately subordinated to the high command Woyrsch.\n",
      "Based on the reconnaissance results, Generaloberst von Woyrsch ordered the crossing for the night of July 28th to 29th between Swierze Gorne and Tarnow with the main focus at Ryczywol. However, on July 27th, the Russians attacked the cavalry stationed on the right flank of the German 9th Army north of the Pilica. Generaloberst von Woyrsch was thus faced with the serious question of whether to adhere to his decision for the Vistula crossing or to first turn north to support the 9th Army. The situation seemed not to be worrying, as it was already believed since July 24th that Russian attacks between Iwangorod and Warsaw had to be expected: 4½ Russian corps were at the Vistula crossing, and the Vistula crossings below the Pilica estuary were in Russian hands. Generaloberst von Woyrsch, however, remained firm in his decision, as he saw in his own river crossing the most effective countermeasure against an impending enemy offensive south of Warsaw. In the order issued on the morning of July 27th, he entrusted the leadership of the crossing to the commander of the Landwehr Corps, General of Cavalry Freiherr Herrn von König.</body>\n",

Although the Russians withdrew on this day on the southern flank of the Landwehr Corps to the heights east of Kruszyna, they continued to hold stubbornly on the heights southwest of Sobolew and Laskarzew at the eastern edge of the forest area. However, the Kövesz group succeeded in taking possession of the Russian position on the road Gniewoszów—Slowiki at the western front of Iwangorod. Towards evening, explosions and fires in Iwangorod seemed to indicate the evacuation of the fortress. During the night of August 4, the Russians indeed abandoned the western front of Iwangorod and withdrew to the east bank of the Vistula into the city and some outdated works, already abandoned in peacetime. Generaloberst von Bövich then ordered, on the instructions of the Austro-Hungarian High Command, the preparation of a division of the Kövesz group for crossing at Rozienice; at the same time, however, Generaloberst von Conrad, in agreement with General von Falkenhayn, ordered that the German 47th Reserve Division, in view of the \"changed situation at Iwangorod,\" should remain with the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army.\n",

In the center, too, it was possible to break into a height position southwest of Laskarzew and occupy Buczy. The Kövesz group, however, unsuccessfully attempted to gain the east bank at Iwangorod.

      "From the reconnaissance results regarding the Russian retreat, a clear picture emerged of a separation of their forces on the battlefields in Southern Poland and Eastern Galicia. The right wing of the Russian Southwestern Front (8th Army) was still at Sokal on the Bug. However, the left wing of the Northwestern Front (13th Army) had moved north towards Kowel. In the gap that formed between the two fronts, seven Russian cavalry divisions were supposed to be concentrated.\n",
      "In the following days, the ordered movements continued. The enemy withdrew in the area between the Bug and Vistula, partly under stubborn and skillful rearguard actions, further to a strong position recognized by aircraft in the line Uhruf (on the Bug)—Ostrow—course of the Tysmienica and the lower Wieprz. The armies advanced against this position fighting. Of decisive importance was a success on August 7th by the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, which led over Lubartow on the road to Kock to Firlej. This resolved the ordered crossing behind the 11th Army into the area beyond the Wieprz on August 4th. By its own strength, the right wing could now gain the eastern bank of the Wieprz on both sides of Lubartow. As a continuation of this success, on August 8th, the 4th Army reached its entire front to the lower Wieprz, thus advancing with its left wing into the fortress area of Iwangorod, which had meanwhile been vacated by the enemy. Also, between the Tysmienica and the Wieprz, the left wing of the 11th Army could advance accordingly on this day. By August 9th, the necessary movements were completed. It also moved closer to the enemy's position east of the Tysmienica under fighting. However, the left neighboring army could already advance the center and left wing beyond the Wieprz.\n",
      "This rapid advance of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army was related to the events that had meanwhile occurred on the front of Army Group Prince Leopold. Already on August 7th, intercepted radio messages had given the impression that the enemy, as before the left neighboring Army Gallwitz, as well as before the 9th Army, had continued the retreat, with the main forces already at Garwolin, Nowo-Minsk, and Stanislawow, and only weak rearguards at the Vistula.\n",

On the night of August 8, the 84th Infantry Division, the 49th Reserve Division, and the Gereke Division succeeded in gaining the eastern bank of the river at Warsaw with parts. Weak enemy forces withdrew eastward; construction of a military bridge in Warsaw began, over which the crossing started on the morning of August 9. Meanwhile, the enemy had been retreating since the night of August 8, where the Army Detachment Woyrsch was in retreat; it followed and reached the area of Stamin and northward on August 9, with the group Köves on the right wing extending beyond Rosfisch.\n",
      "On August 10, the k.-k. 4th Army, north of the Wieprz, in conjunction with the right wing of the Army Group Prince Leopold, continued its right turn over Koch and to the upper Bystrzyca. Also, before the Emmich Group of the 11th Army, the enemy voluntarily gave up the western bank of the Tysmienica. It then prepared for a flanking attack over the widely flooded lowlands of the river due to damming.\n",
      "The Bug Army, on the other hand, could make only slight progress in these days in difficult swamp terrain, especially against the elevated positions between the railway and road Cholm-Wlodawa north of the Ucherka, under heavy, loss-heavy attack battles. Already on August 6, General von Linsingen had attempted, in line with his earlier assessment of the strategic situation²), to effect a shift of forces to the right wing of the army at Field Marshal von Mackensen. He argued that the Russians could only be defeated by a \"quick and strong advance on both banks of the Bug or at least on the western bank.\" An advance of the left wing or the center of the armies operating between the Bug and Vistula would no longer hit the flank of the enemy retreat. Rather, the enemy would resist the relatively weak forces of the German right wing in strong positions immediately west of the Bug until the withdrawal of its main forces over this river section was completed. General von Linsingen, therefore, has to put the Bug Army in a position to force a breakthrough just west of the Bug as quickly as possible by reinforcing it with one or two army corps or by shortening its front.</body>\n",

This must first force the enemy, who has not yet been completely made to retreat, to withdraw and must reach his southern retreat flank as quickly as possible. I do not expect this speed of success from an advance on both sides of the Bug. Furthermore, the advance of the Bug Army through Borissow can be halted by enemy forces on our right flank. Securing the 11th and 4th Armies from such impact is the task of the Bug Army. If it also succeeds in advancing with considerable forces over Wlodawa, it will significantly support the operation of the 11th Army.\" The Chief of the General Staff, General von Seeckt, also expressed hope in a telephone conversation with General Lappen on August 6, that by continuing operations in the ordered directions, the enemy could be \"caught before Brest Litowsk.\"\n",

On August 10, he was forced to order the continuation of these movements to the line Osowiec—Biebrza—Giechanowiec—Drohiczyn—Miendzyrzec—Wlodawa, while the 13th Army east of the Bug had to withstand the pressure of an operational encirclement against the flank and rear of the shortened front and simultaneously maintain the connection to the Russian Southwest Front through cavalry.</body>\n",

On August 5, Colonel General v o n C o n r a d fundamentally agreed with this spatial objective but also expressed the view that the continued presence of the Russian front in Galicia, 40 kilometers from Lemberg, could not be tolerated in the long run, and indicated that he would either in connection with the current operation or following it, aim to advance his own front east of the Bug and in Galicia.\n",
      "A few days later, on August 8, he himself presented the German Supreme Army Command with a detailed proposal for the continuation of joint operations in the East. He maintained the previous strategic goal of thoroughly defeating the Russians in the Narew—Vistula—Wieprz—Wlodawa arc through concentric pressure from the northwest, west, and south. However, since the enemy was trying to escape encirclement by rapid retreat under stubborn resistance on his flanks, the Mackensen army group now had to take the general direction to the N o r t h e a s t towards Brest Litowsk, while the pressure of the Bug Army on the outermost flank would be reinforced by the addition of the German 47th Reserve Division. This time, however, there was no mention of this army crossing to the eastern bank, as Colonel General von Conrad had previously advised several times. It had to result inevitably from the change in direction of the army group to the northeast. Colonel General von Conrad also intended to have the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army advance in the direction of Rowel and to reinforce it further from the 4th Army¹). Parts of the Russian 13th Army apparently were in the process of being transported away from Rowel, while the Russian 8th Army was extending its front northwards along the Bug. Simultaneously with the 1st Army, he also wanted to have the 2nd and the Southern Army become offensive with their inner flanks against the line Bialykamien—Alczow—Zborow.\n",
      "The response from General von Falkenhayn on August 9 already revealed some uncertainty: In his view, the Mackensen army group would, in the course of the ongoing pursuit, naturally come into the desired direction to the northeast. However, he feared that issuing new instructions to them at this moment would cause an undesirable delay, while the utmost urgency was required.</body>\n",

Undoubtedly, his previously emphasized concern about the terrain difficulties of the Rokitno Marshes played a role here. He agreed to the other proposals and intentions with certain reservations. Generaloberst von Conrad immediately made a new representation: Only by a strong thrust of the right wing of the Mackensen Army Group could success still be achieved, which was all the more serious as the enemy was daily withdrawing more from the flank attack. A loss of time could not arise from a new directive, as the attack on the current Russian position was to be carried out first.\n",
      "Upon receiving the report on the morning of August 10 that the Russians were now also retreating in front of the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, Generaloberst von Conrad again turned to General von Falkenhayn with an urgent request to change the operational direction for the Mackensen Army Group, as otherwise not only the 4th, but also the 11th and Bug Army would come in front of the enemy, instead of into the flank. In a personal discussion, to which Generaloberst von Conrad traveled to Ples on the 10th, General von Falkenhayn, however, took the position that \"given the exhaustion of the troops and the terrain or supply difficulties, it was less important whether the 11th and Bug Army broke through, than that they succeeded at any point at all.\" When during this discussion the news arrived that the enemy was now also retreating from the left wing of the 11th Army, it was easy for Generaloberst von Conrad to demonstrate that the conditions for the thrust of the 11th Army in a northerly direction towards Parczew had thus become obsolete. General von Falkenhayn now agreed that the Mackensen Army Group was given the direction to the northeast towards Brest Litowsk. The 4th Army was to advance with its left wing over Radzyn to Biala, the 11th Army with its left wing over Parczew to Lomazy, and the Bug Army with its right wing in the river valley northward.\n",
      "Field Marshal von Mackensen then issued corresponding orders. He also ordered that the 4th Army should transfer an Austro-Hungarian division to the 1st Army and the German 47th Reserve Division to the 11th Army, which in turn was to transfer the 22nd Infantry Division of the Bug Army. The 1st Army received a double assignment depending on the behavior of the Russian 13th Army assembled in the area around Kowel.</body>\n",

If it advanced westward against the right flank of the Bug Army, it should itself be attacked on the flank by the 1st Army. If it directed its advance southwest against the 1st Army, then this had to fend it off at the Aug and Bug section, while the Bug Army could then find an opportunity to flank over the Bug. In the third case, if the Russian 13th Army did not become offensive at all, the 1st Army received no new instructions.\n",
      "The next task of the Mackensen Army Group was purely tactical: it was necessary to drive the enemy out of its non-opposing positions. However, the strength of the Bug Army was not sufficient on August 11 to break the resistance of the Russians in the strong elevated positions north of the Ucherka and in the marshy lowlands on both sides of the Garbatowka—Wlodawa road. Even the 11th Army achieved only insignificant partial successes east of the Tymienica despite brave efforts. A relief of this front by the intended flanking attack of the Emmich Group over the Tymienica did not occur, as it did not succeed in overcoming the marshy lowland. In front of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, however, the enemy surrendered the Bystrzyca above Ossowno without a fight.\n",

It was to continue the pursuit north of the Lutow—Brest Litowsk railway on the orders of the Supreme Army Command, \"to prevent a withdrawal of the enemy from the area west of the Pripjet marshes in a northeasterly direction\"¹). The 9th Army, extending with the left wing over Wengrow, encountered stubborn resistance at the Kortrzyn and Siwice sections.

The 11th Army, with its front narrowing, had strong units (XXII Reserve Corps, Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, X Army Corps, 47th Reserve Division) moved to the second line, but after passing through the forest zone ahead, it encountered the enemy again south of Parczem. The inner flanks of the 11th and 4th Armies still did not succeed in crossing the Lhynienica west of Parczem. The left flank of the 4th Army, however, swung completely to the east. The army was instructed to transfer two more divisions with the command of the Austro-Hungarian IX Corps to the 1st Army.\n",

Generaloberst von Conrad then ordered, beyond the agreements made in Plesk the day before, a rapid right turn against the Bug for the entire Mackensen Army Group in the sense of an overtaking pursuit. The Army High Command 11 now determined the boundaries for the advance of its army to the right as the line Piesia Wola—Süszno on the Bug (north of Wlodawa), and to the left as the line Parczew—Roznadawofka. Against this, General von Falkenhayn raised an objection the next morning at the Army Headquarters in Lublin, where he had gone for oral consultation with Field Marshal von Mackensen, and set, in accordance with the agreement of August 11, the line Parczew—Lomazy as the advance direction for the left flank of the 11th Army.

In a strong march, where the terrain and the enemy's road and bridge destructions often caused greater delays than the resistance of his rearguards, the three armies advancing west of the Bug reached the line Rozanka (north of Blodawa)—Rundo—area southwest of Miedzyrzec on August 13. Here, the right wing of Prince Leopold's army group joined, whose left wing approached the middle Bug south of the Nurzec estuary.\n",
      "The intention of Field Marshal von Mackensen was to let the Bug Army advance west of the river as far as Roden. The 11th Army was to reach the line Roden—Petrkowce on the railway to Brest Litowsk and probe towards the fortress. Thus, the Bug Army was assigned the area east of the Bug as a later operational field. For the s.e. 4th Army, there was no more room in the front of the two army groups. It could be excluded for other purposes.\n",
      "According to the findings of the pilots, the enemy moved north before the Bug and 11th Army, northeast before the 4th Army, and east before Prince Leopold's army group. General von Falkenhayn concluded that large troop masses had gathered in the area northwest of Brest Litowsk and hoped that with the sharp pursuit by the allied armies on all sides, it would be possible to engage large parts of the enemy retreating over the Bug still on this side of the Bialowieza forest in the area between the upper Narew and middle Bug, at least significantly disrupting their retreat. Based on this assessment, he sent the following directive in the evening: \"Army Group Mackensen is to secure against Brest Litowsk with the left wing of the 11th Army from Lomazy via Biala to Janow. Operations against the roads leading east from Brest Litowsk are recommended.\" Prince Leopold's army group was deployed with the right wing from Mienowce to Niemirow on the Bug, with the Frommel Cavalry Corps in the general direction of Klejsczele.

      "<body>South of Biala, the 4th Army subsequently reached westward up to and over the Krzna River. The right wing of the Prince Leopold Army Group stood about 14 kilometers north of Niemirowce. \"The Russian withdrawal routes made a very orderly impression; nothing was discarded; no broken wagon, no dead horse lay on the road\"¹). However, along the entire wide-ranging pursuit front, the bridges, villages, and harvest supplies set on fire by the enemy were in flames. Explosions were audible from the direction of Brest Litowsk.\n",
      "In view of the rapidly progressing retreat movement of the Russians on the entire front of all three army groups, General von Falkenhayn now deemed it necessary to point out to the Mackensen Army Group the increased importance of a strong pressure along the Bug. At the same time, the Commander-in-Chief East was designated Klejsczale as the direction for the advance of the right wing of the 12th Army²). The Prince Leopold Army Group was also to advance ruthlessly over the middle Bug.\n",
      "Field Marshal von Mackensen therefore ordered the Bug Army, in conjunction with the Guard Corps advancing on the right wing of the 11th Army, to drive the enemy back to the fortress of Brest Litowsk. The Austro-Hungarian VI Corps was to take over the security against Brest Litowsk to the left of the Guard, and the left army wing (Kosch Corps) was to advance over Biala and drive the enemy back across the Bug below the fortress.\n",
      "On August 16, the enemy continued the retreat on both banks of the Bug northward. Intercepted Russian radio messages already reported heavy congestion at the crossings. To protect its withdrawal on the east bank, the enemy hurriedly deployed troops brought in by motor vehicles against the bridgehead created the day before at Wlodawa and prevented the attempt to expand the bridgehead as a starting position for offensive operations through strong counterattacks. On the west bank, strong parts of the Bug Army swung north from Slawatycze into the area south of Koden against the river. The 11th Army pushed its right wing to the Bug at Koden.\n",

      "The allied military commands established the Niemirow–Tumin line as the boundary between the two army groups on August 16. The Mackensen army group was to continue the pursuit with its left wing in conjunction with the Prince Leopold army group, and in addition, initially encircle the Brest Litowsk fortress on this side, and later also on the northwest front on the opposite Bug bank. Furthermore, General von Falkenhayn decided, upon inquiry from General von Seeckt, that larger operations by the Bug Army on the eastern bank were not desirable in terms of the general situation. He justified this by stating: \"The enemy is not retreating voluntarily, but heavily beaten, although in an extraordinarily skillful manner. Nevertheless, it is possible that he is still considering a reversal of the situation through a counterattack similar to the Marne Offensive. Given the condition of his 12th, 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 3rd Armies, he could mainly rely on the 13th Army, now in the northern march through the western Polesie1). However, its intervention would hardly lead to the hoped-for results. It is necessary for the Mackensen army group to strengthen its positions along the Bug above Brest Litowsk and later in front of the fortress, creating the possibility to move freed forces as a reserve behind the right wing of the units continuing the thrust past the fortress over the Bug. These must be made as strong as possible to attack relentlessly.\" General von Falkenhayn also shared the agreement reached with Generaloberst von Conrad at the beginning of August2), that the continuation of the pursuit operation beyond the general line Brest Litowsk–Grodno was not intended at the time, unless there was a prospect of inflicting significant damage on the enemy through a short advance beyond this line. Smaller operations over the Bug above Brest Litowsk against the connections leading east were recommended. On the other hand, \"measures of a larger scale in this direction were outside the scope of the overall operation.\" The Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army thus decided once again in the spirit of the operational idea that had guided him from the beginning of the offensive.\n",
      "Field Marshal von Mackensen pointed out the need for the Bug Army and 11th Army to strongly expand their encirclement positions and decided to move the X Army Corps, which had been deployed as a security at the Bug, behind the left wing of the 11th Army.\n",

      "By carrying out the ordered relief movements, on August 17, the left wing of the Bug Army and the 11th Army were able to swing to the right into the line north of Roden–Janow. The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army reached the Bug southeast of Niemirow in a narrow space, where it joined the Prince Leopold Army Group. On the opposite bank, the enemy was entrenched. The main road from Brest Litowsk to Kobryn was covered with marching columns of all arms. According to agent reports, the Russian leadership intended to hold the fortress as long as it could be used for the retreat of the field army. There was a lack of ammunition for prolonged defense. However, strong forces had to be concentrated in a confined space in the fortress itself. Since a new general command (XXXIV) was also detected in front of Brest Litowsk by eavesdropping, the Mackensen High Command, following the advice of General von Falkenhayn, considered the possibility of an advance from the fortress and prepared against the Guard Corps as well as the 103rd and 119th Infantry Divisions behind the right wing of the 11th Army. Since the Supreme Army Command was already considering the imminent attack on the fortress, Field Marshal von Mackensen tasked the Bug Army with encircling the south and west fronts and soon with the attack, and also subordinated to it the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps now standing on the right wing of the 11th Army.\n",
      "The retreat of the Russians east of the Bug continued. Consequently, Field Marshal von Mackensen believed, within the framework of the instructions given to him, that he should now attempt to cut the communication line of the Russian 13th and 8th Armies and thus also that from Brest Litowsk to the southeast by an advance of the Cavalry Corps Heydebreck) from Wladimir Wolynsk on and over the railway junction Kowel. The Austro-Hungarian 1st Army received corresponding orders. Generaloberst von Conrad still attached great importance to the early capture of Kowel for other reasons. Already on August 14, he had expressed to General von Falkenhayn in Teschen, based on his previously indicated plans, the intention to gradually unite the 4th Army, which had been largely pushed out of the front of the Mackensen Army Group, with the 1st Army on the Bug front and to initially direct both armies from there towards Kowel to lead them forward.</body>\n",

      "Indeed, on August 20, the Russian 4th Army (XVI, Grenadier, XXV, XV, VI Siberian, IX Corps) swung back into the line Kleszczele—Wysoko Litowsk—east of Drogniki, followed by the 3rd Army (XXIV, X, XIV, III Caucasian, XXIX, XXIII, XXXI Corps, 4th Cavalry Corps) on this side of the Bug reached the line east of Drogniki—Koden, beyond the river it held the extended line Koden—Sack—Kursk—Wladyslawow (east of Wladimir Wolynsk). The Russian 13th Army had been dissolved on August 17. Its troops were assigned to the 3rd Army, as far as they were not transported to other fronts. The fortress Brest Litowsk was also subordinated to this. The Russian leadership was evidently aware of the serious danger that the execution of their retreat movement from a pressure of the enemy on the right Bug bank east past Brest Litowsk had to grow. Therefore, they provided for the strongest defense there.\n",
      "As a result, on August 20 and 21, the Bug Army also failed to advance to the road Luboml—Piszca, although the entire XXXI Reserve Corps from the south sought to encircle through the lake district and the 22nd Infantry Division intervened on the left next to the 1st. Only on August 22 did the XXXI Reserve Corps advance over this road to Mielniki. Simultaneously heavily attacked in the front, the enemy finally also released Piszca and the area north of it. Although General von Linsingen reinforced his forces east of the Bug with the Gerok Corps (11th Bavarian and the 107th Infantry Division), the stubborn enemy could only be pushed back a few kilometers in the difficult forest and swamp terrain in the following days. Behind strong barrier positions, his main forces continued to flow to Kobryn.\n",
      "On August 24, the Heydebreck Cavalry Corps, after days of fighting, took possession of the railway junction Kowell and advanced from there in a northerly direction to Ratno. It now came under the command of the Bug Army's high command. Parts of the b. u. l. Army had already followed the Cavalry Corps to Kowell in recent days. The army, further strengthened by detachments from the 4th Army, was already regrouping for the offensive ordered to the southeast. On August 22, the entry of Generaloberst von Conrad from the command area of the army group command was planned.\n",

On August 22, he instructed his corps not to wait for the decisive attack until the siege artillery, expected to be ready for fire at the earliest on August 28 and 29, had arrived. The following days were spent preparing for a coup de main attack.\n",
      "As a result, significant progress was initially made only north of the Krzna stream on the front of Army Group Mackensen west of the Bug. Here, the 11th Army reached the Bug as early as August 21, its left wing (Corps Kosch) pushed beyond it to the Nareka section, where it became involved in heavy fighting. In the following days, the 44th Reserve Division from the south and the 103rd Infantry and 47th Reserve Divisions from the north, as well as rear parts of the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, joined in, without achieving the intended encirclement of the enemy. It seemed that the Russians had brought artillery from the fortress with ample ammunition to support their defense. Only when the Guard Corps also advanced over the Bug below the Krzna mouth on August 24 did the enemy shift to a west-facing front.\n",
      "On this day, the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army reached the area south of Ruski with its left wing in close connection with the Army Detachment Woyrsch, the northern wing of the 9th Army over Kleszczele to the western edge of the Bialowiec forest. In serious fighting in the source area of the Nurec on August 22 and 23, the German Landwehr Corps, the Landwehr Division Bredow, and the Corps Scheffer were again able to report larger numbers of prisoners, totaling around 10,000 men and 25 machine guns. Already on the evening of August 23, the Supreme Army Command had informed the High Command of Army Group Prince Leopold that it was not intended to follow the left wing further than to the western edge of the Bialowiec forest. It would be of great importance to block there only with weak parts, but to advance as quickly as possible with strong forces south of the forest, in order to then operate in a general southern direction against the retreat route of the enemy still in front of the Austro-Hungarian 4th and German 11th Army.</body>\n",

      "The Mackensen Army Group, despite all attempts to intercept the Russian retreat movement on the flank, had ended up in front of their line. Continuing the attack against the Leina position, where sustained resistance was expected, could only push the enemy back in the direction they themselves desired, to the east. A change in this operationally unsatisfactory situation could only be hoped for if the Bug Army succeeded in quickly capturing the fortress of Brest Litowsk and simultaneously breaking the enemy's resistance with their forces deployed in the forest and swamp area east of the Bug. General von Seeckt, however, no longer expected any great success from the flanking action south of Brest Litowsk in an assessment of the situation submitted to the Supreme Army Command on the evening of August 24. Indeed, on August 25, the enemy strongly resisted the pressure of the Bug Army at Maloruta and northwest to the Bug. The Heydebreck Cavalry Corps was still far behind. However, on the evening of the same day, the o.u. VI Corps succeeded in capturing several forts on both sides of the road to Brest Litowsk with a storming hand. In front of the right wing of the northern adjoining XXII Reserve Corps, the enemy retreated south of the Krzna to their positions in the fortress area. On the northern Bug bank, the left wing of the XXII Reserve Corps swung over the lower Lesna to the right, while the other corps of the 11th Army pushed the enemy back behind this section, and the o.u. 4th Army reached as far as Rusilow with its left wing.\n",
      "In the area of the fortress, strong firelight and numerous explosions were observed. The marches out of the fortress to Kobryn continued. In the evening, intercepted enemy radio messages arrived at Mackensen's headquarters, indicating that the Russians would also evacuate the Leina position at night. Similarly, the retreat was to begin at 2 a.m. in front of the Bug Army. Consequently, Field Marshal von Mackensen ordered the uninterrupted continuation of the pursuit by the Bug Army south and the 11th Army north of the Brest Litowsk—Kobryn road at 10 p.m. General von Falkenhayn also emphasized late at night the great importance of a rapid breakthrough north and south around Brest Litowsk. At the same time, the Prince Leopold Army Group received orders to continue the offensive south of the Bialowiec fort with the Woyrsch Army Detachment, while the left wing of the 9th Army was also to take over the blockade of the fort on the Gajnowka—Siemienowka railway.</body>\n",

      "Already in the early morning hours of August 26, the right wing of the Bug Army, the XXXXI Reserve Corps and the 22nd Infantry Division, crossed the railway on both sides of Maloruta and pursued the enemy retreating towards Kobryn, who, however, offered strong resistance in the segmented terrain. The right wing reached Motrany after a hard fight and blocked the enemy, pushed back northwards through the swamps by the Heydebreck Cavalry Corps from the south, from retreating northwards. It was pushed southwards. The Cavalry Corps reached Ratno. Under the pressure of the right wing of the Bug Army on the road to Kobryn, the Russians also evacuated the forest area west of the Bug, abandoning the heavily fortified Brest Litowsk fortress. Without serious fighting, the Beskiden Corps and the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps were able to occupy the southern part of the fortress and cross the Bug in the early morning hours. The VI Corps was then assembled and returned to the 11th Army. The XXII Reserve Corps had already occupied the citadel between 2 and 3 in the morning; the forts were mostly blown up by the enemy. The Bug Army was instructed to advance sharply with its left wing on and south of the road to Kobryn, in conjunction with the parts of the 11th Army pursuing further north over the Leśna to the east, to relocate the forces of the enemy, who were still holding out in the swamp sections on both sides of the Wlodawa—Kobryn road, from this beautiful marshy terrain. The Bug Army then reached the Ryta section. The 11th Army followed the enemy retreating east of the Leśna under rear-guard fighting to the line Raczkī (on the railway)—Kamieniec Litowsk.\n",
      "The Austro-Hungarian 4th Army occupied a bridgehead east of Kamieniec Litowsk after crossing the Leśna.

Then the rest of the 4th Army, as well as the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, had to march to the 1st Army.\n",
      "Upon the report of the capture of Brest Litowsk, the Supreme Army Command determined on the evening of August 26 that the Leśna would be the boundary between the Mackensen and Leopold army groups.

      "<body>Thus, August 26 had brought the Mackensen Army Group an outwardly great success, the capture of Brest Litowsk, one of the most heavily fortified Russian fortresses! At the same time, however, it had become apparent that the hope cherished by General von Falkenhayn until the end, to cut off significant parts of the enemy, had been thwarted. The Russian retreat had been carried out according to plan under skillfully conducted rearguard actions. The evacuation of Brest Litowsk had been thoroughly prepared. The forts were blown up, the magazines and the city abandoned by the population were mostly set on fire. Considerable supplies could still be saved from destruction. However, only small ammunition stocks fell into the hands of the attacker. All modern artillery material was transported away, only a few old guns formed the booty. Despite the concentration of strong troop masses in the fortress area, the number of prisoners was also small. Aerial reconnaissance revealed that the withdrawal of the enemy marching columns on the roads over Kobryn and Pruzana to the east and northeast remained in constant flow. The main mass of the southern wing of the Russian Northwest Front was thus moving north of the Rokitno swamp area. The connection to the Russian Southwest Front was thus finally cut off. Only the Russian 4th Cavalry Corps remained south of the swamp area in the region of Kamien Koszyrski. It had, as determined by intercepting radio messages, the task of blocking the roads leading from there north through the Rokitno swamps. Characteristic of the confident mood with which the higher Russian leadership, despite all tactical setbacks, looked forward to the outcome of their strategic retreat, was an intercepted radio telegraphic call from General Ewert, the leader of the 4th Army. In it, the plan for the breakout was given, that the troops would disengage from close contact with the enemy with honor. Added was: \"May they remember the great war of 1812 and draw from it instruction and the deep belief in our ultimate victory.\" Indeed, the traditional skill of the Russians in conducting the retreat, supported by the sloping terrain, proved effective once again. Although the operations of the Mackensen Army Group, which alone cost the Bug Army about 33,000 men and the 11th Army over 50,000 men in losses, had failed to achieve the desired operational success, they had still managed to, apart from causing significantly heavier bloody losses and prisoner losses to the enemy, deeply shake their combat power and deprive them of any offensive capability for a long time.</body>\n",

In addition, the moral impact that the quick fall of Brest Litowsk had on both friend and foe was not to be underestimated.

      "8. Considerations.\n",
      "In view of the operationally not fully satisfactory result that the offensive of the Mackensen Army Group had from mid-July to the end of August, the question arises whether a greater, decisive success could have been achieved with different leadership of the operation. One would have to consider the possibility of using strong forces on the east bank of the Bug for the purpose of an operational encirclement of the Russian defense front directed southwards and a thrust against their rear connections. This idea was not only discussed in the fundamental meeting of the allied general staffs on July 11 in Ples²) before the start of the offensive, but also repeatedly during its course. General von Falkenhayn opposed it from the outset, considering the unfavorable terrain east of the Bug and the expected supply difficulties, and steadfastly maintained this view until the end. His concerns about the possibility of deploying larger troop masses in those areas were not shared, at least not to the same extent, by his colleagues³), nor by Generaloberst von Conrad and General von Linsingen. They later admitted that General von Falkenhayn's concerns were exaggerated. For supply, the conditions east of the Bug might have been less unfavorable than west of the river, as the Galician railways there were disrupted by the Russians in the autumn of 1914 with the construction of the Wladimir Wolynsk—Sokal connection to the Russian railway network.\n",

      "<body>In 1914, the connection route Wladimir Wolynsk—Sokal had a link to the Russian railway network. The head of the German military railway system therefore already considered the deployment of a strong army east of the Bug at the beginning of July to be feasible and necessary.\n",
      "That it would have been possible to create the conditions for simultaneous operations on both banks of the river by regrouping forces on a large scale and by exchanging the approaching s.-u. 1st Army with the Bug Army, which was in the process of formation, before the opening of the new offensive, is not to be disputed. Apparently, this idea was not considered by the connecting General Staffs at that time, because the difficulties of the upcoming task only gradually became apparent from the increasingly solidified, eventually even openly conducted resistance of the Russians in the area between the Bug and the Vistula in the first week of July. When, on July 11, the question of using stronger forces on the east bank was discussed for the first time in Plesz, it was already too late for such extensive and time-consuming regrouping of forces before the start of the offensive, as the timing for this could no longer be postponed in view of the simultaneously planned Narew operation. Consequently, in the initial situation in mid-July, as it had developed due to the course of events in the first half of the month, the prerequisites for a far-reaching offensive of strong forces on the east bank of the Bug were lacking. The weak attempt to change banks, which the s.-u. 1st Army then made in the first days of the operation, also served merely to protect the right flank of the army group against possible attacks by the Russians from the east. When these did not occur, Field Marshal von Mackensen immediately abandoned the continuation of the attempt.\n",
      "Certainly, even after the start of the offensive, the shifting of stronger forces of the Bug Army to the east bank was still possible. They could have exerted increased offensive pressure there together with parts of the s.-u. 1st Army. However, it was not to be assumed that they would find easier work there against the Russian 13th Army than west of the river. A complete encirclement of the outer flank of the Russian Northwest Front seemed hardly to be hoped for. Rather, there was a danger that the forces predicted east of the Bug could become entangled in barely manageable battles and could easily be diverted in an eccentric direction from the main decision-making site. That these already in view of the need for the closest possible cooperation with the Narew assault group in the area between the Bug and the Vistula should be sought was in line with the guiding idea.</body>\n",

      "The aim was to seek the closest possible cooperation with the Narew strike group in the area between the Bug and Vistula, in line with the guiding idea. Field Marshal von Mackensen therefore had the justified desire, and after the course of the first heavy days of fighting even more reason, to keep his forces as concentrated as possible in this area. As long as the enemy seemed determined not only to defend to the utmost but also to fight a decisive battle in Poland — this impression persisted, aside from temporary fluctuations, until the end of July — the leader of the army group saw the extension of his right wing beyond the Bug to the east as an impairment of his striking power at the decisive point. He welcomed the fact that the strong river obstacle provided effective protection against an offensive threat to the right flank of the army, and consequently, the number of troops required for security purposes could be kept within tolerable limits.\n",
      "Thus, until the end of July, it was primarily tactical reasons that made the concentration of the strongest possible forces necessary to achieve victory at the main battlefront. From the beginning of August, as the large, apparently uniformly planned retreat movement of the entire Russian forces in Poland began to become clearly visible, operational considerations suggested the crossing of strong forces to the eastern bank of the Bug. Colonel General von Conrad and independently of him, General von Linsingen, advocated this idea in the sense of a pursuit aimed northwards against the retreat routes of the Russians, overtaking them laterally. In contrast, Field Marshal von Mackensen, in agreement with General von Falkenhayn, insisted on continuing the operation in a generally northern direction on this side of the Bug, with the strategic overall picture in mind. He hoped to advance more quickly with the 11th Army, made the main carrier of the pursuit, on a shorter route in more favorable terrain and thus exert more effective pressure against the retreat routes of the Russians than seemed possible in the feared swampy terrain beyond the Bug, where stronger enemy resistance was expected. This calculation proved to be quite correct, as the Russian retreat from Poland had already progressed further than the German leadership had dared to assume. Instead of hitting the flank, the pursuer ended up in front of the front. It remains to be seen whether a pursuit conducted with strong forces south past Brest Litowsk towards the northeast would have achieved significantly greater material successes. The determined resistance, which parts of the Bug Army encountered there from mid-August onwards after their crossing at Wlodawa, even suggests that it would have been very difficult to quickly achieve direct impact against the retreat area of the main Russian forces north of the swamp area.\n",

Nevertheless, from a retrospective point of view, the possibility cannot be dismissed that an earlier and stronger flanking pressure here would have strategically threatened the Russian retreat movement more significantly. This would have more severely disrupted the orderly and planned execution of this retreat movement, particularly the evacuation of the fortress Brest Litowsk, and thus could have shaken the combat strength of the Russian army even more than the frontal pursuit managed to do.\n",
      "The question of using strong forces east of the Bug would be fundamentally different under the assumption of a simultaneous offensive directed not against the Narew from the front of the Commander-in-Chief East, but on and over Vilna against the northern flank of the main Russian forces. In such a case, it would have corresponded to the idea of concentrated cooperation against the rear connections of the enemy masses standing in Poland if the Mackensen Army Group had already placed the focus of its operations in the area east of the Bug from mid-July.</body>\n",

      "Since Gorlice, the Russian Supreme Command was primarily focused on defense. It hoped for relief through the offensive begun by the Western Powers on May 9²) and the entry of Italy, soon Romania, perhaps even Bulgaria into the war. On the other hand, it was concerned whether it would actually succeed in halting the advance of the Central Powers in Galicia. Both were interrelated: successful defense in Galicia had to promote the acquisition of new allies, whose intervention would also bring relief for the situation in Galicia. Besides domestic and economic considerations, foreign policy concerns also argued for a stubborn fight for every inch of ground, while purely militarily the idea was to maintain the army's striking power and therefore to retreat into the vastness of the empire as needed without regard to land loss. The duality of these viewpoints played a decisive role in the measures of the Russian leadership alongside the impact of the Central Powers' offensive.\n",

The Supreme Command, as before, with Grand Duke Nicholas as General Staff Chief and General Janushkevich as General Quartermaster, was located in Baranovichi.

      "Behind the front lines, apart from the breakthrough front in Galicia and southern Poland and the area north of the Njemen, which were quite strongly developed, in Poland from south of Iwangorod via Nowogeorgiewsk to near Lomza, deeply staggered rear positions and behind them the Narew-Vistula line, reinforced by fortifications, offered stubborn resistance. However, if the pressure from the opponents unexpectedly forced the abandonment of this \"forward theater of war,\" the large rear main defense line of the Njemen and Bug with the strong and modernized fortresses of Kowno, Grodno, and Brest was still available. Its right flank seemed sufficiently protected by the absence of railways and roads north of the Njemen, while the left wing found secure support behind the Dniester at the Romanian border. This last position was hoped to be held even under the most unfavorable developments.\n",
      "Since the beginning of May, the focus of the Supreme Command had been captivated by the situation at the front in Galicia. Information about the German troop distribution was generally quickly and well informed, presumably through agent reports and prisoner statements. The German advance north of the Njemen was not considered significant, as the forces identified there were too weak to pose a threat. Thus, the Northwest Front had meanwhile become the source of strength, nourished by troop transfers for the heavy and costly battle of the Southwest Front. Here, around mid-May, the pressure against the section that had previously felt it most strongly, against the 3rd Army, which stood below the fortress of Przemysl on the San, seemed to have eased, and it was believed that the German troops were moving more southward. On May 17, the Grand Duke personally wired General Brussilow, the commander of the 8th Army, expressing special confidence in his tactics and was convinced that he would not only hold Przemysl, whose possession was particularly important, but also strengthen the overall situation through active combat leadership on his remaining front. He suggested to the Southwest Front to consider forming a new operational army from their reserves in the area north of Lemberg, to which the three divisions strong army reserve and from the Northwest Front a particularly proven army leader, General Plehwe, previously commander of the 12th Army, should be assigned one and a half corps. However, the commander of the Northwest Front reported that if he were to lead such a transfer, he needed to know whether he should continue to hold his current front or be allowed to give up the Grojec position covering the Narew and Warsaw.\n",

      "<body>As the enemy at the San did not advance further on May 20, the Russian military leadership saw the situation as more favorable again, with the imminent intervention of Italy likely playing a decisive role. A military convention had already been concluded with it on April 26, through which both powers committed to deploying the maximum of their forces in the direction of Vienna-Budapest for a decisive blow against the Danube Monarchy and to manage with a minimum on the other fronts. Serbia was to participate by seeking contact in a northwesterly direction on the Italian right wing near Laibach. In view of these plans, the start of the retreat from the San was postponed. General Ivanov intended to prepare a larger offensive operation; General Alexeyev now proposed an even larger one, aiming to attack in the West and thus restore the situation in Galicia. The Grand Duke explained to the commanders of the Western powers on May 23 that at least ten newly deployed German divisions were already fighting against Russia; this indeed complicated their task, but \"in the context of the overall situation, it was just timely to facilitate the expansion of the successes already achieved in the West\"(2). When the state of war was declared on the Italian front on May 24, General Joffre was to send a telegram of admiration for Russian heroism and expected \"the most brilliant results from Italy's entry into the war.\" The Russian military leadership believed, as on the same day the attack of the Central Powers at the San continued, only in a final effort by the enemy to end the operation by capturing Przemysl and then turn against Italy. They ordered that the fortress should only be evacuated when all means were exhausted, and had the 4th Army of the Southwest Front move to the Northwest Front so that General Ivanov could focus all his attention on the defense in Galicia. However, the formation of a new operational army north of Lemberg had meanwhile proven impractical.\n",
      "It soon became apparent that the new ally, contrary to its initial intentions, was not yet ready for the offensive, and its deployment would extend well into June(3).

On June 5, the Chief of General Staff, General Januschkewitsch, wrote to the Minister of War): \"After the Germans have brought about an unprecedented collapse on the Southwestern front, they will now apparently turn to the Northwestern front\"; the question was only whether against Warsaw or Riga. Reinforcing the Northwestern front was not easy, because since May 9, against 18 divisions), i.e., about 200 battalions, had been thrown to the Southwestern front. The result of their intervention was \"virtually zero,\" the complete corps and divisions had \"melted away like snow.\"\n",
      "While Warsaw was somewhat secured by the armies and fortifications standing before it, Riga, which was more important for the supply of the army due to its large industry than Warsaw, was virtually unprotected; open to enemy access. A panic had broken out in the city; people began to remove money, supplies, and machines, so that the threat alone already hampered the production of army supplies). In Petersburg, there was concern. Since the commander-in-chief of the Northwestern front did not yet expect far-reaching German operations north of the Njemen, the Supreme Command retained the leadership of the previous Riga—Schavli—Group, which became the \"5th Army,\" to be transferred to General Plehwe and as the only available reinforcement at the time, to move divisions with only 3000 men each (combat strength¹) to Riga until they could be replenished.</body>\n",

The new 5th Army was to protect the route to Petersburg in the future, together with the Baltic Fleet. Admiral Kanin, who had taken over command from the now deceased Admiral von Essen, relied on the naval ports in the Gulf of Finland; in the open Baltic Sea and in the Gulf of Riga, he had almost only light forces, mainly minelayers and submarines. The 5th Army was detached from the rest of the front due to its special task; its rear connections led northeast to Riga. This gave the fortress of Kowno increased importance as the right wing support point of the main front and was therefore directly subordinated to the Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest Front, its garrison reinforced. All troops west of the lower Vistula to the Pilica were combined as the 2nd Army, eliminating the previous 5th Army.\n",
      "Regarding the overall situation of the Northwest Front, General Alexeyev wrote to the Chief of the General Staff on June 5: The decisive factor was that it was \"stretched to a thin thread\" without reserves. After twelve divisions for the Southwest Front and seven for the area north of the Njemen³) had been withdrawn recently, the front garrison was so weakened that the enemy could break through even the strongest fortified positions after thorough artillery preparation. Therefore, the only option was to shorten the front by retreating behind the Narew and into the Grojec position; then up to four corps could be spared as reserves. The aim was to preserve the combat strength of the armies, considerations of the moral impact of retreating had to take a back seat. However, there was no time to lose, so as not to be attacked in the current extended positions. Once the regrouping was completed, an attack could be considered again. The Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Front viewed the situation differently. When General Januschkewitsch suggested to him on June 6 to gradually gain rear positions to preserve the Seesaw, in order to fight the great battle at the Gnila Lipa, General Ivanov wanted nothing to do with it. He replied, the task was, despite the most difficult circumstances, to defend every inch of land; \"the Emperor, Russia, and the Grand Duke demand from us stubborn resistance...

      "On the same day, the Grand Duke reported to the Tsar that the shortfall now amounted to 300,000 men on the Southwestern Front and 100,000 men on the Northwestern Front, but for the incoming replacements, weapons were lacking, \"thus every strategy ends.\" The training level of the replacements, who had barely learned to shoot due to the lack of rifles, was beyond criticism; there was a lack of officers. \"We cannot seize the initiative again, but must limit ourselves to repelling the enemy's blows ...

      "On June 17, in a meeting with the commanders of the army groups in Cholm, defense was set as the task for the near future to restore the army's combat strength and later to resume the offensive. The northwestern front was to consider the middle Njemen, the Bobr, the Narew, and the Vistula up to Iwangorod inclusive as the main line of defense. Forward of this line, the front could be shortened if necessary, but Warsaw was to be held \"to the utmost.\" The southwestern front, whose right wing (3rd Army) was still north of the lower San, could, in view of the sharp German pressure towards Lemberg, withdraw southwards to Lublin-Cholm up to the Reich border, but should delay the enemy by exploiting every available terrain section. To strengthen this front, extreme measures were taken; their infantry was to immediately receive 30 men suitable for non-commissioned officers \"with rifles\" from each cavalry regiment of the entire army, 100,000 replacement troops \"with rifles,\" and the entire remaining rifle stock of 40,000 pieces. An additional 150,000 rifles were hoped to be freed in the coming months by equipping the replacement battalions with Japanese weapons; the factories produced about 45,000 pieces monthly.

When the 8th Army then saw itself forced to evacuate Lemberg itself the following night, the \"thorough evacuation\" of the Galician capital and the entire still-occupied part of Galicia was ordered. The loss of Lemberg on June 22 was a particularly severe blow to Russia's prestige. The situation had escalated to the point where major decisions had to be made.

He hoped that the pressure from the allies would eventually bring relief and that the \"regularity\" of the impending Serbian and German advance would set a goal. It was about gaining time, with the \"numerical area\" of Russia offering great possibilities. And yet, in the future, no step of Russian soil should be surrendered to the enemy without compelling necessity. If it was not possible to remain further west, then the defense in the Njemen—Bug line was the most promising. It had to extend from Riga to the Romanian border, about 1000 kilometers, and had positioned itself behind this railway cross-connection Riga—Wilna—Baranowicze—Rowno—Kameniec Podolsk, with numerous branches to the west and east. Those favorable defense lines had already been almost reached by the outer army wings in retreat, while the center still had to advance. It was necessary to lead them out of threatening encirclement if needed. Therefore, it was desirable to place them under unified command.

      "When in the last days of June and the first days of July, the new left wing of the Northwest Front and especially the right of the Southwest Front had to further yield to the pressure of the Central Powers, General Alexeyev wanted to continue stubborn resistance south of the Lublin—Cholm line, where the enemy seemed to be directing the main thrust; he also prepared for the possibility of a German attack in the most sensitive direction, from East Prussia via Ostrowiec. On July 4, he ordered the 2nd Army, most exposed in West Poland, to close the deployed fortress areas on the night of July 7 and to retreat to the Blonie—Grojec position; the 4th Army to the south and the 12th and 1st Armies on the Narew Front were also to join the movement. However, the execution was halted again, the timing left open; preparations for the evacuation of Warsaw had begun.\n",
      "At the request of General Alexeyev, the Grand Duke himself came to Siedlce on July 5 and gave him free rein through an order stating: The enemy, who was apparently only conducting a feint operation north of the Njemen, threatened the entire situation on the front theater of war with the attack on Lublin—Cholm. If it was not possible to stop this attack, General Alexeyev was to continue to evade, \"to preserve the living strength of the army for the long-lasting war.\" Meanwhile, in the south, the abandonment of the Bug Line was already being considered, with the front Lomza—Malkin—Lutow—Ratno, 75 kilometers southeast of Brest Litowsk on the upper Pripet, being considered as the next line of resistance; the extreme limit for the retreat was initially to be the line Bobr—upper Narew—Brest Litowsk—Ratno. Thus, the Southwest Front was henceforth assigned the front between the Rokitno Marshes and the Romanian border. Ivangorod, Warsaw, and Nowo-Georgiewsk were not to be defended as fortresses but evacuated as parts of the field positions with these. The Grand Duke could not bring himself to order the same for the large and strong fortress of Nowogeorgiewsk; this place, which covered Warsaw, was to be held and defended to the utmost; the impossibility of finally depriving it of the already overloaded railways leading east from Warsaw had decisively influenced this decision. Meanwhile, the Grand Duke hoped to be able to postpone the retreat further. On the 10th, the Russian attack began, perhaps the German striking power would still falter.\n",

      "Due to the success of the large German attack against the Narew Front starting on July 13<sup>4)</sup>, General Alexeyev was forced to order his 2nd Army to execute the retreat to the Blonie—Grojec position; the movements began on the night of July 17.

      "On the night of July 21, following the retreating 4th Army on the northern flank of the 2nd Army, the Grojec position was abandoned, and on the 22nd, General Alexeyev ordered the southern flank (4th, 3rd, and 13th Army) to gradually retreat to the Ivangorod—Kovel line. The following days brought the fall of the Narew line Pultusk—Lomza. At the same time, the pressure of the new German attacks in Lithuania and Courland began to take effect, which now already threatened the road to Vilna. On July 24, Prince Kudachev, the representative of the Foreign Minister at the headquarters, reported to Petersburg that General Yanushkevich had told him, \"taking a deep breath,\" that \"we must drink the cup to the dregs\" and, pointing to the Riga—Schaulem front, said: \"If the Germans continue to attack there, we must evacuate Warsaw and — retreat.\"\n",
      "General Alexeyev did not yet consider the situation on the extreme northern flank to be threatening. As he reported to the Grand Duke during another meeting in Siedlce on July 28, the German forces deployed there were too weak for a major operation, and new decisions were not yet necessary. General Danilov accordingly attached \"overriding importance\" to the front north of the Njemen, and the Grand Duke ordered the immediate reinforcement of the 5th Army fighting there with two infantry and one cavalry division from the southwestern front. However, he left the timing for the evacuation of the Vistula line to General Alexeyev as before. The events on the Narew front were now considered decisive for the fate of Warsaw, as a German breakthrough towards Wyszkow on the Bug could severely complicate the retreat of the Russian troops still standing on the Vistula. At the Lublin—Cholm front, it was believed that they could hold at this time, and an attack at this point was considered less threatening.\n",
      "The surprising Vistula crossing by the Woyrsch Army Detachment on the night of July 29 between Warsaw and Ivangorod brought new concerns.

      "<body>10th Army expressed concern about Swenzjany, where the Germans could unexpectedly strengthen quickly. This would force an immediate weakening of the Vistula front, whose evacuation had not yet been ordered at that time. The 5th Army was therefore to shift its focus more to the south, in the area of Dünaburg. On August 9, the Southwestern Front was again ordered to transfer two divisions to the 5th Army. At the Northwestern Front, the Grand Duke inquired whether it was not \"advisable to withdraw the front in Poland further back to strengthen the middle Njemen and the roads to Kowno, the section that was to support the future front.\" The blows delivered that day by the German 12th and 8th Armies south of Lomza against the Russian 12th and by the Mackensen Army Group at Lubartow against the 3rd Army accelerated the execution of the retreat movement. \"To prevent the armies from complete dissolution,\" General Alexejew ordered on August 10 for the 12th, 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 3rd Armies to retreat further to a line running south past Lubow east of Diswiece. The movement was to be carried out gradually; cavalry and rearguards were to repeatedly hold up the enemy and force development, while entire corps were to be released as reserves at the same time. However, this movement also led to further withdrawal of the 13th Army, stationed southwest of Kowel with its right wing on the Bug, which the Supreme Command would have liked to keep standing to protect Brest Litowsk. On the other hand, the southwestern front, weakened by detachments for the north, was already so weakened that it was hardly able to hold its line.\n",
      "The rapid advance of the German attack against Kowno increased concerns. On August 14, the Supreme Command designated the best and numerically strongest corps of the army, the Guard Corps, from the 3rd Army to Wilna; this army thereby shrank from 90,000 to 63,000 rifles, distributed among five remaining corps (ten divisions).\n",
      "The following days brought a decisive change in the organization of the army. After discussions that went back to July 28 and after a meeting with General Alexejew on August 16 at his new headquarters in Wolkowysk, on August 17, the division of the oversized Northwestern Front into a Northern Front was ordered.</body>\n",

      "On August 16, in its new headquarters at Wolkowysk, the division of the oversized Northwestern Front into a Northern Front (under General Ruzski, the recovered former commander of the Northwestern Front), and a Western Front under General Alexeyev was ordered on August 17. The new division was to take effect on August 31. While the Western Front would cover the roads to Moscow with the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 3rd Armies along the Grodno-Brest line, the Northern Front (with the 6th Army responsible for coastal defense, the 5th Army, a new 12th Army to be formed at Vilna by dissolving the existing 12th and 13th, and the 10th Army) would cover the routes leading over the sea from East Prussia to Petersburg, for which it was also assigned the Baltic Fleet, and hold the line of the middle Njemen. Above all, Kowno, the strong support of this front, was to be held against the ongoing German attack by all means. The aim was further to gather enough forces to push the enemy on this flank back to the west, \"to deprive him of the favorable starting position for an encirclement of the entire front.\" Therefore, General Alexeyev was to give up the Guard Corps of the 3rd Army and the two most combat-ready corps of the 13th Army to form the new 12th Army at Vilna, but instead, he gave two exhausted corps (II Siberian and II Caucasian).\n",
      "Moreover, these plans were already changed in the following days by the unexpected fall of Kowno on August 18 and the entry of German naval units into the Gulf of Riga, and on the other hand, the question of a reappointment of the supreme army leadership became noticeable. Since General Suchomlinov was no longer Minister of War, the position of the Chief of the General Staff, General Januschkewitsch, was also considered shaken. When General Alexeyev, who was suspected to be the successor, now proposed forming the 12th Army not at Vilna but at Riga under the changed circumstances, but first to consult General Ruzski as the future commander of the Northern Front, the Grand Duke rejected the latter; but he himself also \"wished to issue no instructions to exert pressure.\" Thus, the new army was formed at Riga according to General Alexeyev's intention. The deployment demanded and partially already ordered by General Ruzski in view of the appearance of German warships off Pernau was prevented by General Aljezejew when the German ships soon left the Gulf of Riga.\n",

The fall of this fortress also forced the abandonment of the entire line Kowno—Grodno—Brest Litowsk. The front was to be withdrawn, but in such a way that the railway Wilna—Baranowicze—Rowno remained secured as a cross-connection behind it.\n",
      "On August 22, Disna was released. After the 4th Army was shaken by the German Army Detachment Woyrsch on August 25 and in view of the simultaneous threat from the southeast, the prepared evacuation of the strong modern fortress Brest Litowsk was also carried out, General Aljezejew ordered the general retreat to the line Grodno—Rowno on the night of August 26.\n",

Here, the Minister of War, General Polivanow, brought the news to the Grand Duke on August 22 of the Tsar's decision to take over the supreme command himself with General Aljezejew as Chief of Staff. The Grand Duke was then to be assigned the Caucasus Front. From then until the Tsar's arrival on September 5, the previous Supreme Army Command did not intervene decisively in the events that were hardly sustainable anyway. How the views of its previously leading personalities were at that time is characterized by the report of Prince Kudaschew from August 30: The outgoing Quartermaster General, General Danilow, said that lack of ammunition and declining morale left little hope for significant improvement of the situation; nevertheless, \"the final victory can remain ours under two conditions: 1. that we do not despair and do not tire despite all trials, 2. that we do not have a revolution.\" Otherwise, the prevailing view was: The Germans, judging by the tone of their press, have the double solution: 1. Strike both south and east. Accordingly, our goal must be: 1. Conclude a pure peace before the Germans are expelled from Russia, 2. maintain the ranks of the army.</body>\n",

      "<body>The overall course of Russian operations until early September was a stubborn struggle for every inch of ground and protection of the \"evacuation\" of territories, which ultimately had to be abandoned; nothing was to fall into the enemy's hands that could serve him in any way for warfare.\n",
      "From a purely military point of view, objections can be raised against such a type of warfare, as it exhausted the army's forces in pure defense, even though there was room to retreat. With timely withdrawal of the front, the Russian army could have been almost entirely withdrawn from decisive attacks by the Central Powers. A major German operation north of the Njemen would likely have come to a halt soon if a strong Russian right flank had been established early, as it would have been at a disadvantage due to poorer rear connections. This would have led to purely frontal attrition in trench warfare, with the Russian army remaining a fully valid power factor in a strong defensive position and dangerously close to the borders of Germany, ready to break out again into a major offensive at the appropriate time. This could have offset any partial success the Central Powers might have achieved on other fronts in the meantime.\n",
      "For the decision on the fundamental question of how the war should be conducted on a large scale, however, as mentioned at the outset, military considerations alone were not decisive, but alongside considerations of the wishes of the Western powers, ultimately external and internal political conditions, and thus the Tsar and his government. It cannot be overlooked that the procedure used tied up very strong German forces throughout the summer, which would have been freed for other theaters of war with a rapid retreat to the Njemen-Bug line. In fact, the Russian command skillfully traversed the hundreds of kilometers of retreat areas, and did so systematically in the direction it had chosen itself, resulting in the cramped space between Oswiece and the Rokitno swamps. However, the resistance power of the troops failed because they lacked officers, trained replacements, weapons, and ammunition, which ultimately affected morale. It is noteworthy that until the final battles against the Central Powers, apart from the established fortresses, before and around Przemysl, Nowogeorgiewsk, and Kowno, the unplanned, often immobile and outdated equipment, from mid-May to the end of August, the total number did not exceed 200 pieces.</body>\n",

Meanwhile, the losses of artillery had notably decreased since about the beginning of July, so that perhaps at this time, in connection with the idea of a general retreat, greater restraint in the use of artillery may have been ordered. According to a report made to the French ambassador at the end of August¹) by the Russian General Staff, the total Russian losses from May to July were 350,000 monthly, in August 450,000, totaling 1,500,000 men.\n",
      "The measures actually taken on the Russian side also raise the question of what prospects a large German offensive on Wilna, initiated early, at the latest after the capture of the Narew line, i.e., around the end of July, would have had. It could have been supported by a land and sea attack against Riga, but above all by simultaneous sharp pressure on both sides of the Bug from the south. The forces for this would have been readily available. The Narew thrust had already delivered what was expected of it, and west of the Vistula, any combat-ready unit was dispensable. A strong German offensive, suddenly launched against Kowno and on both sides of this fortress, would have initially encountered very little Russian resistance on the right bank of the Niemen and could have penetrated deeply in a rapid first advance; it would have taken a long time for the Russians to bring up sufficient forces to counter such a thrust. The German success had to be all the greater, the more it succeeded in destroying the Russian forces standing around Kowno in a double encirclement, gaining space to the south, and thereby blocking the three railway lines leading into the interior of the Reich between Osowiec and the Rokitno marshes. In view of the strong Russian countermeasures that were sure to be expected, such an offensive had to become increasingly difficult with increasing distance from its own sources of strength and with the simultaneous, rising supply needs due to the duration and intensity of the fighting. It was therefore crucial to achieve in time to block the mentioned supply lines early and keep them blocked for the duration of the fighting, thereby also making it difficult, if not entirely preventing, the supply of the Russian masses streaming back from Poland. That with such conduct of operations a surrender of significant parts of the Russian army could have been achieved is possible; certainly, however, a much faster and, for the Russians, especially in terms of equipment, more loss-intensive retreat from Poland would have been forced than by the encirclement attempt west of Bug and Niemen.</body>\n",

      "According to the order of the Supreme Army Command of September 25, the permanent position in the section of the Commander-in-Chief East was to run from the mouth of the Beresyna into the Njemen to the Baltic Sea coast. The connection at the Gulf of Riga resulted in by far the shortest line. Even it measured almost 400 kilometers in the air. However, the troops had already advanced almost 100 kilometers beyond this shortest line to the east on a broad front and were engaged in heavy fighting against attacking enemies east of Wilna and also near Dünaburg. Overall, the Commander-in-Chief East currently had 37½ infantry divisions and nine cavalry divisions, but could only count on about 28 divisions of infantry in the long run²).\n",
      "Under these circumstances, all previous far-reaching plans, such as advancing to Minsk and capturing Riga, had to be finally abandoned³). But even the battle east of Wilna, which in any case promised no major territorial gains, had to be abandoned if further execution of the attack against Dünaburg became questionable. A line as short as possible and favorable for defense had to be chosen, and the front at Wilna even had to be moved back. That the enemy could count such a retreat as a victory had to be accepted.\n",
      "On September 27, the Commander-in-Chief East presented a report on the situation and intentions, requested by the Supreme Army Command, stating that it would probably not be possible to push the enemy back before the right wing of the 10th Army. He continuously reinforced and extended his wing east of Wilna and apparently moved forces into the area east of the Narocz-See-Dünaburg line. An imminent offensive against this line had to be expected. The offensive of the 8th and 10th Army is therefore suspended. The 10th Army initially bends its left wing back to the Narocz-See and moves forces from its center to the area north of the Narocz-See. A reinforcement of the left wing of the Njemen Army is also necessary. The army group occupies its permanent position in the line Berezyna-Mündung—Narocz-See—area west of Dünaburg—Mitau—Schloß.\n",

How many divisions could then still be transferred and in what timeframes, however, could not yet be foreseen.\n",
      "After the armies had already been informed about the intentions in general and had been duly informed about the manner of execution, the Commander-in-Chief East firmly established the line guidance for the permanent position on September 28. It was to run from the Njemen to the Lida—Molodeczno railway along the Berezyna, thus in the previous front, then over the Narocz Lake to the Driswjaty Lake and further along the Düna to follow the current position of the Njemen Army. Although it was the outermost line, it offered such great advantages through the exploitation of natural obstacles that it was expected to be held with the least forces. The position was to gain a certain depth through the construction of several lines and behind it, at a short distance, a second position was to be explored and prepared. At the same time, efforts began to reorganize the units, which had been largely destroyed due to the battles, and to restructure the entire front. The previous 8th Army was dissolved and had to transfer its troops to the 12th Army; its deputy commander-in-chief, General von Scholz, with Lieutenant Colonel Count von Schwerin as Chief of Staff, was soon to take over a newly forming army group between the 10th and the Njemen Army, which would then be assigned the area from the Düna to halfway Dünaburg—Jakobstadt. Hand in hand with these changes went the redistribution of forces to the individual armies.\n",
      "The occupation of the permanent position proceeded largely according to plan, but still under numerous local battles. They were most intense with the 10th and the Njemen Army, in the area east of Wilna and near Dünaburg.\n",
      "For the 10th Army, it was important to shorten the front in the area west of Molodeczno by removing the protruding Russian position arc from Smorgon. In doing so, the right wing of the Litzmann group made good progress south of the city on September 27. On September 28, the outermost left wing of the old 8th Army, General von Frommel with the 83rd Infantry and 11th Landwehr Division, gained ground at the Berezyna bend northeast of Wiszniew and captured more than 3000 prisoners and nine machine guns.</body>\n",

      "<body>General von Frommel with the 83rd Infantry and 11th Landwehr Division, at the Berezyna bend northeast of Wiszniew, captured more than 3000 prisoners and nine machine guns. However, the battle for the city of Smorgon itself was particularly stubborn. Here, the left wing of Group Litzmann from the west and the right of Group Eben from the northeast worked together, but only the attack of the latter (3rd Reserve and 31st Infantry Division) on the east bank of the Wilia from the north advanced, capturing 400 prisoners and guns on September 29 and advancing deep into the rear of Smorgon on September 30. The further advance of the left wing of Group Litzmann, however, stalled due to a lack of ammunition. Surrounded from the west, north, and east in an arc of only four kilometers in diameter, the Russians managed to hold the city of Smorgon. Meanwhile, the left wing of the German 10th Army had disengaged from the enemy, after the latter had dealt a serious blow to the 77th Reserve Division east of Wilejka on September 27. Otherwise, the withdrawal proceeded systematically and essentially undisturbed to a line running from the Wilia east of Smorgon over the Wiszniew Lake to the Narocz Lake. The Russians followed and captured, according to their own account, abandoned vehicles and ammunition, while \"only very few prisoners\" fell into their hands. The idea of inflicting further damage on them through a counterattack was abandoned by the German 10th Army's high command when, on the night of September 30, reports arrived, including a Russian order captured by the 9th Cavalry Division, indicating a deep advance by the approximately four-division-strong Kasnakow Cavalry Corps from the east into the gap north of the Narocz Lake was expected for that day. The expected Russian advances only came on October 1 and were repelled at Kosjany and south without difficulty on that and the following day.</body>\n",

      "Precisely here, in the area of Krosjany and north to Lake Dryswjaty, the enemy continued his efforts against the weak German forces stationed here in the following days with great superiority, deploying not only strong cavalry but also his entire IV Corps²⁵). Meanwhile, German infantry had also arrived, so that the stubborn attempts of the enemy, repeatedly made on October 3 and the following days, eventually encountered the resistance of five German infantry and 5½ cavalry divisions and could be more easily repelled everywhere since then.\n",
      "The Supreme Army Command now demanded, as it had long anticipated²⁶), further contributions, which it urgently needed in view of the difficult situation in the West and the Serbian campaign²⁷). These could only be provided without endangering the defense in the extended lines of the Commander-in-Chief East, after these had been further consolidated and the fortification of positions had made some progress. I currently estimated the 10th Army at its front at 38 divisions; this was more than the total forces of the Commander-in-Chief East²⁸). In an assessment of the situation demanded by the Supreme Army Command, it was explained to them on October 6: \"Russians are attacking the 10th Army and the right wing of the Niemen Army with all their might, intending to break through to the Dünaburg—Wilna road or at least to make it impossible to withdraw further forces of the Eastern Army to the West through their attack. I expect that it will be possible to prevent the enemy from breaking off.\" A contribution of further forces, it was then said, was impossible and could only occur, if the attack was repelled, after a shortening of the front had been achieved by taking Smorgon and the bridgehead of Dünaburg.</body>\n",

      "<body>For this, some of the heaviest batteries were urgently requested. The shortening of the front was all the more necessary as the Commander-in-Chief also had to withdraw reserves from the center for his own needs to lead the left wing, as any potential penetration of the front at Mitau \"would have the most serious consequences.\"\n",
      "General von Falkenhayn immediately responded: \"Undoubtedly, it would be advantageous if the current position of the army group could be permanently held and, in addition, pressure could be exerted in the direction of Dünaburg.\" However, if the question arises whether the retention of forces is permissible, whose absence on the Western Front could endanger the German position, it must be absolutely denied. He suggested shortening the front if necessary by retreating to the line Smorgoń—Dünaburg—Bausk or even to one that runs straight from Smorgoń to Bausk. However, it must be adhered to the allocations; the heaviest guns could only be transferred once they were freed from the Serbian front after the Danube crossing. In contrast, the Commander-in-Chief East emphasized on October 7 that the position currently occupied, with or without shortening at Smorgoń and Dünaburg, was by far the most favorable that could be taken. It should be held with a minimum of forces. Any rearward position that dispensed with the protection of the Düna would require more, but at least the same forces as the position without shortening the front. He therefore left it at the line previously ordered for the permanent position. On the other hand, General von Falkenhayn did not insist on the transfer of all units requested in September; instead of 13, only nine infantry divisions were eventually transferred.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the 10th Army repelled all attacks directed against its left wing. However, their forces were so engaged that the idea of taking Smorgoń had to be finally abandoned on October 11. Also, on both sides of the Düna, where the Russian pressure persisted, the thinly manned front was withdrawn on October 19 from Kossjany by about 15 kilometers to Widzy, where the defensive conditions were considered more favorable by the troops than in the previously held forward line.\n",
      "With the Njemen Army, the attack on Dünaburg was continued as far as the forces allowed. On October 6, 7, and 8, the I Reserve Corps under General von Morgen (36th, 1st, and 78th Reserve Divisions) made progress against the northwest front of the bridgehead and captured 1,350 prisoners.</body>\n",

      "<body>The I Reserve Corps under General von Morgen (36th, 1st, and 78th Reserve Division) made progress against the northwest front of the bridgehead and captured 1350 prisoners. However, on October 9, fierce Russian counterattacks began, which were repeated on October 11, 14, and 17, and also extended further south. They were unsuccessful everywhere. On the German side, it was necessary to hold back for the time being, as heavy artillery and ammunition were scarce and the extremely unfavorable railway conditions precluded rapid and regular supply. Thus, the attack against the northwest front could only be resumed on October 23 after reinforcing the artillery. 14 batteries of heavy and heaviest artillery prepared the assault of the 2nd Infantry, 78th, and 1st Reserve Division, which then broke into the enemy positions over a ten-kilometer width. They reached Illuxt, captured 3700 prisoners and 12 machine guns, and inflicted extraordinarily heavy bloody losses on the Russian masses retreating towards the Dvina bridges. But then the attack came to a halt. A further success achieved on October 26 had only local significance.\n",
      "Overall, despite the use of stronger artillery and all the efforts of the troops, the goal of reaching the Dvina line was not decisively closer; it would have required significantly stronger attacking forces than the railway situation allowed to bring in and equip with war supplies. Since October 1, two months earlier than originally planned, the Bajohren—Prekuln¹) connecting railway was put into operation, and thus a line independent of the sea connection to Schaulen—Poniewiez and Mitau was opened, the situation was initially only slightly eased, as the capacity of the new route was still very low. The enemy still held a bridgehead on the west bank of the Dvina, which extended about 20 kilometers north from the fortress of Dünaburg and was about ten kilometers deep. The Commander-in-Chief East found the progress made unsatisfactory in the overall situation. He feared the onset of frost before the troops could expand the permanent position and therefore suggested on October 27 to halt the attack. However, General von Below, like General von Morgen and their subordinates, hoped that gaining the Dvina bank would lead to a decisive improvement in the positions and also believed that halting the attack before the goal was reached would negatively affect the troops.</body>\n",

However, when this attempt had to be postponed on October 30 due to the ammunition situation, they were also in favor of stopping the attack. The order for this was given on November 1 by the Commander-in-Chief East.\n",
      "General Otto von Below had also been eager to simultaneously advance the positions at Mitau further against the Düna with the attack on Dünaburg and thus shorten the overall line. This goal was achieved on October 15 through a surprise attack led by Lieutenant General Hans von Below, involving the 6th Reserve Division, 6th Landwehr, and 174th Infantry Brigade1), which brought in 1000 prisoners. Since then, the German position ran along the Düna to Kirchholm and then at the southern edge of the Tirul-Gumpf near Riga to the west to the coast at Schloss. Thus, the enemy also maintained an extensive bridgehead on the left bank of the Düna here, as well as at Dünaburg and Jakobstadt.\n",
      "All in all, the October battles of the Njemen Army once again brought in 12,000 prisoners and 37 machine guns as booty. However, this was offset by about 15,000 of their own losses.\n",
      "The situation on the sea flank2) remained constantly uncertain, now stretched from the Reich border over 360 kilometers. English submarines that had penetrated the Baltic Sea and Russian mines not only hindered trade traffic to Scandinavia and the only one still open to Germany, but also caused losses to the German Baltic Sea forces, which from July to the end of the year included an armored cruiser, two small cruisers, and about twelve other vehicles, while corresponding losses of the more restrained Russian fleet were not present. Instead, it had gained a significant increase through four new battleships. If it did not exploit its great superiority in any way, but continued to limit itself to covering the route to Petersburg in the Gulf of Finland, this was mainly due to the presence of this hostile force along with the English submarines and the ever-new mine barriers affecting the overall situation in the Baltic Sea. The sea route to Libau was constantly endangered, its port defenseless against long-range fire from ship guns. The Gulf of Riga remained a dominion of the Russian fleet, secured by mine barriers against German ships, whose forces repeatedly disturbed the German coastal surveillance with artillery fire and small landing operations.</body>\n",

Such an extensive operation was not conceivable for the time being due to a lack of forces. Only when the sea bay froze over could peace from the sea be hoped for.\n",
      "At the entire land front of the Commander-in-Chief East, combat activity decreased as the construction of positions progressed and the situation stabilized, while at the same time fatigue from the enormous efforts of the long summer campaign, lack of ammunition, and the onset of winter imposed restrictions on both sides. Between November 10 and 17, which now received the designation \"8th Army\"2), the Army Group Scholz was formed on October 28 from contributions from both, whose front, starting at Widsh, was extended northward to below Dünaburg in the first days of November. Here, the Russians had made a strong advance shortly before, on November 6, using very explosive Japanese ammunition, which inflicted serious losses on the German 36th Reserve Division. After uninterrupted attack battles, this unit had to be withdrawn in peace because the \"supply was inadequate, bringing in winter items was not possible due to urgent ammunition transports\"; the men of the division were \"partly still dressed in rags\"3).\n",

      "The supply conditions had gradually improved thanks to the tireless efforts of the supply authorities. While troop numbers and combat activity had decreased, the supply requirements had not, as the construction of positions and preparations for winter necessitated extensive new demands. Far-sighted, most strenuous work by the railway authorities and troops had been necessary to bridge the border regions, which the Russians had deliberately kept poor in transport infrastructure, with limited resources. East of the Vistula, at the beginning of the war, only three railway lines led into Russia via Mlawa, Ostrowiec, and Kowno, with only the latter being double-tracked. In winter 1914/15, the connection Marggrabowa—Suwalki, constructed by the Russians, was added, then, built by German railway troops, in August the Willenberg—Ostrolenka line and since October 1st the Bajohren—Prekuln section, while simultaneously repairing the partially sustained damage to the captured Russian sections. During the Narew Operation, railway construction and restoration in northern Poland had taken priority, with the aim of gaining connection to the eastward-leading Russian main lines east of the presumably destroyed Vistula bridges of Warsaw and the Bug bridge of Malkin. Later, the restoration of the double-track railway via Kowno to Wilna was added as particularly important. West of Wilna, the tunnel of Landwarowo¹) could only be made passable by October 10th. The Njemen bridge at Olita was not completed until November 25th, and the Njemen bridge in Grodno not until December 5th, with traffic beyond these points resuming accordingly. Meanwhile, the railway network still showed very significant deficiencies; above all, north of the Njemen it could handle no more than the most urgent supplies. Since the completion of the railway bridges at Olita and Grodno, conditions improved somewhat through the relief of the Kowno route. However, the deficiencies of the very low-capacity Courland railway network could not be remedied in the foreseeable future. Here, troops and replacement transports continued to rely on foot marches from Schaulen or even from Tilsit; even the most urgent supply requirements of the troops exceeded the capacity of the railways by far and led to traffic congestion until conditions normalized. Thus, a general traveling on behalf of the Supreme Army Command in early December needed 29 hours for the journey from Army Command 10 in Wilna to Schaulen (200 kilometers), and from there to Army Command 8 in Poniewicz (80 kilometers) another 24 hours.\n",

This territory, which included the area behind Army Group Prince Leopold and, despite the separation of the General Government of Warsaw¹), still encompassed around 220,000 square kilometers. From this territory, which corresponded to approximately two-fifths of the then German Empire in size, it was necessary not only to supply their own troops with provisions and horses but also to provide resources to the homeland and the Western Army when possible.\n",
      "When the Kaiser visited the area of the Commander-in-Chief East with General von Falkenhayn towards the end of the year, Field Marshal von Hindenburg briefed him about the situation in Wilna on December 12. He considered the right wing and center of his front secure; the construction of positions had already made good progress here. As reserves, the 12th and 10th Armies and the Army Detachment Scholtz had each only been able to withdraw one mixed brigade. The situation appeared more precarious with the new 8th Army. Here, they had to be prepared for Russian attacks, especially once frost set in and the Düna, the lakes, and marsh lowlands would no longer pose obstacles. Only two infantry divisions stood as reserves behind this front; reinforcement was desired here. The Commander-in-Chief East did not expect major landings on the coast, but he did anticipate troublesome bombardments from the sea and threats from agents and spies who were being deployed behind their own lines. Until now, as he further explained, it had been possible to compensate for the lack of troops through mobility; however, this solution failed in the interior of Russia. The railway conditions did not allow for rapid redeployments; where troops were stationed, they generally had to be used there.</body>\n",

For weeks, his primary concern as the leader of overall operations was the desire to make sufficient forces available as soon as possible for the campaign against Serbia, deemed absolutely necessary. Additionally, the possibility had to be considered that the Western opponents might deploy their reserves, which had grown to nearly 50 infantry divisions, against this offensive as well. It was also necessary to strengthen the Eastern forces. This was most feasible from the center of the army front in Russia.

Thus, he not only returned to his earlier proposal, expressed in the spirit of Field Marshal von Hindenburg, to reinforce his army group for the upcoming offensive on Wilna, but he also suggested simultaneous actions by the army groups Mackensen and Prince Leopold up to the area of Pinsk and to the Jasiolda. General von Falkenhayn remained firm against these proposals, maintaining the position he had already justified in a letter to Colonel General von Conrad on August 26: \"Certainly, strengthening the Kronow Group is desirable, but it is far more important that the Dardanelles are closed, and that the iron in Bulgaria is forged as long as it is hot. Consequently, the forces we can withdraw from the area of Brest Litowsk, without initially loosening the grip on the enemy's throat, must be directed to the Danube.\"\n",
      "The initial impetus for the operations of the army groups Mackensen and Prince Leopold not coming to a halt after the capture of Brest Litowsk, contrary to the intentions of General von Falkenhayn, came from the High Command of the Mackensen Army Group. Already on the evening of August 26, Major General von Seeckt had expressed in a report to the Supreme Army Command the view that stubborn enemy resistance south of the large Jasiolda swamps was not to be expected, and that apparently \"there was still the prospect of a generous encirclement of the Russian army,\" provided that the advance of the Hindenburg Army Group on and over Wilna was considered promising. The cooperation of the Mackensen and Prince Leopold army groups in this regard manifested in an advance over the line Kobryn—Kamieniec Litowsk in the direction of Pruzana under cover against the east and closure of the southern edge of the Bialoviez forest. Field Marshal von Mackensen therefore also continued the pursuit of the Bug Army and the 11th Army eastward on August 27. Also, with the Prince Leopold Army Group, the Woyrsch Army Detachment forced the crossing over the Lesna Prawa under fighting, while the 9th Army continued the blockade of the Bialoviez forest.\n",
      "The confidence expressed by Major General von Seeckt in assessing the overall situation did not leave an impression on General von Falkenhayn. Although he adhered to fundamental instructions for the operations of the near future¹), which were issued on the night of August 28, that the army groups Mackensen and Prince Leopold with their main forces should halt their advance eastward at the swampy terrain east of the line Ratno—Kobryn—Szereszow and only remain on all roads with smaller mixed units against the enemy.</body>\n",

Both army groups were also tasked with the immediate construction of field positions along the general line Bug—Brest Litowsk—extent of the Bialowiez forest—mouth of the Narewka into the Narew, which should be suitable for permanent holding with the least possible forces. At the same time, however, General von Falkenhayn pointed to early grouping for an advance of the inner wings of both army groups, which under certain circumstances would lead over the line Pruzana—Szereszow northward against the enemy's rear connections north of the Bialowiez forest.\n",
      "Consequently, Field Marshal von Mackensen ordered on August 28 that the Bug Army should continue its assigned pursuit over Antopol—Kobryn only as far as an impact on the southern flank of the Russian forces retreating eastward could be hoped for. The 11th Army was also to pursue only with its right wing up to the Muchawiec section. However, its left wing (the corps Kosch reinforced by four infantry divisions) was to advance to Pruzana in conjunction with the action ordered by Field Marshal Prince Leopold of the army detachment Woyrsch on Szereszow to create the conditions for a continuation of the offensive northward. The desired flank pressure of the Bug Army did not materialize. The enemy was pushed back purely frontally in fierce and for him costly battles until August 29 over the line Kobryn—Szereszewno. This resulted in a strong destruction and weakening of his units. The 11th Army alone captured 3700 prisoners on August 29. The army detachment Woyrsch encountered strong resistance on both sides of Szereszow. Aerial reconnaissance reported the departure of endless columns up to and beyond the Sczara, extensive troop gatherings at Pruzana, and heavy column traffic from there to Glomino and from Rozana northward. At the Koslow station, on the Brest Litowsk—Baranowicze railway, large supplies were stored.\n",
      "General von Falkenhayn believed, from the booty numbers and reconnaissance results transmitted to him on the evening of August 29, that there was still the possibility of inflicting severe damage on the enemy by further sharp pursuit of the Mackensen army group in a northeasterly direction up to the Jasiołda section.</body>\n",

He informed the high commands of both army groups during the night that he had no objections to such an operation with a simultaneous advance of Prince Leopold's army group over Pruzana. However, since only slow frontal pushing back of the Russians was possible on August 30, and since the own troops had already suffered greatly from supply and replenishment difficulties, Field Marshal von Hindenburg saw no prospect of a major success. He decided to halt the advance after the capture of Pruzana and ordered for August 31, apart from a short advance on the main Kobryn road over the Muchawiec section, only the reinforced Koch Corps on the left wing of the 11th Army to continue the pursuit up to the Dranczye—Pruzana road in connection with the Woyrsch army detachment. In response to an inquiry from the Supreme Army Command, he reported on the morning of August 31: \"Hope of intercepting significant parts of the enemy between Jasiodla and Muchawiec section no longer exists. The main reason is that the Bug Army failed to swing in time against the southern flank with the right wing, nor with the cavalry corps. Frontal pursuit of the right wing and middle 11th Army over swampy terrain promised no significant success, as the withdrawal of the Russians was initiated in time and was carried out systematically with alternating rear guards ... Heavy rain showers will halt troop movements in the swampy terrain everywhere. Condition of the troops is good, although probably partially fatigued. Performance of the horses, especially with heavy artillery and columns, is particularly declining in some places. Losses are concerning.\"\n",
      "Nevertheless, General von Falkenhayn urgently recommended that at least on the passable roads along the entire front, a sharp pursuit up to the Jasiodla section should be made. This was also necessary to facilitate the advance of the Woyrsch army detachment and at the same time to gain advantage from it. In the subsequently ordered continuation of the pursuit up to Jasiodla, the Bug Army was instructed to direct its left wing along the road over Kobryn to Bereza Kartuska. While in the evening its right wing was stuck in front of the Sniper-Bug Canal, secured to the south by the divisions of the now established cavalry corps, its left wing gained more space on the main road in conjunction with the 11th Army. The Guard Cavalry Division under Lieutenant General von Storch reached Luft. On the northern wing of the 11th Army, the Koch Corps advanced into the area north of Malecz. The Woyrsch army detachment reached Jasiodla with advance troops after the capture of Pruzana. Arrival of</body>\n",

      "On September 1st, Field Marshal von Mackensen once again urged his two armies to advance quickly on both sides of the main road Kobryn—Bereza Kartuska up to the Jasiolda. Simultaneously, the Bug Army was also to advance towards Pinsk to prevent the enemy from withdrawing by rail. It accordingly shifted its center of gravity to the right in this direction. Again, the day brought heavy fighting along the entire line against the Russian rear guards, who were firmly entrenched behind canal and swamp stretches and determined to maintain stubborn defense. No significant successes were achieved.\n",
      "However, when in the early morning of September 2nd, the 82nd Reserve Division under General Fabarius broke through the hotly contested position at the Dniepr—Bug Canal near Horodec, the enemy soon retreated on the remaining front as well. Both armies pressed forward. General von Linsingen still hoped to encircle the forces retreating towards Pinsk from both sides. In the evening, he placed his right wing (5th Cavalry Division, XXXXI Reserve Corps and 107th Infantry Division) under General von Gerok for a thrust along the railway towards Pinsk, while the Beskiden Corps was to pursue along the main road towards Bereza Kartuska, with the main force advancing southeastward south of the Jasiolda. The 11th Army reached the Jasiolda with Kosch Corps at Sielec. As the General Command of the X Reserve Corps with the 103rd and 105th Infantry Divisions was now to be withdrawn¹), it was replaced by the X Army Corps (19th Infantry and 47th Reserve Division, with the 20th Infantry Division in reserve behind).\n",
      "The Army Group Prince Leopold gained little ground on September 1st and 2nd. The enemy offered stubborn resistance both to the Army Detachment Woyrsch at the few crossings of the wide marshy lowlands of the Jasiolda and to the 9th Army at Nowydwor and northwest of it. Early in the morning of September 2nd, a directive from the Supreme Army Command had arrived, according to which Army Group Prince Leopold was to continue the offensive against the road section Slonim—Zelwa²). In the evening, Army Group Mackensen also received orders to participate in this attack with its left wing in the direction of Slonim.

Here, in accordance with the directives of the Commander-in-Chief East from August 29¹), the 12th Army was in rapid pursuit eastward across the Swislocz sector, while to its left, the 8th Army captured the fortress of Grodno on September 2. The Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army wanted to use this situation to attempt, through cooperation between Army Group Prince Leopold and the right wing of Army Group Hindenburg, to push the retreating enemy towards the northeast. His vision was to use simultaneous corresponding pressure from the 10th Army from the northwest in the direction of Lida to compress large masses of the enemy onto the marsh islands of Slonin²).\n",
      "The advance of Army Group Prince Leopold³) in the direction of Slonim—Zelwa encountered stubborn resistance on September 3 and 4 at the flooded Jassolda sector and northwest of it during torrential rain. The Marwitz Group of the 11th Army was also held up at Bereza Kartuska. Only on September 5 did the pursuit resume on the left wing of Army Group Prince Leopold, and the following day along almost its entire front. By September 8, its right wing, meanwhile reinforced by the 119th Infantry Division from Army Group Mackensen, had approached to within about 35 kilometers of the Szczara north of the Brest Litovsk—Baranowicze railway. The following day, the Marwitz Group also overcame the Jassolda sector. It was now placed under the command of Army Detachment Woyrsch. Army Group Prince Leopold was again held up until September 12 by enemy resistance west of the upper Griwda and at the Zelwianka.\n",

However, the immediate pursuit already stalled on the evening of September 14 at the broad swamp section of the Szczara. Attempts by the Landwehr Corps to force a crossing at Slonim in the following days initially brought only minor local successes. On the night of September 18, the enemy continued its retreat along the entire front. The Supreme Army Command, in view of the advancing operations of Army Group Hindenburg in the Wilna¹) area, considered \"aggressive pursuit also by Army Group Prince Leopold urgently necessary\" and on September 19 gave its left wing, which had already reached the railway northwest of Molczadz, the almost northward direction toward Nowogrodek. Tenacious resistance from enemy rear guards and bottomless roads continued to hamper the advance. By September 21, the pursuit reached just before Baranowicze and the area south of Nowogrodek. Strong resistance appeared anew at the Myschanka. Only on the night of September 23 did the enemy evacuate his positions. The Army Group advanced to the upper course of the Szczara on both sides of the Baranowicze—Minsk railway and to the Serwetsch. Thus the important railway junction of Baranowicze fell into German hands. The right wing of the 12th Army gained ground east of Nowogrodek.\n",
      "Field Marshal Leopold Prince of Bavaria still believed he could \"further build on the success by continuing the offensive jointly with Army Group Hindenburg toward Minsk.\" General von Falkenhayn, however, had decided to definitively halt the purely frontal pursuit, as the desired operational result had completely failed to materialize. On the night of September 24, Army Group Prince Leopold received orders \"not to cross the Szczara section above the Oginski Canal nor the Serwetsch and Njemen with the main force.\" On September 25, the Supreme Army Command ordered Army Group Prince Leopold to take up a permanent position along the line Oginski Canal (from Telechany)—Upper Szczara—Serwetsch—mouth of the Berezyna into the Njemen.\n",

      "\"The 119th Infantry Division has been in continuous forward movement since May 2. This has resulted in conditions that urgently need remedy if the division is not to completely lose its combat effectiveness one day.\n",
      "In the infantry, the number of departures due to illness from overexertion increases daily. The influx of replacement troops cannot keep pace. In the relentless advance, it is impossible for the replacement troops to reach the division. Transport times of six weeks since the start of the march are now the norm. Instead of fresh, combat-ready troops, exhausted, footsore men arrive, a high percentage of whom have already fallen ill along the way. It hardly needs mentioning that the weeks-long marches of the replacement transports with at most two officers, without properly organized units, without corporal leaders, etc., are not conducive to maintaining discipline. All troops urgently need replacement clothing and equipment. The infantry particularly lacks boots; if the men do not help themselves by taking boots from captured or fallen Russians, many would have to go barefoot.\n",
      "Mounted units suffer from constant horse losses. The artillery and columns, which have long been advancing only at a walking pace due to poor roads, lose several horses daily, which collapse from exhaustion and have to be shot. The increased performance of the horses is not nearly matched by their nutrition. Oats are supplied irregularly and in insufficient quantities by the supply columns, and in the country, the systematic utilization and preparation of known suitable potatoes, beets, and other grains is rarely possible during the daily long marches. Most of the horses are constantly outdoors, often in cold rain without shelter. Apart from combat losses, the daily loss of horses can be estimated at at least 25. How this loss is to be compensated is currently an unsolvable puzzle. The horse depots are exhausted, and they can occasionally procure small, poorly nourished horses, unsuitable for riding. Replacements from home also arrive weeks too late and are already exhausted from the march and the lack of fodder along the way, impairing their effectiveness.</body>\n",

      "and the lack of fodder on the way impairs its performance.\n",
      "With the downright miserable condition of the horses, which are the only reliable means of transport on the bad roads, further grievances arise that urgently need remedy. The artillery urgently needs material for the repair and maintenance of the guns. The heavy battery 119 has been firing with only two guns for a long time because the long-requested replacement material has not arrived. The same applies to the horseshoe material. It is now feared that the division will not be supplied with cleats when frost sets in, because the possibility of procuring the material is lacking.\n",
      "The division is currently particularly unfavorably positioned with artillery ammunition. Before September 24, the ammunition column department is unable to issue ammunition to the light columns. If the division continues to march, the distance to be covered by the light columns increases, and with it the difficulty of timely supplying the artillery with ammunition. If one disregards the demands that the ongoing battles will place on the nerve strength of the fighting troops and only considers the supply of the sick and wounded, it becomes apparent that the point in time when the division is also at the end of its performance capability is not far off. The evacuation of wounded from the field hospitals to the rear is becoming increasingly difficult because the rear cannot advance at the pace of the front troops. Therefore, the division is forced to leave the field hospitals in place for a long time and, on the other hand, faces increasing embarrassment regarding their follow-up and usability in the event of major losses. — The fact that communication with home via field post has almost completely ceased is mentioned only in passing.\n",
      "From the above, it follows that the division urgently needs some time to rest; otherwise, the day can already be predetermined when the division will consist only of staffs, regiments of 600 men, and guns without harness and ammunition.\"\n",
      "When passing on this report to the Supreme Army Command, Colonel General von Woyrsch remarked on September 23: \"Given the overriding importance of rapid progress in the current pursuit, I have so far paid no attention to such anxious concerns as expressed in the report, especially since the troops have remained remarkably good despite all hardships and have proven themselves excellently in the battles.\n",

However, I feel obliged to submit the attached, unsolicited report in the original, as the conditions in other parts of the army division and especially with the 23rd corps are gradually taking on a similar shape. The main reason for this lies essentially in the insufficient and particularly irregular supply by the railway, which the army division has unsuccessfully tried to improve.

      "A week before the pursuit operation of the army group Prince Leopold came to a halt, the Bug Army of the Mackensen army group had successfully carried out its assigned special operation, the attack on Pinsk. On September 3, the enemy had evaded their comprehensively planned attack north of the Dnieper-Bug Canal in an easterly direction. In two groups under the command of Generals von Gerok and von Conta, advancing frontally to the east, the army reached the line Zarzeczka-Chomsk and further northwest to Jasiolda. On September 6, the eastward-directed battlefront was carried forward by the assault of the 107th Infantry Division on Drohiczyn to the line Disvoce-Bezdziez. Due to the great distances from the railway points Wlodawa and Biala, the supply service began to fail here as well. The troops were no longer able to bring sufficient ammunition and supplies with their weakened columns over the destroyed roads and impassable paths. Thus, the Bug Army could initially only send mixed detachments after the enemy. Already on September 5, the chief of staff of the Mackensen army group had seen fit to report in detail to the Supreme Army Command about the condition of the troops. They had fully met the high demands on their physical and moral strength during the long period of fighting and had remained consistently confident and aggressive. However, they wished at least for the possibility of a short training of their replacements, or better yet a rest period, as the months-long, costly battles and marches in the most difficult terrain and with the greatest deprivations of all kinds had significantly sapped their strength. The guns were heavily worn out, but particularly concerning was the recent condition of the horses, both in the troops and in the columns, especially due to the ongoing shortage of fodder.</body>\n",

The next operations of the army group were merely a question of supply. The railway would be operational to Terespol west of Brest Litowsk by September 10 and to Kobryn by September 20. Accordingly, the Bug Army would not be able to resume the offensive on Pinsk until September 14, unless the advance weak detachments succeeded in forcing the enemy to retreat earlier.\n",

The breakthrough was completely successful. The Gerok Group advanced with its main effort on its right wing between the Dnieper-Bug Canal and the railway to Klimanoworodzevicz. In the Conta Group, the 1st and 22nd Infantry Divisions overran the enemy and advanced beyond Zawierze. On the night of September 13, the 107th Infantry Division succeeded in rolling up the enemy from the north in front of the Gerok Group. Now the entire front moved forward.

      "According to the agreements made on July 11 by the allied army commands²), during the offensive operation of the Mackensen Army Group, the German Southern Army³) and the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army⁴) were to remain defensive in Eastern Galicia at the Zlota Lipa and the Bug for the time being. Only the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army⁵), which had meanwhile grown to about ten infantry and five cavalry divisions, was assigned a spatially limited partial attack east of the Strypa in the direction of Czortkow—Buczacz. It began on the night of July 14, but only achieved a major success on the eastern flank. There, the Benigni Group managed to establish itself in the Meister Loop north of Doroschouts. Within a few days, however, the offensive had to be considered a failure. The only gain, achieved at the cost of heavy losses, seemed to be the Russians' abandonment of the apparently intended transfer of divisions to the 9th Army. In the last third of July, the fighting at the breach points subsided; towards the middle of the month, the enemy continued to launch fierce attacks against the Korda Corps on the extreme right flank, which, however, invariably broke down in the defensive fire of the defenders.\n",

      "August was calm at the front of all three armies of the right wing. Only with the 7th Army did a successful attack develop from a violent reconnaissance in the area of the Krautwald group, which led to the capture of the enemy bridgehead at Czernelica on August 9. Further-reaching offensive plans of the cavalry general Baron von Pflanzer-Baltin, which aimed at an attack by the Benigni group north of Doroschoutz and the Benigni corps at Kosmierzyn, had to be temporarily denied approval by Colonel General von Conrad, as he was forced to withdraw some forces from the 7th Army to reinforce the Italian front. On August 12, he ordered the removal of the III Corps (22nd and 28th Infantry Division). This section was taken over by the 5th Infantry Division, under the command of Field Marshal Lieutenant Ritter von Henriquez.\n",
      "The 2nd Army extended its left wing on the Bug to the Rata estuary on orders from Teschen on August 5 and reinforced the Czilbulka group with the 1st Cavalry Division withdrawn from the Southern Army. On August 6, the army commander, Cavalry General von Böhm-Ermolli, reported to the army command that his army, after receiving new replacements in mid-August, would count 100,000 rifles and would then be able to unite four divisions and the bulk of the heavy artillery on the southern flank for a breakthrough at Brody, in which the Southern Army would have to participate. This intention coincided with the plan of Colonel General von Conrad to clear Eastern Galicia of the enemy through a major offensive operation1). The Austro-Hungarian Chief of General Staff declared his agreement on August 11 and ordered the 2nd and Southern Army to prepare for the attack. However, this was not to take place until after the 18th, as the 1st Army, also designated to participate, was not yet operationally ready. On August 16, Colonel General von Conrad informed both army high commands2 that the \"preparatory operation on the inner flanks of the 2nd and Southern Army would only be carried out as part of a general attack, with the participation of the 4th Army2) on the armies of the Russian Southwestern Front.\"\n",

The three armies, having significantly improved their combat strength during the operational pause, would most likely be able to defeat the opposing enemy alone, or at least bind him and deprive him of the freedom to act.\n",
      "The Austro-Hungarian Army Command replied the next day that it had already been prompted by the same considerations to order the deployment of the 1st Army, reinforced by parts of the 4th Army, for a comprehensive attack against the right wing of the Russian Southwestern Front on August 19. For this purpose, an advance on Kowel was already underway and the assembly of strong forces between Wladimir Wolynsk and Kowel was being carried out.

      "At the same time, the 1st Army received instructions to group itself so that the attack could begin immediately, but in any case after the arrival of the XIV Corps in the area around Kowel (August 24). \"To protect the main thrust initially directed from the line Wladimir Wolynsk—Kowel generally towards Luzk,\" Kowel was to be firmly occupied by the Cavalry Corps Heydebreck (5th Cavalry Division, Austro-Hungarian 4th Cavalry Division, Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division) and an infantry division of the X Corps. For the attack on Luzk, this corps was to be positioned at Wladimir Wolynsk, the IX south of Turyski, and the XIV, brought up via Luboml, at Kowel. The group Smetal, advancing from the 4th Army (Austro-Hungarian 4th and Austrian 45th Infantry Division), was to be used as an army reserve as needed.\n",

In the 1st Army, the X and IX Corps were already positioned on the evening of the 28th, the right wing (II, I Corps, Szurmay Group) on the 29th before a continuous line of resistance stretching from Stojanow over Sadowa to Giernit. The XIV Corps threw back stronger enemy forces at Rozyszcze over the Styr on the 28th and advanced the next day between the Styr and the railway to Rowno into the area northwest of Riwnecy.

      "Generaloberst von Conrad had already repeatedly pointed out to Field Marshal von Puhallo during the course of August 28th that it was particularly important for the rapid capture of Luck and extensive encirclement to cross the Styr with a strong left wing downstream from Rozyszcze, where full freedom of action existed. Against the intention of the army commander to advance the XIV Corps on Luck on the 29th, but to let the X and IX Corps attack the Russian positions on the Styrna frontally only the next day, the Austro-Hungarian General Staff Chief again raised objections, because this would lead to a very favorable entrenchment for the enemy. Only by wide encirclement of the enemy's northern flank would the Styrna and Styr line on the Dubno—Luck stretch be made untenable. Therefore, strong forces should immediately advance over the Styr downstream from Luck to the east.\n",
      "Field Marshal von Puhallo then directed the XIV Corps against the area east of Luck and directed the 4th Cavalry Division to Rowno. The X Corps was withdrawn from the front on the night of the 30th; it was to cross the Styr point on the 31st at and north of Rozyszcze and advance southwards on September 1st. By this time, the Smefalu group and the 7th Cavalry Division could also appear on the southern bank, so that seven infantry and two cavalry divisions were available for use on the eastern bank of the Styr. The frontal attack of the remaining corps was postponed until the encirclement became effective.\n",
      "Thus, the XIV Corps advanced on August 30th against the Luck—Rowno road, with the 4th Cavalry Division advancing eastwards on both sides of the Rowno railway. Apparently under the pressure of these movements, the enemy evacuated his positions in front of the center and the right wing of the 1st Army during the following night and withdrew over the Styr. The II and IX Corps, as well as the Garnum group, followed on the 31st to the Styr Dubno—Montonowka line, with the XIV Corps establishing a connection with the troops of the Field Marshal's Office of Zibulka on the northern flank of the 2nd Army during the night of the 31st, reaching the Russian positions west of Radziechow and, following the retreating enemy closely, reached the Styr on the same day.

However, the center of the Southern Army, which was kept weak in favor of the assault wing, suffered a significant setback on August 30; a sharp Russian counterattack pushed it back with heavy losses in men and material to the area east of Rozwadow. The Rhemen Corps of the 7th Army also had to fend off heavy enemy attacks on the 31st.\n",
      "On the night of September 1, a reorganization of forces took place on the left wing of the army. The IX, X, and XIV Corps, the Smetal Group that had arrived in Holoby, as well as the 4th and the newly arrived 7th Cavalry Division, formed a new 4th Army under the command of Archduke Joseph Ferdinand, to whose directives the 1st Army was also bound during the ongoing operation. Already on the previous afternoon, Generaloberst von Conrad had pointed out to all armies that the offensive aimed not only at clearing Eastern Galicia but also at delivering a decisive blow. While the 7th, Southern, and 2nd Armies were essentially forced into frontal attacks, the 1st and 4th Armies, by concentrating strong forces on the northern flank, were in a position to attack the right flank of the Russian Southwestern Front and effectively threaten the enemy forces to the south. Since the enemy could most easily assemble strong forces around Rowno by utilizing his railways, rapid advancement in this direction was advised. The 1st Army was to take Dubno immediately; the position on the upper Styr was not to be attacked frontally but bypassed via Krzemieniec and to the south.\n",
      "Accordingly, the 1st and 4th Armies continued their advance on Dubno and Rowno on September 1. The next day, the enemy positioned himself along the Kozin—Murawica—Olka line and behind Putilowka; on the 3rd, he launched heavy counterattacks, forcing the right wing of the 1st Army to retreat significantly. During this and the following two days, they managed to regain some of the lost ground, and although the northern adjacent corps (I, Szurmay, IX, XIV) struggled in vain to dislodge the enemy from his positions, the X Corps deployed on the northern flank of the 4th Army reached the area southwest of Derazno by September 5 and crossed with parts west of Cuman the Putilowka.\n",

However, as the Putilowka lowland downwards Cuman had become almost impassable due to continuous rain, Archduke Joseph Ferdinand abandoned the encirclement and, through the group Smetal, reinforced the X Corps southwest of Cuman to break through to Klewan.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the 4th and 7th Cavalry Divisions, combined into the Berndt Cavalry Corps, had to turn north against strong Russian cavalry, which had already been advancing since September 2 south of the Sarny—Kowel railway against the flank and rear of the 4th Army. Against this new enemy, the 1st Cavalry Division provided by the 2nd Army and the Polish Legion (1st and 3rd Brigade) just west of Kowel had also been set in motion. Furthermore, Generaloberst von Conrad had agreed with General von Falkenhayn on the evening of September 2 to send the 2nd and 9th Cavalry Divisions, part of the German 9th Army, over Brest Litowsk to Kowel, and ordered the 7th Army to transport the 10th Cavalry Division there as well. On the night of the 6th, General von Falkenhayn finally agreed to the relocation of the Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division from the Bug Army to the area around Kamien Koszyrski. The Berndt Cavalry Corps occupied the Nomin crossings at Bereftany and Garajmontka on September 5 after fighting, repelled stronger enemy forces at Kolki over the Styr on the 7th, and advanced in the Romin-Styr angle to Kultkowicze in the following days. The 1st Cavalry Division pushed the enemy north of the Styr back to Zartorysk and Olszuf, and the Polish Legion forced the Russian cavalry, which had advanced to Kowel, to retreat behind the Stochod. Thus, the dangerous threat to the rear seemed happily eliminated.\n",
      "The northern wing of the 4th Army could only resume the attack on September 8 due to the strong fatigue of the troops. The reinforced X Corps broke through the enemy positions southwest of Cuman. At night, the enemy also evacuated the front adjoining to the south. In pursuit, the 4th Army reached the Stubla on the 9th, behind which the enemy had settled again, and the left wing of the 1st Army came to a halt in the line Iwanie—Moszkow.

Under the influence of Generaloberst von Conrad, who hoped that the vigorous continuation of the offensive on Rowno would relieve the armies in distress in Eastern Galicia, Archduke Joseph Ferdinand attempted to bring down the new Russian front again by encircling it from the north. He left only the 24th Infantry Division at the Stubla downwards Klewan and had the remaining four divisions of the X Corps advance from the northern bank of the Putilowka against the Goryn. They took Derzno on the 10th and established a foothold south of the Goryn bend, but then encountered the fiercest resistance. The left wing of the 1st Army (I Corps and Group Szurmay) advancing southwards also made slow progress. The Archduke weakened the Stubla front by three more divisions, one of which he made available to the 1st Army, the other two to the X Corps.

Nevertheless, General Count von Bothmer still hoped to carry out his attack on the bridgehead of Tarnopol the next morning, from which a relief of the Hofmann Corps was most expected. But when its left wing (the Austro-Hungarian combined Brigade Bolzano) was attacked again and completely broken through in the early morning of September 7, and the adjacent fronts saw themselves seriously threatened on their flanks, the planned operation had to be postponed in favor of the more urgent task of stemming the enemy breakthrough. General Freiherr Marschall had parts of the 3rd Guard Infantry and the 48th Reserve Division advance southeast from Chodaczow Wielki; they drove the enemy back to Nastaszow during the day and were able to recapture six German and Austro-Hungarian batteries lost in the morning.

General Freiherr von Pflanzer-Baltin, who had already reinforced the Rhemen Corps on the two previous days with one and a half cavalry divisions from the Henriques and Benigni groups, also had the Hungarian 37th Infantry Division, assigned to him by the army command and in the process of unloading at Nizinow, transported to Buczacz by motor vehicles from the morning of the 10th; parts of the division, however, had to be moved to the Zalessczyki bridgehead to join the Henriques group in the evening. To ensure the defense against the enemy incursion and to regain the Sereth line, the Austro-Hungarian VI Corps, originally intended for transport to southern Hungary, was to be relocated from Rawa Ruska to Nizinow and Halicz from September 11 onwards.\n",
      "The 7th Army thus had sufficient forces to prevent a new setback. In contrast, the Southern Army, against which the Russian counteroffensive was primarily directed, lacked any reserves. Its left wing had been engaged in the fiercest defensive battle on September 10. It had still managed to hold the positions overall. Whether this would continue to be possible with the continuation of the enemy attack was particularly questionable in view of the heavily battered Austro-Hungarian 19th Infantry Division. General Count Bothmer found it necessary to return half of the Hungarian 38th Infantry Division to the western bank of the Sereth within the XIX Corps to have at least a weak reserve behind his northern flank. Since it was not immediately possible to release them from the combat zone of the 2nd Army, General von Böhm-Ermolli initially provided the Marschall Corps with a regiment of the Hungarian 51st Infantry Division. It arrived just in time on September 11, to join forces with parts of the heavily attacked 3rd Guard Infantry and 48th Reserve Divisions to launch a counterattack against the enemy, who had broken through in a broad front at Dolzanka in the morning.</body>\n",

Although the previous positions of the Austro-Hungarian 19th Infantry Division were retaken in the evening, the High Command of the Southern Army believed that the breakthrough apparently sought by the Russians, especially near Tarnopol¹), could only be permanently thwarted by bringing in sufficient reinforcements. The Austro-Hungarian Army Command referred to support from the 2nd Army, which could also provide it with two divisions under Field Marshal Lieutenant Cibulka²), as the relief attack of its right wing had meanwhile come to a halt.\n",
      "New powerful attacks by the enemy on September 12, mainly directed against the bent-back right wing of the Marschall Corps, raised fears that the proven German divisions of General Freiherr Marschall might also be put in severe distress if they remained in their positions, especially since the enemy was nowhere seriously tied down on the southern adjoining front. General Count Bothmer therefore decided, with the approval of the General of the Marschall Corps, to withdraw to the heights east of the Wosuszka on the night of September 13 and to designate a reinforced brigade of the 48th Reserve Division as army reserve. To support the Hofmann Corps, Generaloberst von Conrad transferred the Hungarian 39th Infantry Division to the Southern Army, from whose position the Hungarian 37th Infantry Division joined the VI Corps.\n",
      "The severe setback suffered by the 7th and Southern Army in recent days, the stalling of the offensive on the rest of the right wing's front, and the heavy attacks that the enemy had been directing against the southern wing of the 2nd Army since the afternoon of September 11, created a completely changed situation for the Austro-Hungarian Army Command. Generaloberst von Conrad could not escape the representations made by General von Falkenhayn on the afternoon of September 12, that a further unfavorable development of the fighting in Eastern Galicia would adversely affect the overall situation and that relief could only be hoped for by abandoning the continuation of the offensive and resolutely transitioning to defense. He therefore ordered Archduke Joseph Ferdinand on the late evening of September 12, only to carry out the partial attack planned on the northern flank of the 4th Army,</body>\n",

      "The failure of the relief attack by the 7th Army led General Count von Bothmer to fear another breakthrough by the enemy at the Hofmann Corps. On the morning of September 17, it surprisingly turned out that the enemy had retreated during the night in front of the entire front of the 7th and Southern Army to the Sereth. This finally allowed the severe crisis into which both armies had fallen to be considered overcome. During the day, the Strypa bridgeheads were reoccupied by the Hofmann Corps, and the Wischä Heights north of Zalesszyki by the Henriques Group. Otherwise, only weak detachments followed the enemy on the orders of the army command. Generaloberst von Conrad did not intend to resume the offensive in Eastern Galicia for the time being, considering the overall situation. The current positions were to be expanded instead. The 39th Infantry Division was reassigned to the 7th Army, which had to extend its left wing to the south of Burkanow. The Southern Army detached the 3rd Guard Infantry Division as an army reserve from the Marschall Corps, which had also included the Austro-Hungarian 32nd Infantry Division¹) since September 14. The Czbullka Group Command returned to the 2nd Army, which in recent days had not only repelled all enemy assaults but, with the help of the 26th Infantry Division²) that had meanwhile arrived, had even regained part of the lost ground east of Lopuszno.\n",
      "Meanwhile, a fundamental change in the situation had also occurred on the northern wing of the Austro-Hungarian front. The left wing of the 4th Army (the X Corps) had, according to the orders of the army command from the evening of September 12, initially continued the attack and on the 13th was able to advance north of the Goryn to beyond Posjolno; however, it was then pushed into defense and attacked on the 15th by superior Russian forces in the front and left flank. Consequently, the X Corps had to be bent back into the line Klewan—Karpilowka at night.</body>\n",

As holding this line until reinforcements arrived seemed uncertain due to troop exhaustion, Archduke Joseph Ferdinand ordered the withdrawal of the 1st and 4th Armies behind Styr and Stochod for the coming night.

However, the allied army commands had agreed to hold the current front due to the unfavorable moral effects of a retreat.

      "In the afternoon of September 17, before the withdrawal of the northern wing of the Austro-Hungarian front behind Styr and Styr, Generaloberst von Conrad approached the German High Command with the request to direct all forces freed after gaining the area around Pinsk \"via Lubiaz—Kolk into the flank of the enemy attacking the 4th Army.\" Consequently, General von Falkenhayn instructed the leader of the Bug Army, General von Linsingen, to move two divisions in time to the area around Brodnica so that they could, if necessary, begin the march south together with the 5th Cavalry Division on September 19. With Generaloberst von Conrad, the consolidation of these forces, the cavalry corps Hauer and Herberstein, as well as the 4th Army into Army Group Linsingen was agreed upon, which was to be bound to the instructions of the Austro-Hungarian High Command. General von Linsingen designated the 1st and 22nd Infantry Divisions under the command of the XXIV Reserve Corps (General of Infantry von Gerok) for the new operation. However, their deployment in the area around Brodnica was delayed by one day because the supply of the troops with provisions and ammunition for the near future could not be accomplished sooner. From the XXXXI Reserve Corps, whose command was taken over by General of Artillery von Gronau, the 82nd Reserve Division occupied the entire security line of the Bug Army, which had meanwhile advanced beyond the Styr to the Wisłiza, while the 81st Reserve Division was withdrawn as a reserve to the area west of Pinsk. The corps remained under General von Linsingen as the \"Bug Army\" and was also referred to in official army reports as \"Army Group Mackensen\" for deception purposes.\n",
      "General von Linsingen received the order to \"prevent the further advance of the northern wing of the Russian forces south of the Pripjet.\" General von Linsingen, in agreement with Generaloberst von Conrad, saw it as his task not to begin the further retreat of the 4th Army unconditionally, but to deliver a decisive blow to the northern wing of the Russian Southwestern Front. Given the precarious condition of Archduke Joseph Ferdinand's troops, he believed a significant reinforcement by German forces was necessary for this. However, given the overall situation, this was out of the question. General</body>\n",

      "<body>von Linsingen therefore received only the order to \"prevent the further advance of the northern wing of the Russian forces south of the Pripjet.\" He was given full freedom of action for the execution. The assumption of command over the new army group took place on the night of September 20. From the available reports, General von Linsingen gained the impression that the enemy attacks against the northern wing of the allies, in which only the Russian XII, XXXIX, and the repeatedly defeated XXX Corps, as well as two cavalry corps, seemed to be involved, were by no means a real offensive, but rather one of the usual Russian military maneuvers to disguise defensive intentions. He therefore decided to solve his task offensively, even without further reinforcement, by advancing the Gerok Corps and three divisions to be withdrawn from the front of the 4th Army against the enemy's right flank. For this purpose, the two Austro-Hungarian cavalry corps and the German 5th Cavalry Division were to clear the area between Stochod and Styr of the enemy and block the Styr crossings, the Gerok Corps was to have arrived at Liszniowka by September 22, the 4th Army was to prepare three divisions behind its left wing to hold its positions against \"an enemy inferior in number and inner value\" under all circumstances. Since Archduke Joseph Ferdinand did not have sufficient reserves to form the assault group, Generaloberst von Conrad subordinated to him from September 21 the Austro-Hungarian 11th Infantry Division along with the corps command of the XVII Corps.\n",
      "On September 20, the Gerok Corps began its advance south. The 5th Cavalry Division had already crossed the Stochod at Lubieszow the day before and driven enemy outposts from Jeleznica and Sudcze. Now the Hauer Cavalry Corps also advanced eastward. The 4th and 1st Armies initially followed the enemy only hesitantly, but from the afternoon of September 19, they had attacked the bridgehead of Lucz with strong forces. In the following two nights, all enemy assaults could be repelled, but in the early morning of September 23, they succeeded in breaking through the northern front, seizing a Styr bridge, and gaining a foothold on the west bank.</body>\n",

Consequently, Luz had to be abandoned, and the XIV Corps had to be withdrawn to the line Polama Gorta—Stiernit. Archduke Joseph Ferdinand considered the situation so serious that he ordered the march of the divisions intended for the planned flank attack (Austrian 13th and 21st Infantry Divisions, and the 11th Infantry Division of the XVII Corps) northward and further requested the assignment of the Hungarian 41st Infantry Division, which had meanwhile been moved forward to Gorodok, which was promptly granted. He made the 21st Infantry Division available to the XIV Corps, intending to use the other three for a concentric counterattack the next day, which would have made their simultaneous deployment behind the Herberstein Cavalry Corps impossible.\n",
      "General von Linsingen received detailed reports about the events at Luz only on the night of September 24, when he returned to his headquarters in Tablon (60 kilometers southwest of Brest Litowsk) from a trip to Kowel. At the same time, he learned more about a setback at the German XXXXI Reserve Corps; its left wing had to defend itself against heavy attacks by superior forces east of Logiszin since September 21 and finally had to retreat behind the Jasiolda and Dsjinski Canal on the 23rd with considerable losses. Also, southwest of Pinsk, near Nemez, the German defenses had been pushed back northward. Despite these unfavorable reports, General von Linsingen saw no cause for serious concern. He did not believe in a superior Russian attack on the Pinsk peninsula and trusted that even for the weak, over 60 kilometers apart forces of the XXXXI Reserve Corps in the impassable, water-rich terrain, it must be possible to prevent further enemy advances. But even if this did not succeed, he did not consider the overall situation to be immediately endangered. He also did not share Archduke Joseph Ferdinand's concerns about the situation at Luz. Incidentally, the command of the 4th Army had meanwhile become calm, as the enemy had not advanced further from the western Styr bank. General von Linsingen therefore decided that the 11th and 41st Infantry Divisions should continue their march northward; only the 13th Infantry Division should remain behind the left wing of the XIV Corps for the time being, but also only be deployed there in an emergency.</body>\n",

General von Linsingen also decided to refrain from advancing over Putilowka, Korimin, and Styr and to expand the reached lines as a permanent position; the cavalry corps Heydebreck was to limit itself to clearing the left bank of the Wiesielucha. However, the army command and army group were united in the desire to resume the offensive against Rowno around the railway junction Sarny, whose possession they considered important for the permanent control of the area gained in the southeast, after replenishing the troops and forming a strong strike group on the northern flank of General von Gerok. Generaloberst von Conrad then hoped to involve the East Galician front in this offensive. The German Chief of General Staff also considered it very desirable for the general situation in the East to keep the Russians under pressure, which, given the circumstances, would probably only be possible south of the Pripjet. However, he pointed out that an offensive starting only in the second half of October would likely encounter equally strong forces that had been brought up in the meantime, and he doubted whether the advanced season would allow for larger operations in the Rowno—Sarny area. He therefore suggested refraining from further attacks and requested, with reference to the strong German deployment against Serbia, to release the German forces provided for the operation in Volhynia or equivalent Austro-Hungarian forces for the front north of the Pripjet as well as the German Alpine Corps in Tyrol for the Western Front. The question of whether Army Group Linsingen would attack again or not was to be decided by Generaloberst von Conrad around mid-October. At this point, he also hoped to make up for the setback on the German Eastern Front. However, he immediately initiated the replacement of the Alpine Corps.\n",

General von Linsingen formed a new assault group north of Kolki from the Austro-Hungarian 11th and the German 1st Infantry Division under General von Conta1) and launched it on October 5 for a counterattack in a northeasterly direction. According to their progress, the Hauer Cavalry Corps was to concentrate strong forces on its left wing and advance on Holuzki. However, the Conta group initially made slow progress in the impassable swamp and forest terrain; it was not until October 8 that the enemy was pushed back over the Stryr between Czartorysk and Kolodziesje. General Freiherr von Hauer had meanwhile had to swing north, as parts of the Russian Cavalry Corps Belaschanow had broken through at Jeziere on the 6th and advanced to Rudka Czerwiszcze the following day. On October 9, they were even able to advance southwards to Karasin. However, when half of the Austro-Hungarian 11th Infantry Division took Rudka the next day and the Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division2) approached Jeziere from the north to close proximity, the enemy avoided the impending encirclement by hastily retreating to the northeast. On October 10, the 5th Cavalry Division finally succeeded in driving the enemy out of Kuchecka Wola and from the left bank of the Wieśleucha. This success probably only served to intimidate, as parts of the XXXI Reserve Corps, which had been relieved in the front on both sides of Pinsk by the Guard Cavalry Division transferred by the Woyrsch Army Detachment at the beginning of October, had meanwhile pushed the enemy standing at Newel back over Sinczyce.\n",

As the southern adjoining front was also breached in several places, the commander of the Southwestern Front, General Ivanov, decided to withdraw his three original units on the 28th to the line Siernitza (northwest of Luzk)—Radziechow—Uscilug around the Strypa. To the particularly endangered right wing of the army, he quickly assigned two divisions from the 11th and 9th Armies, consolidated into the XXXIX Corps.

At the same time, a new encirclement operation by German forces advancing from the north on Kolki became noticeable. While the 4th Cavalry Corps of the 3rd Army (three cavalry divisions) advanced to the Stochod, it gradually withdrew to the Wiesielucha and the Styr, General Brussilow timely withdrew his northern flank from the impending danger by retreating to the Kormin and behind the Putilowka, where he withstood all assaults.\n",
      "By the end of September, the Russian military leadership no longer considered the situation on the southwestern front as threatened. The Chief of General Staff, General Alexeyev, pointed out that the right wing of the 8th Army could be strengthened by detachments from the 9th Army and by bringing in the 125th Infantry Division from the Starokonstantinov—Proskurov area, so that it could counter any enemy encirclement attempt east of Rovno. Consequently, General Ivanov moved a division of the 9th Army to the area northwest of Rovno and ordered his armies to weaken the enemy further through short advances before he could reorganize and replenish his depleted units. As an introduction to this, the 4th Cavalry Corps, reinforced by an infantry division of the 3rd Army, together with the two cavalry divisions of General Welsaschen, which had been moved north, and to which a regiment of the 4th Rifle Division was attached, crossed the Styr on both sides of the Sarny—Rovno railway on October 4 and pushed the Austro-Hungarian cavalry back to and over the Nowosilki—Rudka Czerniszce road.

      "Generaloberst von Conrad had pursued the goal with the autumn offensive of the Austro-Hungarian army in Galicia and Volhynia to decisively defeat the Russian southwestern front, capture the fortress of Rowno, and clear the remaining Galician territory still in enemy hands. This goal was not only not achieved, the offensive ended after promising beginnings with a severe setback and extraordinarily large losses in men¹), in some places also in material²). From the beginning, the attacker was numerically far superior on the decisive northern wing — the Russian 8th Army with 9 infantry and 3½ cavalry divisions faced at the end of August the Austro-Hungarian 1st and 2nd Army with 24½ infantry and 3½ cavalry divisions. Also, in overall strength, the Allies had a considerable superiority with 38 Austro-Hungarian and German infantry divisions and 8½ cavalry divisions, which was further increased during the operation by the deployment of five more divisions (Hungarian 37th, 39th, and 41st, Austro-Hungarian 11th and 12th Infantry Division³).\n",
      "If the offensive nevertheless ended in failure, the reasons may lie partly in the deployment of forces, which was not sufficient to encircle the enemy's northern wing. On the other hand, the impassable, water-rich forest and swamp terrain of Volhynia, especially in unfavorable weather conditions — from September 3rd, continuous rain caused particular difficulties for the movements of large troop formations and the supply lines.</body>\n",
      "<footer>¹) According to \"Austria-Hungary's Last War 1914—1918\", Vol. III, p. 163, the Austro-Hungarian Northern Army (7th, Austro-Hungarian 2nd, 1st, and 4th Army), whose combat strength was 480,000 men on September 1st, had a loss of about 230,000 men by the end of the month (including 40,000 sick), including 109,000 missing, who according to Russian reports were almost entirely captured. Of these, 17,800 dead and wounded, 3,900 sick, and 13,300 missing were attributed to the Southern Army. It faced the Southern Army itself before the start of the offensive until the end of September with approximately 11,600 prisoners and 17 machine guns.\n",

      "<body>Rain — the movements of large troop bodies and the supply faced particular difficulties. More significant is the fact that the divisions deployed for the decisive blow on the northern flank had participated in the advance of the allies from West Galicia to Brest Litowsk since early May and had covered many hundreds of kilometers on mostly poor roads while constantly fighting. They were exhausted and had to muster their entire combat strength for the new offensive, where they were again expected to perform at their highest. The Austro-Hungarian units in East Galicia, after the hardships of the Carpathian winter and the months of strenuous and costly battles that led them to the Zlota Lipa, no longer had sufficient offensive power to finally drive the tenacious enemy, skilled in conducting a retreat, from the Galician soil, as the terrain offered favorable defensive possibilities in the numerous tributaries of the Dniester running parallel to the south.\n",
      "After the retreat of the Austro-Hungarian left wing behind the Etwa and the Styr in mid-September, General von Linsingen, with relatively small but also very strained forces advancing from the most favorable direction, was able to restore the balance with difficulty, but he too was denied a decisive blow against the northern flank of the Russian Southwestern Front, as it managed to evade the threatening encirclement in time and extend its front northwards.\n",
      "The failure of the offensive had an adverse effect on the overall situation of the allies, as the Austro-Hungarian Northern Army emerged from it significantly weakened, and the German Supreme Army Command was forced to bring in additional German forces from the eastern and western fronts to replace the Austro-Hungarian VI and XVII Corps, which had to be deployed in the ongoing operations in East Galicia and Volhynia and were tied down there.</body>\n",

      "<body>Map 7, Sketch 32.\n",
      "When the battles in East Galicia and Volhynia concluded with the expulsion of the enemy from the western Styrpa and Styr banks, Generaloberst von Conrad directed the Austro-Hungarian 7th and the Southern Army as well as the Böhm-Ermolli army groups (Austro-Hungarian 2nd and 1st Army) and Linsingen (Austro-Hungarian 4th Army, Groups Gerok and Gronau) to ensure that the overall situation, \"especially the still unclear development of matters on the Balkan Peninsula and at the Romanian border,\" required the secure holding of the permanent position to be expanded by all means.</body>\n",

After integrating new replacements, strong army reserves were to be set aside to repel possible Russian attacks or for use on other fronts.\n",
      "Before the Linsingen Army Group could begin expanding the achieved line, it was hit by a new attack. On October 16, strong forces — a total of 5½ infantry and 4½ cavalry divisions of the inner flanks of the Russian 8th and 3rd Army — advanced against the positions of the Gerok Group between Karpilowka and Jezierzce, aiming to shorten the front by capturing the Styr bend from Czartorysk and Kolki. The next day, the enemy, due to the failure of the unreliable Ruthenian 22nd Brigade of the Austro-Hungarian 11th Infantry Division, managed to seize the well-fortified bridgehead of Kullikowicze and gain the left bank of the Styr at Rafalowka. The 1st Infantry Division, thus encircled on both sides, had to be withdrawn from the Styr bend on October 18, suffering significant losses in men and material, and on the 19th, even had to bend its right flank back to Olyka. From here to the Styr at Kolki, there was a 16-kilometer-wide gap into which the particularly proven rifle divisions of the Russian XXXX Corps pushed. North of the Conta Corps, the Sauer Cavalry Corps retreated to the Holszia-Jezierzce line before a superior enemy.\n",
      "General von Linsingen had already taken care on October 18 to stem the enemy incursion by bringing up available reserves. On the 20th, parts of the German 22nd Infantry Division and the Austrian 21st Infantry Division, rushed from the left flank of the 4th Army, advanced from Kolki, with the Austro-Hungarian 10th Cavalry Division from the area east of Nawoz, the Polish Legion (1st and 3rd Brigade) from the west, and the 1st Infantry Division from the north for a concentric counterattack, which pushed the tip of the Russian wedge back over ten kilometers, but then stalled.</body>\n",

Only after a three-day pause, used to form a strike group with the 1st Infantry Division, could a powerful blow be dealt to the enemy on November 13, forcing them to evacuate the western bank of the Styr south of the Rowel—Sarny railway the following night. The left wing of the Conta Corps and the Hauer Cavalry Corps did not advance to the Styr again but entrenched themselves along the Kolodzjeje—Jezierec line. Meanwhile, fighting resumed with the Böhm-Ermolli Army Group and the Southern Army. On October 21, the right wing corps (VII) of the Russian 11th Army unexpectedly attacked the right wing of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army and threw them out of their forward positions near and north of Nowe Alekziniec. The situation was quickly restored by deploying reserves. More dangerous were renewed breakthrough attempts by the enemy at the Strypa. There, the Russian XXII Corps succeeded on October 31 in capturing the bridgehead of Siemikowce and occupying the village on the right bank. Only after five days of extremely bloody fighting, involving troops from the Russian XVIII and VI Corps, could the enemy be pushed back to their original positions by the Hungarian 38th Infantry Division and parts of the 3rd Guard, 48th Reserve, and Austro-Hungarian 55th Infantry Division. The losses on both sides were unusually high; in the Southern Army, they amounted to 2000 dead, 4500 wounded, and 3200 missing, while the Russians left almost 6300 prisoners in the hands of the Allies.\n",

Only then could the Austro-Hungarian Northern Army and the Linsingen Army Group begin to organize the extremely fragmented units and prepare for new military requirements. The Austro-Hungarian 7th Army received after the transfer of 1½ infantry divisions each to the southwestern front and the Linsingen Army Group for its approximately 150-kilometer-wide section at the beginning of December, still over 7½ infantry and 4 cavalry divisions, the Southern Army with a front width of around 60 kilometers over 5½ infantry divisions.</body>\n",

      "On September 5, the Tsar arrived at the Grand Headquarters in Mogilev and, with General Alexeyev as Chief of Staff, took command of all land and naval forces at the front. The announcement stated: \"With unwavering faith in ultimate victory, we will fulfill our sacred duty to defend the homeland to the utmost.\" Given the disintegration that the previous supreme commander, Grand Duke Nicholas, enjoyed in the widest circles, the people, army, and allies did not welcome this change with unreserved joy and increased confidence²). All attempts to dissuade the Tsar from his plan had failed. On the other hand, General Alexeyev, due to his military past, enjoyed particularly high esteem³).\n",
      "The army group of the Northern Front under General Russki, which also included the Baltic Fleet, held the Dvina line at the beginning of September with strong bridgeheads on the western bank; the 10th Army had been \"under the compulsion\" of the German advance between Dvinsk and Vilna and had already been transferred to the Western Front by the end of August. The Western Front under General Ewergt, the previous commander of the 4th Army, stood with the 10th, 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 3rd Armies in a line running from west of Vilna east past Grodno to the south. Its left wing, the 3rd Army, had particularly felt the pressure of the German Army Detachment Woyrsch and the Mackensen Army Group in the last days of August, which had pushed them back to Pruzana and Pinsk. After Grodno was evacuated on September 2 before the attack of the German 8th Army⁴), stubborn battles developed to the east. The main concern was directed at the northern flank threatened by encirclement near Vilna; the previously reported reserves were soon to be consolidated into a new 2nd Army to close the gap at Swenzjany. The Southwestern Front under General Ivanov (8th, 11th, and 9th Armies) was forced to retreat before the advancing enemy into a line running east of the Styr and then along the Sereth to the south, thus still holding Austrian territory with its southern flank.\n",

However, the Russian Supreme Command had already assigned only local significance to the battles in this theater of war for some time. The armies of the Southwestern Front served primarily as a source for strengthening the northern fronts, to which they had already transferred 13½ divisions from June to the end of August and were to transfer four more; thus, since mid-July, they had been weakened by 40 percent of their strength overall.\n",
      "The new Supreme Command could not change the overall situation; initially, it could only try to slow down the pace of the retreat. In its first directive, issued on September 8, it stated that the strength of the enemy attacks along the entire front had diminished; the enemy was following with partly strong advance guards mainly along the roads; this had to be taken into account in the defense. Rapid evasion had to be avoided to ensure the return of supplies and refugees.\n",
      "When the German attack, which began on September 9 northwest of Vilna, grew into an extremely threatening encirclement of the northern wing of the Western Front1), the Supreme Command had to order the retreat of this front to the line Michaliszki—Nowogrodek—Baranowicze—Dsjunkf Canal on September 17. It also hoped for only a restoration, but no decisive change in the situation, from the new 2nd Army, which was meanwhile gathering west of Molodetschno. Thus, on September 22, the further retreat to the line Narocz Lake—Smorgon and south was already ordered, so that the front finally ran just east of Baranowicze and Pinsk.\n",

But when the Western powers launched a major relief attack in France at the end of September, the Russians also attacked again, hoping to win Romania for themselves and help Serbia, which the Tsar's government had advised to be uncompromising against Austria-Hungary in the decisive days of July 1914.\n",

That their attack brought a considerable booty of more than 70,000 prisoners and 37 guns and in October also achieved a success at Baranowicze, despite the defeat in the north and later setback at Luck, boosted the confidence of the Supreme Command. It gradually became clear that the German command had begun to transfer numerous units that had previously fought against Russia to other fronts. By October, seven divisions had been counted that had gone west, nine that had been sent to the Balkans. It was also observed since mid-October that less effective ammunition was being fired from the enemy side3). With the decline of combat activity, the construction of strong positions and preparations for winter began on the entire Russian front, just as on the Austro-Hungarian and German fronts.

      "On May 21, the Chiefs of Staff of the Central Powers agreed to continue focusing the main efforts of the war on the Galician theater and to remain defensive on the other fronts1). General von Falkenhayn adhered unwaveringly to this decision in the following months despite Italy's entry into the war and the occasionally crisis-like tense situation at the Dardanelles and especially on the Western Front.\n",
      "With the growing successes on the eastern theater of war, the operational goal here was increasingly expanded. During the Galician operation, the initial limited task was to relieve the Austro-Hungarian Carpathian front from Russian pressure, but after reaching the Wisłok, the pursuit was continued to the San to \"deliver a blow to the enemy that could not be reciprocated\"; thereafter, operations against the enemy east of the San were to continue \"until a decision sufficient for our purposes\"2), i.e., until the final defeat of the Russian offensive power in Galicia. Finally, in unified cooperation of the Austro-Hungarian and German Eastern Front, the defeat of the main enemy forces in Poland and thus the \"campaign decision\" against Russia was sought. Under these circumstances, it was clear that the East gradually demanded all available forces from the other theaters of war. With the increasing troop requirements of the Eastern Front, both Chiefs of Staff did not shy away from the risk of stripping the German Western Army and the Serbian front of forces to the limit of what was possible. From mid-April to the first half of August, no fewer than 14½ infantry and reserve divisions from the West and the German divisions from the Serbian front, a total of 17½ divisions, were moved to the Russian theater; specifically from the Western Front: 2½ on April 14, eight divisions, on May 3 one division, on June 2, 2½, on July 19 two divisions, and on August 8 one division. Of these, only two were transported back to the western theater of war.\n",

      "All demands exceeding a minimum from the other theaters of war had to be temporarily postponed due to the growing need for forces in the East. The start of the campaign against Serbia, which was urgently demanded and repeatedly considered due to the difficult situation of the Ottoman Empire, had to be postponed again and again. Thus, the path to the Orient for supporting Turkey, which was engaged in heavy attrition battles on Gallipoli, remained blocked.\n",
      "With even greater emphasis, however, the diplomatic struggle continued after Italy's entry into the war to prepare a final solution to the extremely difficult and significant Balkan problem for the overall conduct of the war; for there was a danger that after Italy, the neutral Balkan states would also turn to the enemy camp. The accession of the last European great power to the enemy alliance, the difficult situation at the Dardanelles, and the tension between the United States of America and Germany caused by the sinking of the \"Lusitania\" meant a considerable burden on the Central Powers from the standpoint of the Balkan states, despite all the successes of the allies on the Galician front. The sharp contrasts that arose in the recently initiated negotiations between Bulgaria and Turkey due to excessive Bulgarian demands could also be seen as a worrying sign of an unfavorable development of affairs. Similarly, the increased resistance to continuing neutrality, which was asserted by the Romanian government, could be interpreted. This renewed suspicion that Romania was bound by contractual agreements to follow Italy's actions.\n",
      "Above all, it was the uncertainty of the Balkan situation that brought the leading statesmen and chiefs of staff of the Central Powers together for a meeting at the German Great Headquarters in Pleß on May 25. The focus was on exchanging views about Romania's stance. According to the General's opinion, the efforts of the allies had to be incessantly directed towards securing Romania by assuring military and economic guarantees.</body>\n",

It was unanimously agreed that it was necessary to bridge the differences between Bulgaria and Turkey. The hope for an agreement between these two states seemed present, as the High Porte, according to recently received reports, did not reject a territorial concession to Bulgaria up to the Maritza line and only demanded the conclusion of an alliance with Bulgaria in return. If it was possible to reach an agreement on these issues, the first condition for the creation of a \"Balkan League\" was fulfilled, whose establishment General von Falkenhayn again suggested during the course of discussions; as a further prerequisite for this, he strongly advocated the understanding between Austria-Hungary and Serbia.\n",
      "The uncertainty of the political situation was further heightened by alarm reports from the Dardanelles. On June 9, the German ambassador, Baron von Wangenheim, reported from Constantinople that the recent land attacks by Anglo-French forces on Gallipoli had extraordinarily shaken the Turkish resistance. The enemy artillery had gained considerable superiority, and Turkish ammunition production could no longer keep pace with consumption. \"Under all these circumstances, the fall of the Dardanelles must be expected unless it is possible to quickly reach an understanding with Romania that ensures the passage of ammunition... In my opinion, the Dardanelles cannot hold out for more than a month.\"\n",
      "Immediately thereafter — mid-June — the successful operation of the allies on the Galician front began to exert its moral impact on the Balkans to such an extent that the transfer of the larger part of the German troops stationed in southern Hungary to the Galician front seemed possible.\n",
      "This improvement in the situation was mainly due to the fact that the Entente did not succeed at that time in bringing Romania and Bulgaria to their side.

      "While the Reich leadership emphasized the urgent need to quickly subdue Serbia to finally provide the threatened ally with the necessary support1), the responsible leader of the German overall operations argued that the primary goal now was to fully exploit the victories over Russia. \"If Turkey can hold the straits for another five to six weeks,\" General von Falkenhayn replied to the Chancellor on July 6, \"then Russia's defeat will likely be so apparent that we can confidently expect a more favorable stance from the two Balkan states for our purposes.\"\n",
      "With these statements, General von Falkenhayn approached the view previously held by General von Conrad that, following the expected decisive successes over Russia, a Balkan campaign would no longer be necessary to secure the connection with Turkey. At this point, the German Supreme Army Command hoped that continuing the offensive in southern Poland, along with a simultaneous attack by the Gallwitz Army Group against the Narew2), would lead to Russia's military defeat and thus also the decision on the Balkans. Indicative of this view is the previously mentioned3) diary note by Generaloberst von Plessen from July 19, suggesting that the campaign in the East now seemed decided, and an assessment of the situation sent by General von Falkenhayn to the Chancellor on July 22, intended for communication to leading parliamentarians. In it, the Chief of the General Staff emphasized that the Serbian campaign, if the Russian power, as he hoped, was finally defeated, would probably become unnecessary, \"because under such an assumption, Romania and Bulgaria would no longer pose any difficulties for us4).\"\n",

To hold the straits, however, the subjugation of Serbia was necessary. General von Falkenhayn apparently expected a tangible conclusion to the operations against Russia in five to six weeks. By that time, it should be possible to provide the necessary forces against Serbia, amounting to 250,000 men. For the defense of the Dardanelles, this might already be too late; but even in this unfavorable case, the subjugation of Serbia remained necessary to win over Bulgaria, extend a hand to the Turks beleaguered in Thrace, and, if possible, liberate Constantinople again.\n",

Further reassurance was provided by a letter from Field Marshal Freiherr von der Goltz dated July 8. The ammunition shortage continued, but \"everything must be done,\" he emphasized, \"that is compatible with the general interests of the alliance to provide us with supplies...

When Przemysl fell on June 3, and thus the San line was taken, he therefore requested the Chancellor, through the mediation of the representative of the Foreign Office at the Great Headquarters, the envoy von Treutler, to \"take advantage of the currently favorable situation of the campaign against Russia and make an attempt to reach a cessation of hostilities between us and Russia...\" He proposed to present the Tsar, through a neutral power, with the following: \"Przemysl is in our hands, the troops thus freed are moving on Lemberg, which must be taken in the foreseeable future. A new army will soon be deployed against the eastern front2). This military situation will not be changed by the possible, but in view of our successes unlikely, entry of Romania and Bulgaria3) into the war against us any more than the already completed entry of Italy has...

As early as September 1914, neutral European states had offered to mediate peace, but were rejected in Paris and London. In January 1915, American Colonel House was prompted by President Wilson to establish contact with the English and German governments to explore peace possibilities. He hoped to achieve that both parties would initially be willing to engage in mutual discussions. An essential prerequisite for this, however, was that Germany agreed to evacuate Belgium and to the plan of general disarmament of the powers. Colonel House arrived in Berlin at the end of March and held discussions with the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. However, without addressing the Belgian question, the issues that directly concerned the United States, such as American munitions deliveries to the Entente and the blockade imposed by England over Germany, were discussed more urgently. The question posed by Colonel House, whether the German government would be willing to join a new convention for securing the seas, was fundamentally agreed to by the Chancellor. However, following the sinking of the \"Lusitania\" by a German submarine on May 7, these discussions came to a temporary end.\n",
      "In addition to Colonel House's peace efforts, in the early months of 1915, a neutral European state attempted to establish contact between the warring powers to facilitate peace.

The Tsar indeed rejected the idea of a separate peace, but was otherwise not averse to entering into an exchange of ideas with Germany regarding peace through neutral mediation.

      "On the other hand, given the impending breakdown of relations between Vienna and Rome, as well as the various conflicts existing in the coastal area of the Adriatic between Italy and Serbia, May 1915 seemed to be the time to reach an understanding between the Danube Monarchy and Serbia. Therefore, in mid-May, it was suggested by Germany to the Austro-Hungarian government to conclude a separate peace with Serbia on the basis that the Negotin district would be ceded to Austria-Hungary, thereby securing an immediate connection with Bulgaria. In return, Serbia was to be granted Northern Albania and the merger with Montenegro. The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, Baron Burian, was not opposed to this endeavor but considered it desirable that the initiative come from the Serbian government. However, this was not achievable, as indicated by a letter from the Austro-Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to General von Conrad dated May 30: \"Burian wants to build golden bridges for them — the Serbs — but they do not come.\" Nevertheless, the idea of an approach by Austria-Hungary to Serbia from the German side was pursued further in the following weeks.</body>\n",

On the same day, he responded, pointing out the failure of his previous peace efforts, stating that based on the experiences gained, there was the greatest likelihood that the Tsar would decisively reject the proposed cessation of hostilities. Should this not be the case against expectations, the Tsar would condition the acceptance of the proposal on either us ceasing hostilities against all our opponents or the Russian forces not being used on any other theater of war. Furthermore, the Tsar would only provide the German government with any response to a clearly outlined proposal after consulting with his allies. \"Any proposal from us,\" emphasized the Chancellor, \"presupposes that we are ready to make peace with all our enemies based on the current war situation. That our opponents are inclined to do so seems doubtful to me after Italy's attack. In any case, peace would at best only be achievable on the basis of the status quo ante. Whether this path must be taken is subject solely to military assessment...\" The Chancellor concluded by expressing the thought that Germany was hardly in a position to offer the Russians significantly more than the Tsar hoped to achieve by remaining with the Entente. Moreover, Germany's peace proposals to Russia could be interpreted by Romania and Bulgaria as a sign of weakness; there was a danger that these states might switch to the camp of our opponents out of fear of being too late in the distribution of the spoils.\n",

A new occasion for this was provided by a letter from Generaloberst von Conrad dated July 21 to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Vienna. The current impressive military maneuver, it stated, which would likely soon lead to the capture of Lublin, Cholm, Iwangorod, and perhaps even Warsaw, should be used to break the enemy's bloc through an agreement with Russia and to neutralize Romania and Bulgaria. Golden bridges should be built for Russia for a separate peace.\n",

      "In his reply on July 30, the Chancellor pointed out that he had been thoroughly examining for months whether Russia was inclined towards a separate peace with Germany, but that the Russian government had so far consistently responded negatively. Although a shift in sentiment in favor of Germany was noticeable, there was no inclination towards a separate peace; rather, they adhered to the old position that Russia, bound by the word of the Tsar, could only make peace jointly with its allies. The severe defeats in Poland and Russia were not considered decisive for the final outcome of the war in Petersburg and were only regarded as temporary setbacks. With the deployment of British forces still in training, the great offensive of the Western powers would begin in the fall on the French front. Despite the undoubtedly noticeable shift in sentiment, it seemed unjustified to assume that Russia would decide on a separate peace even with favorable progress in our military operations in Poland. The possibility for this would, if at all, only arise when Russia had to finally abandon its hope for the fall of the Dardanelles¹) and the acquisition of Bulgaria.\n",

I also make it known there that the establishment of a prolonged German-Austrian administration in Congress Poland would so strengthen the Polish freedom and independence movement that Poland would have to be considered lost to Russia in one form or another.\" The Chancellor concluded with the remark that the Entente would view a German-Austrian peace offer as a sign of weakness despite our victories in Poland and would treat it accordingly, as long as hopes of subduing Turkey, annexing the Balkan states, and a breakthrough in the West persisted. \"Only when these prospects are eliminated will we be strong enough to extend our hand for peace if our opponents do not come.\"\n",
      "General von Falkenhayn's pursuit of an imminent peace also makes his plan to clear Upper Alsace, first expressed in mid-June, understandable, for which merely military reasons could hardly be asserted. General von Conrad had made similar considerations when he described the minimum goal of the Eastern operation in his letter of May 14 to General von Falkenhayn as: \"Regaining the territory of the monarchy and the territory of Russian Poland on the left bank of the Vistula, which is to be ceded to us as compensation for territorial concessions to Italy.\" General von Conrad had come close to this goal in mid-June when the capture of the capital of Galicia was not imminent. It is therefore probably no coincidence that at this time the German Chief of Staff also sought to recapture the last part of German soil in Upper Alsace still occupied by the enemy, so that in any peace negotiations there would be no more bargaining chips in enemy hands.\n",
      "How much General von Falkenhayn was counting on the possibility of peace at that time is also evident from the fact that he sent a memorandum prepared by the Supreme Army Command on \"the economic and military situation of France\" to both the Chancellor and the Foreign Office in early June, which concluded: \"France's sacrifices in this war are so enormous that the government will neither be able to bear the responsibility before the people nor before history, and will soon be faced with the question of whether abandoning resistance will serve the nation's future better than continuing the war, which is hopeless for France despite all external aid.\"</body>\n",

      "... of a peace with Russia. General von Falkenhayn had also fully recognized this. Both had therefore already been striving in recent weeks to leave no stone unturned to advance the stalled negotiations on Bulgaria's accession to the Central Powers. In the second half of July, their efforts—supported by the widely visible successes of the allied arms—finally seemed to be crowned with success. King Ferdinand of Bulgaria and Prime Minister Radoslawoff declared themselves ready to send an authorized officer to the German Great Headquarters to negotiate Bulgaria's participation in a campaign against Serbia.\n",
      "General von Falkenhayn received this news on July 24, at a time when he was still hoping for a major operational success against Russia. Consequently, he believed, albeit temporarily, that the Serbian campaign was no longer necessary and that the defeat of Russia would also successfully resolve the Balkan problem. The Bulgarian offer to participate in the military action against Serbia therefore seemed to him, although he had previously eagerly sought it, not particularly urgent at the moment. However, a few days later—at the beginning of August—reports from the battlefronts about the systematic retreat of the Russians on the entire front in Poland raised doubts in him as to whether the desired success of great operational impact would still be achievable, he welcomed the prospect of soon reaching a conclusion with Bulgaria. Generaloberst von Conrad was initially reserved about this plan, which was primarily due to German efforts1). Not entirely unjustly, he feared it would damage the prestige of the Danube Monarchy in the Balkans. He would have preferred to deploy all forces until the complete defeat of Russia in the East, thereby drawing Serbia over to Austria-Hungary and simultaneously gaining a free hand for an offensive against Italy. On the other hand, he did not entirely close himself off to the realization that the war situation on the Russian front at this time offered little hope for the realization of his far-reaching plans and that any increase in strength for the Central Powers was to be welcomed from the standpoint of overall war strategy.\n",

      "<body>There were tense plans and every increase in strength for the Central Powers was to be welcomed from the standpoint of overall war leadership. Therefore, he agreed with the start of negotiations on Bulgaria's participation in the campaign against Serbia.\n",
      "These began on August 3 at the Great Headquarters in Plesk with the envoy sent by the Bulgarian government, Lieutenant Colonel Gantchew. However, the course of the negotiations experienced a significant delay due to the tense situation at the Dardanelles, particularly due to the sinking of the American steamer \"Arabic\" by a German submarine on August 19. The new serious diplomatic disputes between Germany and the United States that arose from this did not fail to have their psychological impact on Bulgaria's stance. Only after the situation eased did the negotiations lead to the conclusion of a military convention between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria on September 5. It seems by no means excluded that the concern about a separate peace between Serbia and the Central Powers significantly influenced the Bulgarian government's final decisions. On September 15, Turkey joined the military convention.\n",
      "Bulgaria's accession to the alliance of the Central Powers was a success of great political and military significance, which would probably not remain without repercussions on the other Balkan states. If it was now possible to overthrow Serbia — and there could hardly be any doubt about that — then for Austria-Hungary the threat of flanking, which had existed since the beginning of the war, was eliminated and the worst crisis at the Dardanelles was overcome. The establishment of secure connections with the Orient opened up new possibilities for Turkey's warfare in Asia, united the Ottoman Empire with the Central Powers and Bulgaria into a solid alliance, and above all, finally blocked the shortest connection line between Russia and the allied Western powers.</body>\n",

      "However, the hopes held by the Supreme Army Command in July for the defeat of the main Russian forces in Poland were not fully realized. By early August, as mentioned¹), it had to be seriously considered that the Russians would succeed in evading the encirclement intended for them in the area between the Vistula and Narew through a skillfully and vigorously executed retreat. The last opportunity to achieve the hoped-for decisive campaign success through a new operation presented itself, according to the Commander-in-Chief East, around the end of July/August. General von Falkenhayn, upon his return from the Metz conference in Plesb (per request²), proposed shifting the focus from the Narew to the Niemen front. If the operation proposed by the Commander-in-Chief East on June 2 in Posen was to be successfully carried out at all, Field Marshal von Hindenburg believed there was no time to lose. However, General von Falkenhayn's approval of this plan would not only have required the cessation of the pursuit operation in Poland, which was no longer operationally decisive but still considered very promising, but also the deployment of all available reinforcements, including significant parts of the army reserve from the Western Front, on the left wing of the German Eastern Army — possibly even postponing the Serbian campaign to an as yet undetermined time. The Chief of the General Staff no longer considered a campaign decision achievable by this means based on previous experiences. On the other hand, he feared that the substantial forces to be deployed for such an offensive would be unavailable for use on other fronts for the foreseeable future. However, he considered the partial execution of the Serbian campaign more necessary given the overall war situation than even the most noteworthy further successes on the Eastern Front. Accordingly, he believed he had to limit the objectives in the East. Here, a \"decisive victory corresponding to the purposes of the Supreme Army Command\" sufficed for him. He hoped to achieve such a victory most quickly through the vigorous continuation of the ongoing operations, in which the enemy should continue to be weakened in his combat power as much as possible.\n",

      "Above all, the Metz meeting at the end of July had already strengthened General von Falkenhayn's conviction that the German Western Front, \"like an iron wall,\" stood unshakably firm and was capable of withstanding all storms despite the great numerical superiority of the enemy. The victorious defense against the previous heavy enemy attacks had created a confident mood throughout the German front. Thus, the essential backing for operations on other fronts seemed to be secured here as well.\n",
      "As an army reserve, 8½ infantry divisions were available behind the Western Front. At the end of July, General von Falkenhayn considered using this reserve mainly for an operation in Upper Alsace to clear German soil of the enemy, an idea that had occupied him, albeit temporarily, since June. During the Metz meeting, the Chief of Staff of the 5th Army, Lieutenant General Schmidt von Knobelsdorf, was instructed to carry out the necessary reconnaissance in Upper Alsace; General von Falkenhayn considered the deployment of six divisions sufficient for the operation.\n",
      "The result of the reconnaissance was discussed on August 28 in a meeting between Generals von Falkenhayn and Schmidt von Knobelsdorf in Berlin and presented by the former to the Supreme War Lord on August 30. On this day, the diary of Colonel General von Plessen records: \"Our supreme army command is considering an advance in Upper Alsace to drive the enemy out of the last piece of Germany.\" Simultaneously, however, towards the end of August, calculations by the intelligence department of the Supreme Army Command showed that the Western powers had approximately 50 infantry divisions behind the front.\n",

      "<body>The question of how Germany should defend itself in the event of a multi-front war against its opponents in the West and East had been decided by the long-standing Chief of the Prussian General Staff, Count Schlieffen, to immediately throw the main mass of the German army against the French and English, while initially conducting the fight against Russia with a minimum of forces in strategic defense without direct connection with the Austro-Hungarian ally. His successor, General von Moltke, had maintained the basic idea of this planned solution, but had promised the Chief of Staff of the allied army to support the offensive intended from Galicia into Poland by his own attack from East Prussia against the Russians, in order to bind the Russian forces facing the German Eastern Front and prevent them from intervening against the allied forces. At the outbreak of war, the attack against the Russians had not taken place because the German 8th Army in East Prussia initially had to defend itself against the concentric pressure of the Russian 1st and 2nd Armies advancing against it from two sides. By destroying one of these armies at Tannenberg and severely shaking the other in the Battle of the Masurian Lakes, the front of the ally had been relieved to a much greater extent than the Chiefs of Staff had anticipated in their peacetime agreements. Nevertheless, the failures in Galicia had significantly increased the difficulties of the task of maintaining the balance against the superior Russian forces, especially since the hoped-for quick decision by arms in the West had not materialized.\n",
      "When General von Falkenhayn took over the leadership of the overall operations of the German army in mid-September 1914, he had adhered to the basic idea that the final decision in the world war must and would fall on French soil against the Western powers. In this, he agreed with both the Austro-Hungarian Chief of Staff and the Commander-in-Chief East, as important as the question was, on which path this final reckoning should be pursued, and what significance the fight against Russia now had in this context, the views of the responsible personalities already differed greatly in the autumn of 1914.</body>\n",

      "<body>on how this final settlement should be pursued, what significance the fight against Russia now had, the views of the responsible personalities already differed greatly in the autumn of 1914. While General von Conrad and soon after also the Commander-in-Chief East, after the failure of the Ypres offensive, believed that the military defeat of Russia must precede the decisive battle against the Western powers, the German General Staff saw the uninterrupted continuation of the attempt to subdue the French and English as the overriding task. He wanted the fight against Russia to continue only as a holding action, to gain time, as a backing for the German Western Front. While offensive strikes were certainly to be sought, the German deployment in the East should remain within the narrowest possible limits.\n",
      "This viewpoint remained decisive for General von Falkenhayn even after the final failure of the German attacks in Flanders in mid-November, when he could no longer ignore the realization that the time when the decisive battle in the West could be fought with a prospect of success had been postponed. His guiding thought remained the earliest possible resumption. Although by the end of November, given the predicament in which the conduct of war in the East had fallen due to the superiority of the Russians, a significant reinforcement of the Eastern Army could no longer be avoided. Nevertheless, General von Falkenhayn still saw its task at the end of 1914 merely as \"pushing the Russians back to the Vistula or into their bridgeheads, otherwise clearing up the Russian parts standing opposite West Prussia and in East Prussia as quickly as possible, but then limiting itself to a more holding conduct of war.\"(1) A similar task, in his view, fell to the leadership of the Austro-Hungarian army in Galicia and Serbia, \"with whose solution they have enough to do for the winter months.\"(1)\n",
      "However, it would be wrong to see the restraint of the German Chief of Staff towards the proposals of the leaders on the Eastern Front, aimed at a decisive conduct of war against Russia, as an expression of rigid adherence to his once chosen solution, according to which the decision in the West was to be pursued directly. His restraint corresponded much more to fundamental considerations about the peculiarities of the theater of war and the resulting possibilities of success and views of the war against Russia.</body>\n",

      "<body>the success possibilities and views of the war against Russia arising from the mutual balance of forces. When in those days General Wild von Hohenborn proposed in a memorandum to shift the focus of German warfare from the western theater to the eastern and to seek the decision there first, General von Falkenhayn noted in the margin of this memorandum that \"a complete military overthrow of Russia is to be achieved.\" It is difficult to assume that he drew such far-reaching conclusions solely based on the previous results of operations on the Eastern Front, which, despite brilliant victories of the commander-in-chief, often remained without decisive impact. Undoubtedly, even then, his judgment was decisively influenced by the question of force requirements and the consideration of the immeasurably vast operational space of the Russian Empire, viewpoints that General von Falkenhayn repeatedly asserted in the further course of the campaign in the East. He was convinced that for the decisive offensive in the East, a deployment of forces was necessary that far exceeded what he could muster with regard to the security of the Western Front. A shortening of this front by straightening or withdrawing the existing positions and a large-scale saving of forces was out of the question for him, given the paramount importance he attached to holding every inch of ground in France and Belgium. But even if a significant saving of forces for the East could be achieved, any attempt to strive for the desired final decision against the eastern colossus seemed doomed to failure due to the enormous difficulty of preventing the Russians from retreating into the interior of their empire. \"Napoleon's experiences did not invite imitation of his example.\"\n",
      "With this fundamental attitude, it was not difficult for the head of the German overall operations at the beginning of 1915 to reject a proposal from the Austrian Chief of Staff, which aimed to force a breakthrough through the Russian front in West Poland between Nida and Pilica towards Radom by \"ruthlessly deploying new German forces from the West or from new formations\" and thereby achieve \"a full, decisive success.\" Also, the intention expressed shortly thereafter by General von Conrad to launch a major offensive from the Carpathian Front to deliver a decisive blow, whose effect he estimated far higher than mere territorial gain up to the San-Dniester line, was met with strong reservations by General von Falkenhayn from the outset.</body>\n",

The history of the decision's formation reveals that suggestions from the circle of trusted advisors of General von Falkenhayn, especially from the Army High Command Mackensen and the Austro-Hungarian military leadership, played a decisive role. However, the German Chief of General Staff knew how to process these suggestions into a plan, rejecting those that seemed too far-reaching or inappropriate, in which his unchanged fundamental stance on the question of the fight against Russia was decisive. He certainly recognized that a turning point in the conduct of the war in the East had been reached, where a spatial and temporal expansion of the operational goal was urgently desirable and permissible, considering the general war situation, through the powerful exploitation of the partial successes achieved so far into a unified strike. However, he was not prepared for a further increase in the deployment of forces by further utilizing the resources of the Western theater of war; on the contrary, he sent two divisions back there. Painstakingly avoiding falling into \"boundless plans,\" he set himself a task, in full agreement with Generaloberst von Conrad, that seemed achievable with the available forces, considering the overall situation of the Central Powers. Again, he wanted to bring the Russians into a situation by weakening and paralyzing their offensive power \"where they would not be able to become dangerous to us in the foreseeable future.\" The long-standing intention, reluctantly postponed time and again, to assist the Turkish ally by subduing Serbia, also made a solution desirable that promised the early conclusion of offensive operations in Russia. On this basis, the idea of the closest possible concentric cooperation of the Mackensen army group and the Commander-in-Chief East in the area between the Bug, Vistula, and lower Narew suggested itself. A setback seemed almost impossible here, even if the offensive should not penetrate or stall halfway in the worst case. General von Falkenhayn, however, believed in the success of the operation and hoped for a great, also operationally significant success, \"the cutting off of the enemy masses standing at the Vistula and in front of Mackensen.\"1) In this, he saw a \"decisive victory corresponding to the purposes of the Supreme Army Command.\" The then Prussian Minister of War, General Wild von Hohenborn, has, in retrospect, expressed himself in a record dated August 27, 1915, as follows:</body>\n",

      "<body>Looking back on this in a record from August 27, 1915, it was stated as follows: \"Falkenhayn initially only wanted to reach the San, then he was driven to Lemberg, then came the thrust along the Bug. Everything developed historically, as if by itself, one thing from another. Initially, no one here thought of a final major operation. Only later will the matter be portrayed as a brilliant plan in history. But those who were involved know that strategy is a simple thing, where one limited goal follows another, to then present a proud overall picture, at which the layman thinks God knows what. Incidentally, Falkenhayn merely followed his own operational thinking when he acted differently than Hindenburg suggested.\"\n",
      "However, the question arises whether the fundamental view of General von Falkenhayn, emphasized here as well, regarding the limited effectiveness of any offensive operation in the vast spaces of Russia, provides a sufficient explanation for his behavior in the opinion dispute with the Commander-in-Chief East that began in early July. If he rejected the operation proposed by the latter \"north of the Njemen with simultaneous attack on Kowno\" with the reasoning that it \"ran the risk of scattering in an eccentric direction and merely leading to greater expansion\"¹), one misses an examination of the success possibilities and prospects of the idea, as it seems, initially only hinted at, but nevertheless obvious, of an offensive on and over Wilna. An examination would have easily revealed that this offensive, in terms of effort, time, and space, did not pursue \"nebulous goals\" at all, that it could be conducted as well as the Narew operation within the framework of deliberately limited warfare, that it hardly faced greater supply difficulties like this one, but that it promised an operational, depth-fed, much greater impact, because its thrust direction immediately threatened the main lifelines of the Russian army north of the Rokitno swamps. This operational effect could still be increased if, at the same time, from the opposite direction from the south, a strong pressure was exerted from the beginning on the area east of the Bug against the rear connections to Russia south of the swamps by the Mackensen army group. One may ponder the much-debated question of whether in the summer of 1915 an operation aimed at a double-sided encirclement in this sense could have led to the destruction of large parts of the Russian army and thereby the campaign decision hoped for by the Commander-in-Chief East, think as one might, one thing should be beyond question, that the mere threat to the enemy's rear in the thrust directions over Wilna and east of the Bug must have had a momentous impact on the behavior of the main mass of Russians standing in Poland.</body>\n",

      "However, these wishes and hopes were not fulfilled. Despite all efforts and exertions of the pursuers, the enemy always and everywhere evaded capture. By mid-August, General von Falkenhayn could no longer deny the truth of the Eastern Commander's statement: “The operation in the East has ... not led to the destruction of the enemy. The Russian has, as expected, evaded the length and allows himself to be pushed back frontally in the direction he desires”2). The German Chief of Staff, however, easily reconciled himself to this operationally unsatisfactory result as a natural process, which one had to try to disturb and hinder, but could not prevent. His rapid change of mood becomes understandable when one considers the fundamental idea that had always dominated him, that a “complete military overthrow of Russia would never be achieved.” With this consistently held fundamental idea, it was not difficult for him to see the recent events in a favorable light. Not disappointment over a minor operational result took place, but satisfaction with a performance fully sufficient for the purposes of the Supreme Army Command. Thus, General von Falkenhayn perceived the inherently manifold findings of the Eastern Commander as unjustified criticism and saw in them only new evidence that the command authority held completely false ideas about the limits of success that were drawn for any offensive operation in Russia. In his response, he stated3):\n",
      "“A destruction of the enemy has never been hoped for from the ongoing operations in the East, but merely a decisive victory corresponding to the purposes of the Supreme Army Command ...” For a complete destruction, “the basic conditions are simply lacking. For one cannot strive to destroy an enemy who is numerically far superior and facing frontally, who has excellent connections, unlimited time, and unrestricted space, while one is forced to operate in railway-less, path-poor terrain with a tight time limit in deploying very limited forces, some of which are not even resistant troops.” Following this, General von Falkenhayn strongly emphasized the positive achievements of his operation and claimed credit for them, stating that the enemy “is now already decisively defeated for our purposes, as the Russians, apart from their enormous loss of prisoners and material, have lost Galicia, Poland, and Courland and are no longer in a position to seriously threaten Austria-Hungary in the foreseeable future.”</body>\n",

      "General von Falkenhayn consistently adhered to this view until the conclusion of the war of movement in the East in the autumn of 1915. In his decisive agreement to the late execution of the operation of the Commander-in-Chief East on Vilna, he expressly opposed any possibility of defeating an enemy who was determined to retreat without regard for losses in land and people as soon as he was engaged, and who had vast Russia at his disposal1). Even after the unsatisfactory outcome of the Vilna offensive, he reiterated in a letter to the Commander-in-Chief East2) that one could not hope to decisively encircle a numerically superior enemy who would not stand without regard for losses in land and people, with vast Russia and good railways behind him. However, one could harm such an enemy in a manner completely sufficient for our purposes by staying firmly on his blade everywhere, thus binding him in movement and relatively weakening him, but then striking deep into his lines at a well-chosen spot with concentrated forces. He cited the “campaigns of Mackensen, Woyrsch, and Gallwitz” as successful examples of this method.\n",
      "Yet, the last phase of the war of movement in 1915 in Russia shows that the repeatedly stated commitment to warfare with limited objectives did not spare the German Chief of General Staff from confronting the conflicting desires and interests of his own strategy in practical action. From the end of August, he found himself in internal conflict. On one hand, he wanted to harm and weaken the enemy as much as possible so that he could not strengthen for an offensive in the foreseeable future; on the other hand, the consideration of the overall situation of the Central Powers urged the quick conclusion of the offensive in Russia to secure sufficient forces for the Serbian campaign and the defense of the Western Front. The attempt to simultaneously and equally account for both viewpoints proved unfeasible. Despite internal resistance, General von Falkenhayn was compelled to initially support and relieve the offensive operations of the two army flanks, initially conceived as special undertakings with limited objectives, with the forces of the army center to an extent that far exceeded his original intentions.</body>\n",

For the overall conduct of the war, it would undoubtedly have been more in line with General von Falkenhayn's standpoint if he had adhered to the decision to break off operations in the East at the end of August and consequently also prevented the special operations of the two army wings. It would then have been possible to launch the offensive against Serbia at an earlier time with the equally strong forces intended for both allies, thus avoiding the highly undesirable increase in the German contingent, and also to make strong reserves available in time for use on the western theater of war.\n",
      "Thus, the war of movement of 1915 in the East concluded with significant territorial gains, as far as the German front was concerned, but not with a severe disruption of the combat power of the Russians. Yet they still held the field. The success was bought with all the disadvantages that the Central Powers fighting on the inner line faced in fixing substantial forces and resources in extended positions deep in enemy territory. Whether this result, achieved with a conscious renunciation of decisive warfare, was sufficient in terms of strategic rear security to now resume the decisive battle against the French and English with a prospect of success was the fateful question facing the German Supreme Army Command at the turn of the year 1915/1916.</body>\n",

Since the troop overviews of the German Western Armies taken in advance by the Reichsarchiv only cover the reference dates between April 5 and June 30, 1915 — almost a quarter of a year apart — errors in today's calculation are unavoidable. 91 battalions that were missing in the overviews are included. Landsturm battalions are only counted as far as they were actually at the front, and fortress garrisons only those from Metz (excluding Landsturm). Recruit depots have been disregarded.\n",
      "Based on the information provided by the Intelligence Department at the Chief of the General Staff of the Field Army up to June 11, the following emerges:\n",
      "The number of French battalions in France was 1326. This includes all known Territorial Divisions — also those presumed to be in Paris at the time — as well as the divisions 151, 152, 155, which are considered questionable.\n",
      "The British Army in France comprised 399 battalions. This includes seven English active battalions, 46 Territorial battalions, and 46 Indian battalions outside the divisional association, as well as 72 battalions of divisions 9 and 10, which were presumed to be in France. The presence of these 166 battalions was partly only assumed (agent reports); partly their usability as front-line troops was questionable.\n",
      "The number of Belgian battalions was 61.\n",

For use in the expeditionary corps to be sent to France, initially only the regular troops stationed at home (332,000 men) and those Territorial troops who had volunteered to serve outside the country in case of danger (17,621 men) were considered, totaling around 350,000 men.\n",
      "On August 5, 1914, the House of Commons approved an increase in the regular army by 500,000 men. On August 6, Lord Kitchener, appointed Secretary of State for War, considered this measure insufficient and further reinforcement necessary. He planned to establish a whole series of new, so-called \"Kitchener\" divisions in addition to the existing units. The training of these formations was to take place in special camps according to needs through recruitment. On August 7, 1914, the government issued a call through posters and the press for the voluntary enlistment of 100,000 recruits. The number continued to increase from August 8 to 12. By mid-September 1914, 500,000 volunteers had already been enlisted. Restrictive measures had to be issued because the existing military facilities could not cope with such an expansion of the army. Accommodation and procurement of the necessary clothing and equipment posed difficulties. Needs could largely only be met through contracts with foreign countries. A significant issue was the lack of training personnel. On August 17, a law was passed allowing the reinstatement of discharged non-commissioned officers. In addition to the deferment of 500 officers just transferred to India on Lord Kitchener's orders, the recruitment of all available active officers, reserve officers, Territorial officers of the training corps, unassigned and re-enlisted officers, especially non-commissioned officers promoted to officers, served to create the lower leadership personnel.\n",
      "The lack of sufficient weapons severely hampered training. On October 11, the government was forced to lift some of the restrictive measures issued in mid-September due to a sharp decline in volunteer enlistments. At the same time, a Parliamentary Recruitment Committee was established to organize recruitment activities uniformly. While the other arms continued to be supplemented from existing depots, the entire country was divided into districts for infantry volunteer replacements, generally corresponding to regions, with larger cities forming their own districts. Each of these districts was to supply recruits for a specific regiment. Recruitment for the Territorial troops continued alongside.\n",

      "In total, the number of volunteers enlisted by the end of 1914 was 1,186,337 men, with an average number for the months of November 1914 to June 1915 of 125,000.\n",
      "On May 19, 1915, Lord Kitchener issued a new call for an additional 300,000 recruits. This time, the effect fell short of previous results, with only 115,000 men enlisting in June.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the disadvantages for the war-essential industries of the country had become apparent, as they lost about 33% of their workforce to the armed forces. To prevent this, the government was forced to introduce the \"National Registration Act\" on July 15, 1915, i.e., the compulsory registration of all male and female British citizens aged 15 to 65 by age, gender, residence, occupation, and fitness. After these lists were completed on September 15, certain industries were closed to volunteers. The lists of men aged 18 to 41 were handed over to the recruitment authorities so that the relevant individuals, as long as they did not belong to exempted professions, could initiate increased recruitment activities.\n",
      "On October 11, 1915, Lord Derby was appointed as the Director-General of Recruiting. He already presented a bill (Derby Scheme) on October 16, representing the last attempt to adhere to the volunteer system. It was still allowed to report at a specific time or to a unit. Those who did not want to do this were to enroll in special lists with the obligation to follow the government's call to arms in times of danger. Upon the acceptance of the law, Prime Minister Asquith assured that in case of need, unmarried men would be called upon first. By December 15, 1915, 2,184,979 men had enrolled in these Derby lists, while 215,431 men reported for immediate service during the same period. The total number of volunteers enlisted in 1915 was 1,280,362.\n",
      "The volunteer units were organized into Kitchener Divisions for training, which were grouped into Kitchener Armies, each consisting of six divisions. The 1st Kitchener Army was formed on August 21, 1914, the 2nd on September 9, 1914, and the 3rd on September 13, 1914. The 4th and 5th Armies already existed in September 1914 but were reorganized and only received their final form on April 27, 1915.\n",
      "Of the Kitchener Divisions, which were numbered from 9 to 26 and from 30 to 41, 26 were deployed in France, 3 at the Dardanelles, and 2 initially in Egypt, later in France. By the end of 1915, 21 divisions had arrived in France, one of which was transferred back to Malta in November 1915. Deployment to the front occurred, unless events forced other conditions, only after training behind the front for about three months.\n",
      "The combat value of the Kitchener Divisions, according to English judgment, never reached that of the old regular divisions. The goodwill of leaders and troops, their intellectual abilities, and their zeal could not compensate for the incomplete training and lack of experience.\n",
