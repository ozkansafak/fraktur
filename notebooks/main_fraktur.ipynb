An early, strongly superior offensive by the Russians against East Prussia would, as further explained, in itself bring about the desired result. If such a result does not occur, the German Eastern Army will advance into Russia in a direction that brings the greatest relief to the Austrian army.” — The corps prepared against Tschenstochau—Kalisch is to carry out such an operation under all circumstances, to begin on the 12th day of mobilization (= August 13) and to march relentlessly over Radom against the Vistula above Iwangrod. — “The Austrian army can thus definitely count on active support for its offensive into Russia from all the forces marching in the east of Germany. The joint success will be all the greater, the earlier and more relentlessly the advance into Russia takes place.”\n",

Conrad replied on August 4 that the following Austro-Hungarian forces would march against Russia: 38½ infantry divisions [that was 2 fewer than planned for the “Russia Case”4); they were then missing from the 4th Army5)], 12 March Brigades [they corresponded roughly to the German replacement brigades, but were without any artillery and therefore only represented a significant infantry reinforcement5)], 8 Landsturm Brigades [they corresponded to the German Landwehr brigades, but had even less artillery than these5)], 10 Cavalry Divisions [1 fewer than planned for the “Russia Case”4)5)].\n",

Based on intelligence about measures during the Balkan Wars of 1912/13, the memorandum further explained that this \"war preparation period\" allowed, in times of political tension, \"to assign supplementary personnel and horses to the troops before the start of actual mobilization\" and to prepare these units to such an extent that they could ultimately be ready to march on the 1st or 2nd day of mobilization.

He said the offensive with the right wing on Warsaw was intended for a much later point in the war. That he had promised such an offensive for the start of the war was unthinkable, as he was in no way authorized to do so and considered an attack deep into enemy territory before the arrival of significant reinforcements from the west to be completely out of the question.

       "The command against Russia, which might become desirable or even necessary, was dispensable for the first weeks of the war. The extremely delicate and hardly satisfactorily solvable question of the supreme command in the East was therefore not addressed in the peace negotiations between the two chiefs of staff. As far as the position of the allied powers towards each other seemed possible, the cooperation of the German and Austro-Hungarian forces for the case of war was regulated. That nevertheless differences of opinion remained in the basic views is not surprising given the nature of the alliance relationship: Thus, General v. Conrad never completely abandoned the idea of possibly waging a war in the Balkans, regardless of the considerable weakening of the forces available against Russia and the resulting additional burden on Germany. General v. Moltke, on the other hand, always considered the role of Austria-Hungary for the beginning of the war only from the perspective that the decision sought against France — on which ultimately everything depended — should not be questioned by Russia's advance. This danger grew with the increasing strengthening of Russia and the year-by-year increasing acceleration of its deployment. Moreover, the military situation of Austria-Hungary had become more difficult due to Serbia's uncertain stance since 1913. It became all the more important that in the event of a war it was not distracted by its Balkan opponents, but concentrated all its strength against Russia. Although no decision was initially sought against this country, the fight against Russia had to be conducted offensively. If General v. Conrad delayed his deployment, as he had repeatedly indicated, or limited himself to defense, then the Russians gained full freedom of action according to General v. Moltke's view and had the choice to attack Austria-Hungary or Germany with united force. But on the German front, the forces here were smaller, and ultimately it would also be clear to the Russians that not the direction towards Vienna, but towards Berlin was decisive for the overall situation. If the Russian masses advanced towards Berlin without much delay, it would \"spur France's resistance to the utmost, even after severe defeats, and eventually force German forces to retreat from the west to protect the capital.\"1). Whether it would still be possible to bring the decisive battle in the West to a victorious conclusion appeared extremely questionable.\n",

Prittwitz kept the I Army Corps at Gumbinnen and northwards. The 1st Cavalry Division and the 2nd Landwehr Brigade, positioned behind the Inster at Kraupischken and northwards, remained under General v. François. His troops were thus 10 km ahead of the rest of the front. The intentions behind this deployment are not known. It almost seems as if they did not want to order General v. François to retreat again. Presumably, he sought to direct the operations into the paths he deemed correct. He continued to anticipate the Russians' intention to envelop his northern flank. To have a powerful force at hand against this, he wanted to move his southern, 2nd Infantry Division behind the left flank. The High Command agreed with this intention and provided him on the evening of August 18 with the main reserve from Königsberg, stationed south of Insterburg, for his right flank as reinforcement. The information available to the Army High Command until then suggested that the advance of the Russian Narew Army was also nearing its end. They simultaneously indicated an extension of the western flank of this army through troop concentration in the area previously reported free by the enemy around and west of Warsaw: By August 15, all Germans and Austrians were to have been expelled from Lodz, as troops were expected. There was active military traffic around Warsaw, troops were arriving. Parts of the Russian I Corps were reported to have marched from the area west of the city towards Nowogeorgiewsk. Further east, the Russians had already begun their advance on the Narew line. Airmen had determined that on the morning of August 18, at least one Russian division had advanced about 15 km from Ostrolenka to the west and another from Lomsha to the northwest and then had gone to rest. Overall, this enemy was estimated at about two corps. In front of him was cavalry pushed closer to the border.</body></b>"

       "<body>Hold the Guard Corps. In the following days, all troops near and west of Warsaw were subordinated to it. Among them were two infantry regiments from the I Corps, the 5th and the Caucasian Cavalry Division already present, the Guard Cossack Brigade from Petersburg and a Turkestan Cossack Brigade on the move, as well as the garrisons for Warsaw, 59th, and 77th, and Novogeorgiewsk, 79th Reserve Division. While the 2nd Army advanced to attack northward, these 5 1/2 infantry divisions and 3 1/2 cavalry divisions were assigned a secondary task: the commanding general of the Guard Corps, General Bespajrow, was to cover between Warsaw and its Vistula crossings, clear the land up to the line Plock—Lodz—Petrikau—Piliza course from the enemy and prepare the later attack in the direction of Bromberg—Posen. While the Guard Corps was thus completely excluded from the operations of General Samsonow, its authority over the (weakened by two regiments) I Corps was simultaneously restricted, so that the corps could only be advanced to the area of Soldau. The main task of this corps was to cover the attack movement of the 2nd Army against Thorn; only if there was no danger from this side should it be drawn into battle. After these assignments and restrictions, the forces with which General Samsonow could appear on the battlefield in the coming days had melted down against the first approach. However, they were considered sufficient, in cooperation with the Njemen Army, to prepare the downfall of the German forces, which had until then been assumed to be behind the lakes, especially since these were now considered defeated after the battles of Stallupönen and Gumbinnen. This view, that the 1st and 2nd Armies should suffice for the battle in East Prussia, had some justification. The withdrawal of the very strong security forces for western Poland was, however, a voluntary renunciation of a surplus of forces for the decision initially intended in East Prussia. The Narew Army had advanced on August 21 and 22 in small marches, with four corps in the front line and a front width of almost 80 km, not as ordered not west of the lakes to the north, but in an almost northwesterly direction. This direction seemed operationally particularly effective, also exerting attraction beyond the railway to Allenstein. The high command was in Ostrolenka. The Supreme Army Command and Army Group Command, which had been in Bjelostok since August 19, urged haste. But the troops were already exhausted and inadequately supplied¹).</body>\n",

These orders corresponded to the army order, but given the time found at the 1st Infantry Division, they were only feasible if everything was prepared to ensure the timely deployment of the troops for the early attack. Nothing had happened here. General v. François was still of the opinion that his army corps was not yet in a position to attack on the morning of August 26th. The damage that a delay could cause seemed insignificant to him compared to the risk of a hasty advance. He was reinforced in this view by the fact that the chief of staff of the XX Army Corps, Colonel Hell, replied to an inquiry at night that the situation of the XX Army Corps did not justify a hasty attack. At the 1st Infantry Division, the night corps order was received by telephone at 12:30 a.m. However, there were such significant frictions and delays in transmission and execution that the beginnings of the division finally reached the Welle section at Lautschen and Juskity only at 9 a.m. Due to the inactivity of the Russian advance troops, the deployment was achieved here without losses. The division commander, Lieutenant General v. Conta, wanted to conduct the attack over open field in broad daylight only after sufficient artillery preparation. In total, he had only four batteries available so far. The division was also initially completely on its own, as the 2nd Infantry Division could, according to the corps order, be at Groß-Roschlau at the earliest at 10 a.m. Thus, Lieutenant General v. Conta decided to postpone the attack until the arrival of further artillery. General v. François, who arrived shortly after 8 a.m. in the front line east of Lautschen at the staff of the 1st Infantry Division, agreed with the intention of the division commander. However, this also meant that the attack on Usdau had to be postponed. General v. François therefore ordered the 2nd Infantry Division and the 5th Landwehr Brigade not to cross Groß-Roschlau and Klein-Tauersee for the time being. He reported to the army command at 8:15 that the attack on Usdau was delayed due to the late arrival of the troops.</body></b>"

       "<body>Russian division standing. Opposite the German 36th Infantry Division, the enemy continued to move further east and thereby temporarily put their left flank in a difficult position. General staff and division had the impression of facing the entire Russian VI Corps. However, the German 35th Infantry Division had not yet arrived by noon. They had to rest on the way. When they finally reached Groß-Koellen with the vanguard after a 25 km march, they were so exhausted that they had to rest again. Meanwhile, the I Reserve Corps, which initially had no enemy in front of it, had only completed its deployment west of the Seenette in the line Alt-Bierzighufen—Kirschdorf by 12:30 p.m. In agreement with General v. Mackensen, General v. Below now wanted to continue the march south with the mass of his corps to swing in against the rear parts of the enemy south of the Daden Lake. Weaker forces were to — at the request of the XVII Army Corps — strike the flank of the enemy opposite this army corps at Groß-Bössiau. The Russian 4th Infantry Division was completely surprised by the approach of German forces from the north. Initially, they believed they only had a flank guard of the Germans marching westward from Rastenburg in front of them. The Russian division commander wanted to attack and simultaneously pushed a detachment for cover over Groß-Bössiau to the west. As a result, larger parts of the German I Reserve Corps were drawn in. Finally, at Groß-Bössiau, the commander of the 36th Reserve Division, Major General Krüger, attacked with the majority of his division and the 6th Landwehr Brigade. The 69th Reserve Brigade under Major General v. Homeyer and the 6th Landwehr Brigade under Major General Krahmer bore the main work of the day. At Klein-Bössiau, the enemy, with the lake at their back, resisted to the utmost. In a heroic but particularly officer-heavy costly assault, the Pomeranian Landwehr Regiments 34 and 49 took the village in the evening. Several hundred prisoners and some guns were their spoils. Meanwhile, the beginnings of the 1st Reserve Division at the southern end of the Daden Lake had also repelled weaker enemy forces advancing from the east. It was the beginning of the Russian 16th Infantry Division, which, according to the army order, had been set in motion by General Blagowjeschtschenski towards Wartenburg—Allenstein before knowing the situation at Groß-Bössiau, but later turned north.</body></b>"

       "<body>The idea of the double envelopment arose naturally from the situation the new leaders encountered on August 23. Whether this idea was feasible depended on the Russian Njemen Army and, since the corps of the German Eastern Group marched south, on the outcome of their battle against the local enemy. Thus, the Army High Command could initially only strive for the destruction of Samsonov's army through an attack from the west. However, time and resources were insufficient to use the most effective means for this, the envelopment with a strong southern wing, possibly via Soldau. Therefore, General Major Ludendorff proposed the attack against the front at Usdau and further towards Neidenburg. The battle began with a \"breakthrough\"; the attack on Usdau was also intended to simultaneously cut off the Russian center and northern wing from their rear connections. Only from the afternoon of August 27 did the opportunity arise to conduct their encirclement with the cooperation of the Eastern Group. This opportunity was immediately seized, and the encirclement, despite multiple frictions and misunderstandings within the own army and despite new threats from outside, was brought to a brilliant conclusion in further four-day battles. A series of spatially and temporally separated and initially more or less independently conducted victorious skirmishes, in which fighting took place with the front in all directions, was ultimately shaped by the hand of the upper leadership into a great final success. The success of such an undertaking, overcoming all opposing difficulties, would not have been conceivable without the understanding initiative of all involved sub-leaders and the incomparable achievements of the troops. This will be discussed at a later point in this book. The entire six-day battle was fought under constant threat to the German right wing from Warsaw and the left by the Russian Njemen Army. They only needed to advance, and the battle would have had to be abandoned — perhaps with great own losses. This dangerous situation has weighed heavily on the German leadership and repeatedly raised doubts about whether stronger forces should be withdrawn from the battle to cover against Rennenkampf. After Leipzig, Metz, and Sedan, Tannenberg stands as the largest encirclement battle known to world history. It was conducted, in contrast to these, against a numerically superior enemy, while simultaneously both flanks were threatened by further superior forces.</body></b>"

Count Waldersee reportedly spoke of a deployment in East Prussia \"with the tendency of an offensive directed at Warsaw with the right wing.\" This promise, as General v. Conrad further reports, \"took into account his demand for an offensive in the general direction of Siedlce.\" — Count Waldersee stated that there must be a misunderstanding. He said the offensive with the right wing on Warsaw was intended for a much later point in the war. That he had promised such an offensive for the start of the war was unthinkable, as he was in no way authorized to do so and considered an attack deep into enemy territory before the arrival of significant reinforcements from the west to be completely out of the question.

       "1) General v. Conrad mentions in his memoirs (Volume IV, p. 87ff.) a discussion with the then Quartermaster General in the Great General Staff, Major General Count v. Waldersee, who was in Vienna in January 1913 on behalf of General v. Moltke. Count Waldersee reportedly spoke of a deployment in East Prussia \"with the tendency of an offensive directed at Warsaw with the right wing.\" This promise, as General v. Conrad further reports, \"took into account his demand for an offensive in the general direction of Siedlce.\" — Count Waldersee stated that there must be a misunderstanding. He said the offensive with the right wing on Warsaw was intended for a much later point in the war. That he had promised such an offensive for the start of the war was unthinkable, as he was in no way authorized to do so and considered an attack deep into enemy territory before the arrival of significant reinforcements from the west to be completely out of the question. There was complete agreement between General v. Moltke and him on this. 2) E. 43. — 3) See organizational chart in Appendix 1. 4) The German \"Army High Commands\" corresponded to the \"Army Commands\" at the head of the individual armies. 5) See p. 50 for German and Austro-Hungarian liaison officers. 6) p. 26.\n",

       "<body>To tie up reserves there so that they could not be moved south against the German attack wing. Thus, the German corps were to close north of the lakes on September 7 in the line Rastenburg—Friedland. In the army order for that day it said: \"Should the enemy take the offensive, the corps are to hold the line reached.\" For their own safety and to tie up the Russian reserves, more troops for the northern wing would have been urgently desired. Apart from the main reserve from Posen, no significant reinforcements were available. The army command considered bringing in parts from the East Prussian eastern front. But everything there was in flux to the east, the flank was getting longer every day, there was nothing free. The government of Königsberg was ordered to push stronger forces than before for use south of the Pregel. But no more than at most 1–2 brigades could be counted on. So the army command resorted to a ruse: On the morning of September 7, it had the Königsberg radio station openly give the following radio message: \"General Command Guard Corps, hurry, urgent. — Guard Corps closes hard west of Labiau by tomorrow. — Unloaded parts of the V Army Corps . . .\" (followed by a series of random letters) \"... Army Command.\" This radio message was overheard by the enemy and immediately passed on. On September 7, the German corps reached their marching goals north of the lakes without coming into contact with the enemy. For September 8, the army command ordered to approach the enemy and take their positions. In the south, immediately north of Lake Mauer, where it was necessary to support the attack of the encircling group, it was to be tackled only when this group itself was close enough; before that, it could only reveal the intention and cause the enemy to strengthen their southern wing. Just north, the protruding corner of the Russian position at Gerdauen was to form a suitable attack point. On the other hand, at Rastenburg, given the own limited forces and the strong Russian reserves reported there, restraint seemed advisable. Accordingly, the army command held back the southernmost, XX Army Corps for September 8. Its right wing division (41st) was to stand ready at Rastenburg to follow the XVII Army Corps via Löben or also to be used in a northern direction, the other was to initially cover the flank of the attack on Gerdauen. Against this place, the XI Army Corps and the I Reserve Corps (including the 6th Landwehr Brigade), in total 4½ divisions were deployed.</body></b>"

       "<body>5th Landwehr Brigade on August 26 and 27, the attack of the 6th Landwehr Brigade on the 26th, the Landwehr Division Golz on the 28th, and the Landwehr Corps at Tarnawka are pages of glory for the German Landwehr. To reach the enemy, extraordinary marching achievements had to be demanded from almost all units. After the first days, when the small number of less resilient had fallen out, the marching losses stopped; the troops had become hardened like steel. Thus, they often performed with the dedication of their last strength what was demanded, just as they had practiced and learned so often in peacetime in hard training. Often dead tired and barely supplied, the troops marched on dusty country roads or on deep sandy paths, in the scorching midday heat of August or — as before the Battle of Sumbinnen — through the pitch-black night, to reach the enemy. And when they finally were there, they gathered their last strength for the attack. Whoever had just sunk down from exhaustion pulled themselves together again; duty demanded it, they wanted to — and it worked. Now, on the Russian side, the misfortune of the Narew Army is partly excused by saying that their troops had come to the enemy exhausted from excessively long marches and poorly supplied. This view cannot be maintained, as far as marching efforts are concerned, when comparing what German and Russian troops achieved in this regard at that time: The greatest marches on the Russian side were made by the XIII Corps with 340 km in 15 days (August 13-27 from Bielostok to Allenstein) and the XV with 250 km in 14 days (August 14-27 from south of Lomsha to Hohenstein). In contrast, the German XVII Army Corps, quite apart from the preceding movements in border protection (e.g., at the capture of Mlawa on August 13), covered 310 km in only 12 days (August 19-29 from Darethmen to the Battle of Sumbinnen and from there to south of Willenberg), consisting almost entirely of reserve troops and Landwehr. Another German reserve corps covered 230 km in the same time (from the Angerapp to the Battle of Sumbinnen and from there to east of Schippenstein). In this marching time, both German corps faced the heavy, and for the XVII Army Corps also unfortunate, battle day before Gumbinnen (August 20) and the victorious engagement at Groß-Bössau (August 26), while the Russians, except for parts of the XV Corps, who fought at Lahna and Orlau (August 23/24), made an advance without combat. Great marching achievements were also made by the German XX Army Corps, whose troops initially advanced far to the east to protect the southern border and then had to be brought back to the west.</body></b>"
